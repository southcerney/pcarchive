      <p>Acknowledgements</p>
      </u></font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
      <p>My thanks to Margaret Boakes for her efficient organisation of the
      Bledisloe Cup for 2004. She has done an admirable job, taking over
      smoothly from Graham Stockham who had indeed set a very high standard. And
      thanks, too, to the many judges who assessed the entries at an earlier
      stage. Their detailed and conscientious analyses were very helpful in
      preparation for my inspections and in the field.</p>
      <u><b>
      <p>General remarks</p>
      </b></u>
      <p>As always, judging the Bledisloe Cup was fascinating and difficult.
      Maybe this year it was more challenging than usual because of the very
      different kinds of villages that made it to the final: three from the
      Cotswolds, one from the Vale of Gloucester and two from the Forest of Dean
      area.</p>
      <p>Villages have been judged against the agreed criteria: these can be
      summed up in the answer to the question: 'what community has done the most
      to bring added value to the village environment?' and not - of course -
      'what village looks prettiest?' I have tried to take into account that
      some villages have a much tougher challenge than others, but at the same
      time, one can only judge by results.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, all three winners this year are Cotswold villages, but
      all the others were impressive runners up. It is really important that
      they keep trying — who knows, with a little more effort next year all
      three Bledisloe winners may come from the Vale and Forest of Dean parts of
      Gloucestershire.</p>
      <u><b>
      <p>Final Results</p>
      </b></u>
      <p>I recommend that the following villages should be the winners of the
      Bledisloe Cup for 2004:</p>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Large Village: South Cerney</li>
        <li>Medium-sized Village: Somerford Keynes</li>
        <li>Small Village: Cold Aston</li>
      </ul>
