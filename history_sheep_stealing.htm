    <p class="MsoNormal">South Cerney had for some years a number of expert thieves; the area
    they worked spread over many miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
    thoroughly well organised, and it was not until 1862 that any charge could be really laid
    against them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Six of them were convicted in
    the spring of that year, although the band had been working for ten years previously.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">They had a receiver who owned a horse and cart, so he was able to
    take the fleeces to Fairford for sale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
    also dealt in corn and other commodities. For years it had surprised local inhabitants
    that these men seemed to have plenty of money to spend at the public house.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">They had little trouble in removing the wool and fleeces from barns
    and granaries, as they had bunches of pick locks and false keys.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They always worked well-armed, and after
    conviction, fines and prison sentences, they admitted they were glad they had been
    stopped, as murder would certainly have been committed the first time they had been
    interfered with.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The six who were at last caught and convicted in 1862 were:-</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">John Matthews</span></b>
    who was known at &#145;The King of the Poachers&#146;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>He was born in Glamorganshire in 1822.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>His mother was Welsh, but his father was a Wiltshire man.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">He had every opportunity as a young man, but on account of his bad
    habits his downward course began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He enlisted
    in the Army, but was bought out by friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the age of 21 he was convicted of poaching on the estate of Lord Suffolk at Charlton.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After this. By way of revenge, he, one night,
    scaled a wall, entered his Lordship&#146;s greenhouse and maliciously destroyed a large
    number of vines, strewing the path with the fruit and branches.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a struggle he was caught, and received six
    months imprisonment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1844 he was detected
    poaching at Kemble, and before being overpowered by the Police officer he stabbed this
    officer in the head.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Apparently, although committed for trial at Gloucestershire Assizes,
    he was not convicted owing to some technical point of law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A few weeks later he was imprisoned for two months for poaching at
    Chelworth.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1845 and 1846 he was convicted, again of poaching, and was given
    two months imprisonment on both charges.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">His field of poaching and assaults seems then to have been
    Gloucestershire, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>several convictions are
    recorded in different Petty Sessional divisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    was nearly caught at Chelworth in 1854, but escaped to the land of his birth, where he
    worked as a labourer in the Welsh docks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having
    got into trouble there, he returned to Wiltshire, when he was found in 1856 at Sapperton.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He escaped again, but was eventually caught and
    imprisoned for six months, having assaulted another man.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1859 he was charged with a &#145;mate&#146; at Cirencester Petty
    Sessions, but did not appear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A real chase
    started then, when they were caught at the Fosse Cross Inn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Two years imprisonment followed; in 1861 another three months for poaching
    at Rendcombe.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Having been caught with the gang of thieves in 1862 and tried at
    Devises Quarter Sessions, Matthew was given fifteen months, with hard labour.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">Henry
    Johnsey</span></strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none"> was the
    receiver and was doubtless the worst and most demoralized character of the whole gang.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His house at South Cerney was used for all sorts
    of stolen property, which he readily got rid of through various channels.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he was a &#145;cadging&#146; butcher
    and a dealer in skins and small lots of wool, gave him opportunities of visiting different
    farms and &#145;taking stock&#146;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    places were then entered by false keys, and property of all descriptions was carried off.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1862 he turned Queen&#146;s Evidence, but in
    spite of this he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">George
    Roseblade</span></strong> <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">was a
    fearless, strong man who did the heavy work of the gang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>He always maintained that his companions cheated him.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would appear that he made better use of his
    money than the others, by taking it home to his wife, and paying off the arrears of his
    club money; he did not mix with the gang at public houses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Having been imprisoned for felony for nine months when caught wit the gang
    in 1862, he confessed, to get the sympathy of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>On the way to Marlborough prison to await trial, he was kept separately from
    the others, but one member, Samuel Price, got a message to him, warning him to be careful,
    as the worst would happen if he gave his companions away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">Two
    members, Messenger and Job Johnsey, threatened Roseblade that he was to expect what would
    follow!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Johnsey and Messenger both determined
    men, had openly declared that if they were interfered with they would murder a policeman,
    or anyone else, burying them on the spot where they fell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">Henry
    Robbins</span></strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none"> was the
    gang&#146;s expert thief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was the maker of
    pick-locks and false keys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had a wife and
    eleven children to keep out of his earnings, but, although he was a common laborer, it was
    a well-known fact that he often spent £1 a week on drink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">He was
    tried at Gloucester Quarter Sessions in 1855 for stealing clover seed, but was acquitted.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1857 found him imprisoned for two months as a
    rogue and vagabond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a cruel husband
    and a bad father, but notwithstanding this, his wife and family appeared to be greatly
    attached to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
    style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">Samuel
    Price</span></strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none"> was the
    only member of the gang (except Henry Johnsey) who could write.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was first and foremost on the nightly thieving
    enterprises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was made paymaster and did
    the distributioin of the money, but it is said that he always managed to take good care of
    himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the Marlborough Quarter Sessions
    he prepared a brief for the defence!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Such dishonest practices had the effect of filling the local
    workhouses with women and children, who otherwise would have had their own cottages to
    live in, leading honest lives.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It is said that at the time of the breaking up, the gang consisted of
    thirteen thieves, eight receivers, fifteen wives and sixty-two children, making a total of
    ninety-eight to be maintained, wither wholly or partially, out of the proceeds of stolen
    property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking the population of the
    village as it was stated in 1862, as about one thousand, there must have been
    approximately a tenth of the inhabitants directly, or indirectly, preying on the
    neighbouring public.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(W &amp; G, 26<sup>th</sup> July 1862; pamphlet
    1862, Bingham Library)</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Mrs Elsie Cole said that her father told her his recollections of
    sheep-stealing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As South Cerney is so near to
    the Wiltshire border it was closely concerned with Wiltshire.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sheep-stealers used to slaughter the sheep and
    hide them in the big box tombs dated 1710-1755 on the south side of the church.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They would wait until night time and then creep
    back when the all clear was given and collect the carcases and then sell the wool and the
    meat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They encouraged tales and fears of
    ghosts to scare people from going through the churchyard at night.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is said that sometimes these men were caught at
    their evil work by local men, and they would be tied into chairs and thrown into the brook
    by the villagers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The warning which the South
    Cerney men used when an official was about was to &#145;Baa&#146; like a sheep.</p>
