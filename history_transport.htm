    <h2>South Cerney Railway Station</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway was authorised by Act of
    Parliament 44 and 45 Vic. Cap, cxlvi, 18<sup>th</sup> July 1881, from a junction with the
    Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway at Rushley Platt, near Swindon, to a junction
    with the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway at Andoversford.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">On 23<sup>rd</sup> June 1884, the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension
    and Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway Companies were amalgamated under the title
    &#145;Midland and South Western Junction Railway Company&#146; by Act 47 &amp; 48 Vic.
    Cap. lxix of the same date.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The line between Rushey Platt and Cirencester, including the station
    at South Cerney, was opened for public traffic on Tuesday, 18<sup>th</sup> December, 1883.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was extended from Cirencester to Andoversford
    on 16<sup>th</sup> March 1891, for goods traffic and on 1<sup>st</sup> August 1891 for
    passenger.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Under the Railways Act 1921 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. V, Ch. 55, 19<sup>th</sup>
    August 1921) the Midland and South Western Junction was absorbed by the Great Western
    Railway as from 1<sup>st</sup> July 1923; actual control by the GWR started on 29<sup>th</sup>
    October 1923.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For administrative purposes,
    the section north of Rushey Platt, on which South Cerney station stands, was taken over by
    the GWR Divisional Superintendent at Gloucester and this arrangement has been continued by
    his successors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Transport Act, 1947 (10
    &amp; 11 Geo. VI Ch. 49, 6<sup>th</sup> August 1947) brought nearly all the railways in
    Great Britain under control of the British Transport Commission as from 1<sup>st</sup>
    January 1948.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The northern part of the former
    M &amp; S W Jc. Rly. was allocated to the Western Region.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">When opened on 18<sup>th</sup> December 1883, the station was named
    &#145;Cerney and Ashton Keynes&#146;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    name has since been changed as follows:-</p>
    <table border="0" width="100%">

        <td width="63%">from 1<sup>st</sup> October 1905 (when the GWR altered the name of their
        Minety station to &#145;Minety &amp; Ashton Keynes&#146;)</td>

      <tr>
        <td width="37%">to Cerney &amp; Ashton Keynes (again)</td>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The station stands almost mid-way between Cirencester (Watermoor) and
    Cricklade stations, 3 miles 12 chains from the former and 3 miles 36 chains from the
    latter (all measured from the centres of the platforms),<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>on a gradient of 1 in 880 falling towards Cricklade.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When opened, the station had only one platform; a
    second platform, passing-loop and signal-box were added in 1891, but I do not appear to
    have the precise date.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">When taken over by the GWR in 1923, the signal-box was 14ft x 12ft
    and had 14 levers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The passing-loop was 1,490
    ft long and the platforms each 258 ft long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    the yard there were 320 feet of sidings, plus a horse-loading dock 67 ft long.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lighting was by oil lamps and water was
    hand-pumped from a well.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The staff at the time consisted of a grade 5 stationmaster (salary
    £210 per year) and two signalmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The total
    revenue in the last three years of the M &amp; SW Co&#146;s existence was:-<br>
    1921<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span
    style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>£5,448
    (Passengers £481, Parcels £273, Goods £4,694)<br>
    1922<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span
    style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>£2,544<br>
    1923<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span
    style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>£2,452</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Traffic consisted of a small quantity of milk (in June 1923 it
    averaged 9 churns a day &#150; 7 to Vauxhall and 2 to Clapham Junction, as compared with
    195 sent from Cricklade each day), general agricultural produce and round timber.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">A leaflet of 1923 of the M &amp; SWJR offers a return fare of 6d
    third class from Cerney station to the Mop Fairs at Cirencester on 8<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>
    October.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On Monday 8yh October, a special
    late train would leave Cirencester at 10.15pm for Cerney, Cricklade and Swindon, but on
    Monday 15<sup>th</sup> the last train to Cerney was the 7.39pm.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Miss W Smith remembers the train times both to Cirencester and
    Swindon as being inconvenient for shopping &#150; trains in about 10am and none back until
    about 4pm.</p>
