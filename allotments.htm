        pathways would take a long time to establish. However should this be put

        quite a lot of new parties expressing interest in taking plots so I 
        think we will fill the site by the end of this year. There is definitely

        Brian and Patricia. Three firms of fencing contractors have visited the 
        site and are preparing estimates to provide suitable fencing and gates 
        to protect the gardens. I have expressed the urgent need for us to have 
        the details/prices so we can apply for funding. Philip is getting on 
        well with the Planning application and says that CDC are being very 
        helpful. Many people including those who are not interested in taking a 
        plot have said how great the hedge clearing work has made the area look. 
        Nobody has seen that lovely wall for decades. Great work and thanks to 
        all who took part. The rotavator is working well after being unpacked 
        and assembled. We are concerned that as it is a big brute it will 
        require to be used by an operator who is pretty strong and fit. We do 
        have someone who we hope will undertake the actual operation but will 
        require payment. When we have full details of how the scheme will work,

        &nbsp;<br>
        Firstly, I m not sure if this should be an email or&nbsp; on the web ?? So I 
        will try both.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Yesterday afternoon I (Pete Brazier, Meadow Way) went for my first visit 
        to the allotment ground (always cycling through the field to get to 
        work, but never ventured around the left hand corner) <br>
        So it was nice to see Pat and Brian Faulkner (of Silver Street) also 
        having a wander. <br>
        We had quite a natter about all things, including moving in to the 
        village over the past couple of years, and how they almost bought the 
        bungalow we moved into. <br>
        We were surprised to see a lovely Cotswold stone wall on the far 
        Southerly side of the ground which is almost lost behind the strangling 
        / leaning over hedgerow etc, and thought <br>
        what about a work party for anyone that was free next Saturday morning 
        at say 9.30, and interested in helping (or even watching) to help cut 
        back / tidy the hedgerow, it would also add quite a bit of&nbsp; width&nbsp; back 
        to the ground. <br>
        Q. If the wind was in the right direction (away from the houses) we 
        wondered if we could have a bonfire and burn away the rubbish as fast as 
        we chopped it down?? <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In a few weeks time we believe we will get the ok, for the land, <br>
        Q. is it not until then that we wish to&nbsp;&nbsp; mark out&nbsp; the plots?? And then 
        we could&nbsp; draw&nbsp; our allocated ground, and make a start, I know we are 
        all very keen.</td>
