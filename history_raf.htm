    <p class="MsoNormal">The building of Royal Air Force South Cerney began in 1936.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In August 1937, No 3 Flying Training School,
    providing advance training for pilots, moved to South Cerney from Grantham, bringing
    Hawker Audax aircraft, which were replaced by Oxfords in 1938.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At the outbreak of war in 1939, Headquarters No 23 Group, which
    controlled advanced pilot training, also moved from Grantham to South Cerney, where it
    remained until October 1946.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile the
    Flying Training School was engaged in a heavy training programme providing experience on
    multi-engined aircraft for newly trained pilots.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth honoured the
    station with a visit on 10<sup>th</sup> February 1940.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>The King inspected the training section, whilst the Queen visited the
    domestic quarters and the WAAF accommodation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later
    in 1940 the Duke of Kent visited the station, and in 1941 the Duchess of Gloucester came
    in her capacity as Chief Commandant of the WAAF.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Queen
    Mary, the Queen Mother, also visited the station in 1941.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1940 the station was amongst the first to be bombed by the
    Luftwaffe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bombs were dropped near the
    airfield in June 1940. a few days after several hundred survivors of Dunkirk had passed
    through the station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Training became
    difficult, as night flying was restricted by the passage of enemy aircraft on bombing
    raids to the Midlands and Merseyside.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">On 14<sup>th</sup> March 1942, the Flying Training School was renamed
    No3 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later in
    the war the unit also provided refresher and acclimatisation training for pilots trained
    overseas. The unit reverted to its designation of No 3 Flying Training School in December
    1945, and in April 1946 moved to Feltwell, being replaced by the Flying Training Command
    Instructors School, which was disbanded in February 1947.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">During the next year the Central Link Trainer School, the Aircrew
    Transit Unit and the Aircrew Allocation Unit were amongst several small units based at
    South Cerney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In March 1948, however, all
    these units were transferred and the station taken over by the No 2 Flying Training
    School, previously at Church Lawford, whose function was to provide basis flying training
    for cadet pilots.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Central Flying School (Basic) was formed at South Cerney in May
    1952, absorbing much of the then disbanded No 2 Flying Training School.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It stayed until May 1957 before moving to Little
    Rissington.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In August 1954 the Central Flying
    School Helicopter Squadron was formed:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
    first unit in the Royal Air Force whose specific task was to provide instruction for
    helicopter pilots.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">No 1 Initial Training School moved from Kirton-in-Lindsay to South
    Cerney on 22<sup>nd</sup> July 1957.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
    function is to give aircrew cadets basic training as officers.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1965 the Primary Flying Squadron was introduced
    to give initial flying to newly-commissioned pilots.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Other activities which have occupied the station from time to time
    include that of being host to Cambridge and Bristol University Air Squadrons and various
    Air Training Corps units for their summer camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    1958 the Royal Air Force Gliding and Soaring Championships were held at South Cerney.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1965 the station played host to the World
    Gliding Championships, which were visited by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
