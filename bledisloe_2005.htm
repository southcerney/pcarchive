      JUDGES’ REPORT</font></b></p>
      <p>Bledisloe Plate 2005 – South Cerney</p>
      <p>Mr Maurice McKee’s report accompanying the entry for the Bledisloe
      Plate was extremely helpful in our attempts to measure the extent of added
      value in South Cerney since the category award last year. As he says,
      “Winning the Bledisloe Cup in 2004 seems to have triggered a marked
      increase in community activity in our village”.<br>
      <br>
      Far from resting on its laurels, the village has powered ahead with a
      remarkable list of new projects to enhance village life – some twenty in
      all. Some of these, such as the new churchyard wall and the interior of
      the Village Hall are immediately apparent. As far as the latter is
      concerned, we were taken on a complete tour of the premises by a man who
      was clearly very proud of the building and its usage. He even showed us
      the bookings diary to demonstrate the point!<br>
      <br>
      Inter alia, we were impressed with the new play equipment at Robert
      Franklin Way play area some of which had been donated by local companies
      and installed by the Parish Council.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned last year, South Cerney is a large village with a wide range
      of socio-economic groupings and a variety of properties, not all of a
      picture postcard nature. This is not, however, to the village’s detriment.
      What emerges strongly during a visit, is the existence of a vibrant and
      active community, working hard to improve the quality of life for everyone
      as well as taking pride in the village’s overall appearance.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, we have pleasure in awarding to:</p>
