    <p align="justify">The Street Fair is an annual event which raises money for 
    many local clubs and charities. Planning for the Street Fair is in full 
    swing to make 2011 as fun as ever. Last year's event was very well attended 
    and it was great to see so many families on fair day. The duck race was once 
    again a particular favourite. Last year we were aware however that there 
    were large numbers of people in Silver Street whilst traffic was trying to 
    get through. We are conscious about safety of those attending the event, 
    particularly at the time of the duck race. To improve safety we are 
    proposing a road closure in Silver Street for 2011.</p>
    <p align="justify">To be granted a road closure we need to apply to the 
    District Council, but, before we do, we would like to receive any comments 
    or suggestions from residents, particularly those affected in Silver Street, 
    Church Lane, School Lane and Bow Wow. We intend to ask for closure between 
    9am - 5pm on the Monday only and to close the road between Timbrells Close 
    and Meadow Way. Please see below for a plan. If you have any comments please 
    email <a href="mailto:streetfair@southcerney.com">streetfair@southcerney.com</a> 
    or letters to The Church Office marked 'Street Fair, Street Closure', by 
    15th January 2011.</p>
    <p align="justify">This is only a proposal at this stage and should we make 
    an application residents are able to contact the District Council directly 
    to make their opinions known.</p>
    <p align="justify">Thank you <br>
    Street Fair Committee</p>
