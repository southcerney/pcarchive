    <p><big><big><strong>Our Charter </strong></big></big></p>
    <p>In 999 King Aethelred II issued two charters rehearsing events that had occurred some
    fifteen years earlier and, no doubt the reason for the charters, clarifying details.</p>
    <p>In 983 Ealdorman Aelfhere of Mercia died. He had, for some years, been probably the
    most important adviser to a succession of Kings and he was a close ally of Aelfthryth,
    Queen Mother of King Aethelred. There is evidence, from charters and wills, that to the,
    no doubt extensive lands already held by the princes of Mercia the grateful monarchs had
    added more.</p>
    <p>On his death he was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Aelfric Cild, and almost at once
    problems arose.</p>
    <p>At a local level, a &quot;noble matron&quot; Eadflaed, who was almost certainly the
    widow of Aelfhere, complained to the King that Aelfric had &quot;violently&quot; seized
    several of her lands including Cerney. (It would have been in accordance with Saxon
    practice for a nobleman like Aelfhere to have sought royal approval when planning the
    disposal of his estates after his death and to have appointed the King as protector of the
    will.)</p>
    <p>At a national level, it was claimed that Aelfric had instigated revolt and turned the
    people of his lands against the King.</p>
    <p>At a Royal Council, held at Cirencester, in 985, the assembled nobles passed judgement
    on the affair. Aelfric was banished for treason and the disputed lands were returned to
    Eadflaed, on condition that at her death they would return to the King and he promised to
    pass them on to the monastery of St Mary's, Abingdon. This did in fact happen and it was
    the almost contemporary chroniclers at the monastery who reported the story. (They also
    lamented the fact that within a few years Archbishop Stigand duped the Abbot into parting
    with the parish, a story confirmed by an inserted entry in Domesday Book.)</p>
    <p>For some reason, perhaps the death of Eadflaed, in 999 two charters were issued
    describing the events outlined above, discussing the perfidy of Aelfric Cild, and, most
    importantly for us describing in detail the boundaries of the &quot;fertile&quot; lands
    and of that &quot;little settlement&quot; of Cerney. Few parishes can have been
    established by such a distinguished cast: King Aethelred II, the Queen Mother Aelfthryth,
    the King's son Athelstan, and one version of the charter adds another son Eadred, the
    Archbishops of both York and Canterbury, ten bishops, four Ealdormen, six Abbots, assorted
    royal kinsmen and ministers.</p>
    <p>Remarkably the boundaries of the parish of Cerney, which incorporates both South Cerney
    and Cerney Wick, have remained unchanged to the present day.</p>
    <p>It can, therefore, be asserted that, whatever went before, the parish of Cerney as
    established by Royal degree, will be celebrating its 1000th birthday in a form not amended
    since the time of the Saxon King Aethelred II.</p>
    <p><big><big><strong>Our History </strong></big></big></p>
    <p>Throughout the millennia of pre-history our early ancestors, hunters, gatherers and
    eventually farmers, left evidence of their presence in our parish. By Saxon times there
    was a small settlement in Cerney and 1000 years ago, in the reign of King Aethelred II, as
    has already been described, the parish boundaries were defined. They, and the church that
    followed soon after, have survived to the verge of the new millennium.<O:P /></p>
    <p>The entries in Domesday Book, and the records of the church authorities, the great
    monastic houses which partly owned the village and the church, and occasionally the
    records of tax collectors provide us with increasingly frequent glimpses of the growth and
    development of medieval Cerney and Cerney Wick. </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2">Indeed for a time, from 950 - 1150, the parish was of great
    importance because of its strategic location at the southern tip of the Cotswolds and also
    because of the richness of the soil and the lush meadows. Great lords sought to control
    the parish: Ealdormen of Mercia, Archbishop Stigand and successive Earls of Hereford. The
    destruction of Cerney castle in 1139, the triumph of King Stephen, and the succession of
    Henry II, effectively ended the political role of the parish.</p>
    <p>The break-up of the manor followed and the parish was shared between the Priory of
    Lanthony Secunda at Gloucester, the Abbey of St.Augustine at Bristol and the St. Amand
    family. Despite the division the village grew and flourished. The records show that its
    population increased, agriculture flourished and the presence of a fulling mill, weavers,
    textile workers and dyers suggests a significant woollen and cloth industry in the 14th
    century. After the dissolution of the monasteries and with the fading of the St. Amand
    line, new owners broke up the estates and sold off much of the land.<O:P /> </p>
    <p>The result was a rash of house building in the 16th and 17th centuries: Upper Up,
    Silver Street Station Road and the High Street, Church and School Lanes and much of Cerney
    Wick are all from this time. The economic base for this was undoubtedly agriculture and
    the richness of the meadows and water meadows were a source of widespread comment. The
    coming of the canal and its wharves and, almost a century later in 1884, of the railway
    only served to encourage the growth of the village, increasingly a source of labour as
    well as goods and produce for the surrounding area. The census returns of the nineteenth
    century reveal a village of around a thousand people at first working in the parish, but
    later many travelling to Cirencester and Swindon. </p>
    <p>The last century has seen dramatic change. The railway has gone, gravel extraction has
    come and the canal, closed in the 1920's, is due for a new lease of life. The parish is
    now separated by man-made lakes, the Water Park, home to a growing leisure industry. New
    housing has proliferated and surrounds the historic centre of the village. The airfield
    was established in 1936 and served as an important training base for RAF personnel up to
    about 1970 when it was transferred to the Army as the Duke of Gloucester Barracks. An
    industrial estate along Broadway Lane has expanded rapidly and the village population has
    doubled in the past twenty years to over 3000. </p>
    <p>Now 1000 years after our Charter, 900 years after Domesday and three times larger than
    the Victorian village we have made another attempt to take stock of where and what we are
    - and where we want to go and what we want for our successors in this large, vital and
    historically important community. Domesday was a result of questions asked of local
    people. Our appraisal follows the precedent. Domesday reported on what had been and what
    was. Our appraisal asks what is and what might be.</p>
    <p>In its own way the appraisal is every bit as remarkable as the earlier enquiries. That
    it was accomplished in such a large community is a great tribute to the hard work of a
    handful of dedicated individuals and to the community spirit and participation of the
    whole parish. To suggest the report can guide us through the next 1000 years might be
    optimistic, but it surely provides a beacon to guide us into the next millennium.</td>
