      <p><font FACE="Times New Roman"><b><u>Large
      Village: </u>SOUTH CERNEY</b></p>
      </font>
      <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><p>I last saw South Cerney in 2001, when it
      won the Bledisloe Cup in the large village class. It is as good as ever,
      if not better.</p>
      <p>The village is large (3,500 people) and has a wide range of housing
      development, not all of it is 'picture postcard Cotswolds' at all. Parts
      of it feel more urban than village-like, but around the older part it
      retains a strong village feeling with much historic character. What <i>all
      </i>parts of South Cerney have however is a feeling of being cared for. It
      matters so much that the whole village - not just the conventionally
      pretty bits - is well looked after. This must reflect a strong community
      spirit.</p>
      <p>I liked many things about the village, many of which were well
      documented in the report and identified on the map:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The playing fields at Upper Up, which last time sported a fair
        collection of litter, were impeccable. The new disabled access is
        welcome and so too is the winding path that leads to the pond: with its
        wildflowers, darting dragonflies and flitting house martins, this area
        is a great addition to the village;</li>
        <li>The war memorial is now in good heart after the repair of past
        damage to the railings, and the pavements around the nearby shops and
        school - usually a focus for litter - were spotlessly clean;</li>
        <li>The new housing at the Limes looks out upon a very well tended
        green, and there is more of this to be seen at the Piece, with its wild
        flowers growing happily in the ditches;</li>
        <li>The new children's playing area at Robert Franklin Way was being
        well used by mums and children - it would be the envy of many other
        communities;</li>
        <li>The churchyard and the thriving allotments are a tribute to the care
        lavished upon these areas - South Cerney must keep its allotments. Some
        good new gates have been erected on the footpath leading east from the
        church, and I hope the kissing gate to the churchyard will soon be
        reinstated as well;</li>
        <li>Bow Wow a wonderfully cared for walk - green, cool and watery; it is
        completely un-municipal in feeling, yet very popular. All the other
        footpaths 1 saw were also in good condition;</li>
        <li>The village hall is a design winner, and is now improved through the
        provision of disabled access to the rear;</li>
        <li>The notice boards are good — especially the use of a good village
        map, an idea that more villages should adopt;</li>
        <li>All the shops, restaurants, pubs and other economic ventures - even
        a small factory belonging to the Mitie Group - respect their setting;</li>
        <li>And finally there are dozens of delightful gardens that spill out on
        to the lanes, footpaths and river Churn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I found nothing that disappointed, except that I did not see the
      litter-picking dog I had read about! She (and her owner) have done a great
      job - and South Cerney has done itself proud.</p>

      <p>Acknowledgements</p>
      </u></font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
      <p>My thanks to Margaret Boakes for her efficient organisation of the
      Bledisloe Cup for 2004. She has done an admirable job, taking over
      smoothly from Graham Stockham who had indeed set a very high standard. And
      thanks, too, to the many judges who assessed the entries at an earlier
      stage. Their detailed and conscientious analyses were very helpful in
      preparation for my inspections and in the field.</p>
      <u><b>
      <p>General remarks</p>
      </b></u>
      <p>As always, judging the Bledisloe Cup was fascinating and difficult.
      Maybe this year it was more challenging than usual because of the very
      different kinds of villages that made it to the final: three from the
      Cotswolds, one from the Vale of Gloucester and two from the Forest of Dean
      area.</p>
      <p>Villages have been judged against the agreed criteria: these can be
      summed up in the answer to the question: 'what community has done the most
      to bring added value to the village environment?' and not - of course -
      'what village looks prettiest?' I have tried to take into account that
      some villages have a much tougher challenge than others, but at the same
      time, one can only judge by results.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, all three winners this year are Cotswold villages, but
      all the others were impressive runners up. It is really important that
      they keep trying — who knows, with a little more effort next year all
      three Bledisloe winners may come from the Vale and Forest of Dean parts of
      Gloucestershire.</p>
      <u><b>
      <p>Final Results</p>
      </b></u>
      <p>I recommend that the following villages should be the winners of the
      Bledisloe Cup for 2004:</p>
      <b>
      <ul>
        <li>Large Village: South Cerney</li>
        <li>Medium-sized Village: Somerford Keynes</li>
        <li>Small Village: Cold Aston</li>
      </ul>
