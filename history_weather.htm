    <h2>Flood Hatches</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Mrs Jack Painter said the hatches ceased to be used regularly from
    1935 onwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1965 two poles were placed one above the other lying across the
    weir to keep the level of the mill stream up when there were the floods the week before
    Christmas, 1965.</p>
    <h2>Floods</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1927 the river flooded the village in November and December.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The water was across the road at Upper Up, and
    down the High Street and also Station Road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    was over gum-boot level in the week before Christmas, and it was across the whole of
    School Lane.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><u>1965-66 Floods <o:p></o:p></u></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Water was out across School Lane and Bow Wow during weeks December 13<sup>th</sup>
    to January 3<sup>rd</sup>, and also across Kemble Road immediately around the Upper Up
    corner for 20 yards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A plank walk was put
    down past Highnam Cottages, and down Bow Wow we got up onto the mill stream bank.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In Cerney Wick the water was running 6 inches deep all along the road
    from Cerney into Wick after the S bend to the mill corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>My family and I bicycled through it and had to keep going hard to get
    through.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Outside Chapter Manor stable gates the water was all through the
    cottage garden and standing inside the cottage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
    had cut many channels down the bank between the mill stream and main stream, but not taken
    out the boards below the hatches; the Thames Conservancy man told me this had spread the
    floods instead of guiding the water over the weir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About
    January 4<sup>th</sup> he told me he was opening all the hatches to get the water out past
    Cerney and it would flood more at Wick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon
    after this the water subsided.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">There was almost no frost at this time.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Frost and snow came January 10<sup>th</sup>
    onwards, when the wind went east.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
    sunny mild weather with the floods, very attractive.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(Mrs A M Hadfield)</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><u>Hailstorm, July 13<sup>th</sup> 1967</u></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At 7.30 pm the sky was very dark, and slight rain fell.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By 8.30 the rain was very violent and fell
    &#145;in buckets&#146;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At 8.45 hail fell
    very densely, rattling down the chimney onto the hearth, and covering the ground outside.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The hail stones were the size of golf balls and
    they fell for ten minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A large number of
    cold frame lights and greenhouse panes were broken; by 9.30 pm the storm was over.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(Mrs A M Hadfield)</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><u>Hailstorm, 7<sup>th</sup> July 1896<o:p></o:p></u></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">On this evening the worst storm took place in living memory.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hail stones of phenomenal size appeared and in
    places were several inches deep, and they were still lying at 10 am the next morning.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs White, at The Limes, had 70-80 panes broken in
    her greenhouse, as did many other people in South Cerney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Mr Joseph Varney had all his corn crop destroyed, which was not insured.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the storm he was milking a cow, and his pet
    gosling came to him for protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately
    a flash of lightening struck the milk bucket, overturning it and killing his pet gosling.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several sheep belonging to Mr Robert Smith of
    Cerney Wick were blinded during the storm, and after the storm he had to carry bucketsful
    of water out of his house.</p>

    <h2>Water Shortage</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Report by the Cirencester RDC:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>due
    to an acute water shortage the water cress beds at Boxwell Springs, South Cerney, are
    almost dry, and all the levels of the artesian wells in the district are down.</p>
