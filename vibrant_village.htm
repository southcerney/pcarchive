    <p align="justify">The judges were impressed by the community spirit 
    demonstrated in such a large village. The way in which the churches worked 
    together was of particular note. The village's choice of Village Hall and 
    Reform Church as their best facility seemed well founded and the way they 
    worked in concord meant that had to be listed jointly.</p>
    <p align="justify">The project which impressed was the creation of a new 
    allotment from scratch. Once the negotiations to obtain the use of a site 
    had been completed, great efforts on the part of the new allotment holders 
    meant that the site is in almost full production after only a matter of 
    weeks.</p>
    <p align="justify">The needs of young people in the village are always taken 
    into account and they have an active youth parish council in place. Young 
    people played a part in the design of the play area which is a fine facility 
    which the young people value.</p>
    <p align="justify">South Cerney also shows itself as a caring community, 
    both locally in its support for victims of violence and outside the UK with 
    the aid it supplies to the victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka.</p>
