        <td width="55%"><p align="justify">This is a brief insight into a very 
        different father in law.</p>
        <p align="justify">I met Geoff in the early 1980’s at his house in 
        School Lane when I was first going out with Sue. It was a slightly 
        unusual meeting by any standards as Geoff was taking a bath in the rain 
        water butt in the garden where he had pumped water through a black hose 
        pipe laid in the sun to warm the water. I was to learn that Geoff was 
        the Ultimate environmentalist without knowing it and he hated putting 
        the gas heating and hot water on and was always very careful with his 
        use of water, and when he took a conventional bath he would collect the 
        water from bath, feed into washing machine, then collect waste water 
        from washing machine to wash floors and then water the vegetables. In 
        later years Thames Water fitted a water meter and they returned numerous 
        times as they did not believe how little water was used. This was my 
        first experience of his dislike of giving money to utility companies.

      <tr>
        <td width="100%" colspan="2"><p align="justify">It always impressed me 
        that Geoff built the house in School Lane on his own using all the stone 
        from the old cottages that he demolished, and making all the roof tiles 
        and large corner stones by hand with his home made formers and a 
        vibrating machine made up from a singer treadle sewing machine and a 
        roller skate.</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff was either on the allotment, in the barn or in 
        the churchyard digging a grave and you could generally find him by 
        locating his white bike. He was always on this bike which had no brakes 
        and a clothes peg holding it in third gear which he could change into a 
        lower gear by taking the peg off, but as this was beside the back wheel 
        it took quite a bit of skill when in motion, and he usually had an 
        extension ladder under one arm with a bucket of tools on the handle 
        bars. The only time I recall him coming off was in the early hours after 
        an extended single malt session in the Eliot.</p>
        <p align="justify">Sue and I married in 1990 where Geoff’s advice to Sue 
        as he walked her to the church was &quot;ere our Suze, its not too late to 
        call it off&quot; I was never quite sure that he approved of a future son in 
        law that made a living sitting down in front of a computer.</p>
        <p align="justify">Sue and I later moved into the other house that Geoff 
        built in Meadow Way where we started the task of clearing it out and 
        finishing it off. Geoff had turned the house and barn into his very own 
        South Cerney recycling facility and had managed to fill every room of 
        the house with various bits and pieces over the years. We had to 
        negotiate for the removal of his collection of 20 odd toilets in the 
        bedrooms, bathroom suites in the dining room, dozens of doors, a few old 
        kitchens, and there was the Morris Oxford in the lounge which was 
        eventually moved to the garden to join the other Morris Oxford which was 
        on the patio together with a Rover, Austin A35, two Metros, two cement 
        mixers and collection of old bikes which were all going to come in 
        useful one day.</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff was very generous until it came to giving money 
        to utility companies and so it was with Thames Water and his response to 
        an extortionate quote for a water connection was to get out the spade 
        and say, come on Patrick you’re going to dig a well. The Equipment 
        consisted of some 4 foot concrete rings which appeared from somewhere, a 
        spade, a bucket and two ropes one for me as a safety measure just in 
        case the sides came in, which he told me at around 12 foot down, and one 
        to lift the bucket up and down, I was never really sure if he would have 
        lifted me out before his bucket in the event of collapse.</p>
        <p align="justify">As you will all know Geoff dug the majority of the 
        graves in the last few decades not hanging up his spade until he was in 
        his late 70's, they were all dug by hand and in the early days he would 
        dig the grave the same day as the funeral, get changed to help carry the 
        coffin and then fill in afterwards. It will probably surprise you to 
        learn that one of his last wishes was to be cremated, as he put it - he 
        had spent too long down holes in that churchyard.</p>
        <p align="justify">He died at home with Julie and Suzie at his side and 
        he would have been very proud that on the night he died they were able 
        to dress him in his suit and sit with him taking a tipple of one of his 
        favourite single malt whiskies which is exactly the way Geoff would have 
        wanted. As Geoff put it when he was trying to tell sue of the death of a 
        relative – He’s called it a day, Thrown in the towel, gone gently 
        on…………South Cerney has certainly lost a great character.</p>
        <hr><p align="center"><b><font size="4">Talk by Rev. David Bowers. Vicar 
        of South Cerney</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff was born in 1929 and spent his early years 
        living with his mum, dad and sister Ruby in Siddington. Geoff’s dad was 
        a cobbler who had a shop in Cricklade Street, Cirencester. Sometimes, if 
        his dad was working late, Geoff would go on his bike and take his dad a 
        hot meal. This meant going through Watermoor and the local lads took 
        great delight in dropping things from the railway bridge as Geoff cycled 
        by. It meant going as fast as Geoff could, dodging the missiles and 
        trying not to spill his dad’s tea.</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff ‘s first job was with his donkey, which he took 
        to the local railway station to collect passengers and luggage and took 
        to their destination in his cart At 14, towards the end of WW2, Geoff 
        left school and started work at a goat farm in Ewen, run by 2 old 
        ladies. He did very well for himself there as eventually the ladies left 
        most of the work to him and by the late 1940’s Geoff earned £1 a day 
        which was excellent money for a 20 year old. It was about this time that 
        the family moved to South Cerney. </p>
        <p align="justify">This hard earned money enabled Geoff to develop his 
        love of motor cycles and he soon replaced his ex WD Royal with a new 
        Matchless which he used on the road and also he raced on it at tracks 
        like Thruxton. Never one to boast about his exploits but a programme for 
        Thruxton in the mid 50’s listed 2 guest riders, Geoff Duke, who was 
        500cc World Champion, and Geoff Andrews!</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff was a member of the Cirencester Motor Cycle 
        club and at the annual gymkhana his party trick was to jump his 
        Matchless through huge panes of glass to the delight of the crowd. 
        Health &amp; Safety concerns were different in those days.</p>
        <p align="justify">He hated holidays much preferring to spend his time 
        chatting with his friends whilst working on the motorbikes putting them 
        right.</p>
        <p align="justify">Then Geoff met Jean - Jean loved dancing so racing 
        took a back seat and Saturday night dances took over. They would travel, 
        on his motor bike, to the local village halls, and Geoff would sample 
        the local ale whilst Jean danced the night away.</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff and Jean married in the late 50’s and took over 
        The Old George public house. Jean would look after the pub, most days, 
        whilst Geoff took on some extra work such as grave digging and water 
        bailiff, and then they would both run the George in the evenings. Geoff 
        went into building work and in the late 60’s bought a plot of land in 
        Fairford and a derelict cottage in School Lane, South Cerney. In his 
        spare time, Geoff built a house in Fairford which he sold to fund the 
        building of a family home in School Lane. It turned out to be a perfect 
        location with an allotment next door and both the pub and church within 
        walking distance.</p>
        <p align="justify">Although life sounded quite idyllic, there was a 
        great sadness as Jean developed dementia at a very early age. Geoff 
        cared for her at home and nursed her up to her death.</p>
        <p align="justify">After this period, Geoff re-kindled his interest in 
        motor cycle racing mainly going to watch road racing, at the circuits 
        that he raced at, Thruxton, Silverstone etc., and occasional scrambles. 
        He loved classical music and radio 3 was always on either at the house 
        or in the churchyard whilst digging a grave. He was a friend to many 
        people in the village helping with tasks ranging from mending broken 
        drainpipes to keeping the Arnhem veterans graves tidy at Down Ampney.</p>
        <p align="justify">He enjoyed countless tea breaks with his friends in 
        the village talking about anything and everything. Subjects included 
        potato blight, 18th century music, damned dogs!, European politics and 
        many others…</p>
        <p align="justify">A proud moment in his life was when he received the 
        Maundy money from the Queen at Gloucester Cathedral in 2003, the 
        absolute delight at receiving an invitation from Clarence House!!</p>
        <p align="justify">I know that everyone will have their own personal 
        memory or tale to tell of Geoff and as so many of the lovely cards that 
        the family have received say&nbsp; “He was a true gentle, gentleman”</p>

        <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Talk by Rev. John Calvert. Vicar 
        of South Cerney until 2007</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify">I am very sad that I am not well enough to be with 
        you today to share in this celebration of Geoff’s life. I had been so 
        looking forward to reminiscing about his life and my working 
        relationship with him. So, this electronically ‘penned’ missive will 
        have to do. This is not a eulogy – merely my thoughts on Geoff. There 
        are many aspects of his life that can be better covered by others.</p>

          <tr>
            <td width="54%" valign="top">
            <p align="justify">A year after I retired I attended a Vaughan 
            Williams memorial concert at Down Ampney and, by coincidence, Geoff 
            turned up in his van to dig a grave. We had a little chat and then I 
            said: ‘I’ve got my camera here so can I take your photograph?’ Geoff 
            slewed round in his seat and looked at the camera. What I took 
            epitomised Geoff. Ruddy complexion, cap, braces, a little rough 
            round the edges, a man of the soil (very much so as a gravedigger), 
            comfortable in the surroundings of his rather dilapidated van. It is 
            picture I shall continue to treasure because he was such a unique 
            person.</p>
            <p align="justify">In my 20 years as Vicar of South Cerney I got to 
            know Geoff well. Not that we socialised but we had plenty of chats 
            to put the world aright over a half-dug grave. He was in the true 
            sense of the word, a colleague. We both had a mutual task – to care 
            both for the dead and for the living, so that everything at that 
            Funeral hour would be perfect. </td>

        </table>
        <p align="justify">Geoff did not just dig the graves, he was my 
        right-hand man in terms of who was buried where – and in this respect he 
        was a fount of knowledge. ‘Do you think anyone else could be in here’ I 
        would ask. ‘I’ll have a dig around and let you know’, would be the 
        reply. ‘Can we get another grave in Cerney Wick?’ was a question raised 
        over the years. Geoff would have a chat with villagers, investigate and 
        say, to my surprise, ‘Yes, we can.’</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff, despite his relatively slight build, was 
        tough. I certainly couldn’t have done what he did in the short time he 
        had to dig a grave. But he was tough in another sense – and that was in 
        caring for Jean, his wife, struck down with Alzheimer’s in her 50s. 
        There was no fuss, no histrionics, Geoff just quietly got on with the 
        job of supporting and caring for Jean. It must have been a very hard 
        time and he would certainly have valued the support of Sue and Julie.</p>
        <p align="justify">Geoff was a person of routine – every Sunday evening, 
        for instance, he and Jean would sit in the south aisle at Evensong. 
        After Jean’s death Geoff was still there every Sunday – a solid, 
        dependable member of All Hallows. However, he was also a man of 
        surprises! One evening I went to a meeting of the Cirencester Gramophone 
        Society and, low and behold, Geoff was there, smartly dressed. I learned 
        that he had a great interest in classical music and was a regular 
        member. I wonder what other surprises he had in store for people who got 
        to know him?</p>
        <p align="justify">One of the great pleasures I had was in recommending 
        Geoff to receive the Royal Maundy money when the Queen attended 
        Gloucester Cathedral. Didn’t he look smart in his suit! I hope the 
        photograph of him holding the money is on show today.</p>
        <p align="justify">Why did I put Geoff’s name forward? Because Geoff was 
        one of Gloucestershire’s unsung heroes, going about essential work 
        quietly and unobtrusively. Giving a lot to the community in which he 
        lived and breathed, without fuss. It was time to make a fuss of him.</p>
        <p align="justify">I hope this service also makes a fuss of him. He gave 
        much in the service of this village church and this village community. 
        We place him in God’s loving arms at the end of a worthwhile life of 
        service to God and South Cerney. God bless him.</p>
