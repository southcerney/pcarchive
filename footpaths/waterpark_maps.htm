    <p><strong>To get sufficient detail our map has to be large, therefore we offer you here
    the map in three different sizes.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The big size has a width of 2,000 pixels and gives the most clear details, but
    its size is 374 KB so it will take a little while to download. You will then have to
    scroll the screen both sideways and up and down to find what you want. This is best if you
    want to save the map, and print it scaled to your printer's width.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The middle size has a width of 1,250 pixels and gives fairly clear details. Its
    size is 172 KB and you will probably still have to do some scrolling, but not so much.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The small size has a width of 750 pixels and its size is only 72 KB. This won't
    take so long to download and may well fit across the width of your screen so that you only
    need to scroll up and down, however it is not so clear and you may have difficulty reading
    the names and lake numbers.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>All maps open in their own window on your screen, so when finished just close
    that window and you will come back to here again.</strong></p>
