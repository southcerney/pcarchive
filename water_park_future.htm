    <p align="center"><b>Residents to have say in Cotswold Water Park's future</b></p>
    </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p>People living within the Cotswold Water Park are being invited to comment 
    on plans for its future during a six-week public consultation.</p>
    <p>Commissioned by the Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee, which is made up 
    of the five local authorities with responsibility for the area, together 
    with the Cotswold Water Park Society, the plans set out a long-term 
    strategic vision for the development of the area over the next 20 years.</p>
    <p>As well as residents, all those interested in having a say in the area's 
    future are being asked to visit the Cotswold Water Park Society's website (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.waterpark.org/">www.waterpark.org</a>) 
    where there is an on-line survey to capture residents' opinions and 
    feedback.</p>
    <p>&quot;This consultation is an exciting opportunity for residents to shape the 
    future of their neighbourhood,&quot; commented Dennis Grant, chief executive of 
    the Cotswold Water Park Society. &quot;I'd encourage anyone interested in the 
    future of this area to visit the website and give us their views on our 
    plans.</p>
    <p>&quot;The vision for the future includes a number of exciting proposals which 
    we believe will significantly benefit both local residents and visitors. 
    However, we're keen to ensure that local residents have the opportunity to 
    review and comment on our plans, which is why we have launched this 
    consultation.&quot;</p>
    <p>Suggestions up for debate include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;'conservation corridor' from near Kemble to Lechlade, linking a 
      number of significant nature reserves and conservation-based visitor 
      attractions</li>
      <li>a a water sports complex to Include an Olympic size rowing course that 
      could host regional competitions and offer training opportunities as well 
      as provide a venue for local events such as dragon boat racing</li>
      <li>a national angling centre to support what is already a major sport in 
      the area and build on existing water sports and tourism facilities</li>
      <li>eco-friendly, family orientated and water related leisure developments</li>
      <li>diversification of existing agricultural land to provide potential for 
      the growth of biomass fuels, provision of tourist accommodation or 
      increased sustainable farming</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under the plans, local residents will also benefit from an integrated 
    network of recreational routes, including footpaths, cycle paths, bridleways 
    and towpaths. There are also plans for a water taxi to travel along the 
    Thames and Seven Canal and North Wiltshire Canal. These will provide 
    opportunities for sustainable travel between the numerous towns and villages 
    within the Cotswold Water Park, allowing residents and visitors to explore 
    the area.</p>
    <p>Councillor Shaun Parsons, chair of the Joint Committee representing the 
    relevant local Councils added: &quot;We believe that there is a real need for a 
    soundly planned future for the environment of the Cotswold Water Park. We 
    want people living in towns such as Fairford, Lechlade and Cricklade and 
    villages like South Cerney and Ashton Keynes to benefit from both the 
    conservation proposals and leisure and recreational opportunities provided 
    by such development opportunities and for the local economy to see 
    significant gains from increased visitor interest.&quot;</p>
    <p>In addition to the online survey, a number of workshops are being held 
    with government and non-government agencies and other organisations with a 
    stake in the park such as landowners, mineral operators and those 
    responsible for the recreational facilities.</p>

    Comments can be made via the online consultation until the 7 March 2008.</p>

    <p><b>Notes to editors<br>
    The Cotswold Water Park<br>
    </b>Established in 1967, Cotswold Water Park (CWP) covers an area of 40 
    square miles of lakes and gravel workings around the upper reaches of the 
    River Thames.</p>
    <p>The CWP is managed by a Joint Committee made up of the five local 
    authorities with responsibility for the area - Wiltshire and Gloucestershire 
    County Councils, Cotswold, Swindon and North Wilts District Councils 
    together with the Cotswold Water Park Society.</p>
    <p>In 2006 the Joint Committee commissioned a strategic review to guide the 
    future development of the Park based on a clear, robust and evidence based 
    framework for delivering an achievable vision. The plan currently available 
    for consultation is part of this strategic review.</p>
    <p>More information on the CWP can be found at
