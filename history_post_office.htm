    <h2>Postmaster</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Arthur Johnson became postmaster about 1898, succeeding his
    father, Mr John Johnson, who was himself born in the village.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before that Mr Arthur Johnson had been apprenticed
    to Fielding and Platt at Gloucester as an engineer, and had subsequently travelled abroad,
    including Ohio in the USA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When his father
    fell ill, he returned home, and on his father&#146;s death took over the office.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Johnson died in 1933, and was succeeded by his widow, Mrs Johnson.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Miss Grace Johnson, the present postmistress is
    their daughter.</p>
    <h2>The Mails</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In Mr John Johnson&#146;s time the mails were brought on foot from
    Cirencester by Mr Shipway, a Cirencester man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    also delivered and collected letters in the village before walking back, all in the
    morning.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Later, and lasting at least until the 1920s, they came in a trailer
    behind a bicycle, and were delivered by the postman using a cycle with a big tray in front
    to carry the bag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Cirencester postman
    also cleared the boxes and took the mails back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
    about two years during this first World War, and due to manpower shortage, Mr Johnson and
    his family cleared the letter boxes at Dry Leaze, the Vicarage wall, The Horse &amp;
    Groom, Siddington turn (beyond the aerodrome towards Cirencester) and towards Preston, and
    tool the mails into Cirencester.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs Johnson
    remembers, it seemed always to be wet as a result of clearing the boxes every day.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Later, again as the quantity of mail increased, it was sent out from
    Cirencester by train to the station, where some of the Johnson family collected it about 6
    am off the train, bought it to the office, sorted it, and delivered to part of the
    village, while a postman from Cirencester delivered to the rest.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Outgoing mail was taken back to Cirencester by
    this man on his bicycle.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The second delivery was instituted about 1930.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">About 1935 the mail ceased to come by train and was brought by motor
    van.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About this time, too, sorting began to
    be done in Cirencester instead of at the South Cerney office.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Postmarking of outgoing letters at the office with the South Cerney
    postmark ceased about 1960.</p>
    <h2>The Telegraph</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Until the telegraph reached the village in 1925, and telegrams began
    to be telephoned, the post office had a telegraph instrument.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was an ABC instrument, on which a letter key
    was depressed and a handle turned after each letter; this indicated the same letter on the
    instrument at the Cirencester end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Note: the
    earliest such machine was separately introduced by Sir Charles Wheatstone, 1802-75, and
    Sir William Cooke, 1802-75, the latter&#146;s machine appearing in 1840. The post office
    type was probable the later Siemens pattern.)</p>
    <h2>The Telephone</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">There were no telephones in South Cerney until the manual exchange
    was introduced with eight initial subscribers on 29 June 1925.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was placed at the Post Office.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The original subscribers were:<br>
