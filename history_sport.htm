    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">One of the oldest known organised sports of the village is football.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first team was formed about 1900 and was one
    of the first clubs to enter the Cirencester and District League which was formed in 1920
    and they still compete in this competition as well as entering the Cirencester Charities
    Cup, the Arthur Shipway Cup and the County Cup.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    fortunes of the club have varied considerably over the years, the peak period being after
    the 1939-45 war when as many as four teams were fielded, but as the years passed the
    interest dwindled and there was difficulty at times to find players to form one team.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The club can count among its successes the winning of the Cirencester
    Hospital Cup on two occasions, the County Cup and being League Champions on more than one
    occasion.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(1966)</em></p>
    <h2>Cricket</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Cricket has also been played in the village for many years and was
    well supported for many years but suffered the same fate as football and eventually it was
    found impossible to field a team.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Through the enthusiasm of a few lovers of the game it was restarted
    in 1966.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ground is the school ground off
    High Street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The club build their own
    pavilion in 1967.</p>
    <h2>Bowls</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">A bowling green situated in the &#147;Downings&#148; consisting of
    three rinks was the headquarters of the South Cerney Bowling Club.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was in great demand over many years and
    brought a great deal of pleasure to older members of the community.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate that this once very active club
    is no longer in being.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr Cantrell provided
    the land from 1925 or so to 1938 or so.</p>
    <h2>Tennis</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">By kind permission of Capt Cripps who offered the use of his hard
    court at Atkyns Manor to interested players, it was possible to form a club.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This provided entertainment for a great many and
    included tournament and match play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1930&#146;s
    and post-war.</p>
    <h2>Indoor Activities</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">A Rifle Club has been in existence for many years, the range being at
    the rear of the Post Office.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Among other indoor sports are Skittles, Cribbage and Darts team, all
    of which compete in the local leagues.</p>
    <h2>Water Sports<o:p></o:p></h2>
    <p>The Angling Club <span style="FONT-STYLE: normal">whose membership is approximately 250
    is the oldest of the water sports which has been in existence for some 30 years.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They fish some 250 acres of water in the pits as
    well as about 7 miles of river.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fish
    include trout, roach, perch, pike, chub and carp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most
    of these waters have been stocked by the club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Members
    have fished in the All England Championships (1967). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal">A Good Catch was recorded in July 1908, when Mr A H
    Williams of South Cerney caught a fine trout weighing 3lb 9oz. In the river Churn at South
    Cerney Mill<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(W &amp; G 1908)</em></p>

    Committee for youth training.</p>
    <h2>Quoits</h2>
