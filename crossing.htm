    <p><font size="2">Traffic surveys have been undertaken by Gloucestershire 
    Highways in response to the proposal for a pedestrian crossing in the High 
    Street. The results of the surveys are to be discussed at the next Parish 
    Council meeting, on Wednesday 14th March. A representative of 
    Gloucestershire County Council will attend that meeting. The following is a 
    summary of Gloucestershire Highways’ initial report to the Parish Council:-</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In October 2006 pedestrian crossing counts were carried 
    out along High Street and Broadway Lane, and vehicle speeds and volumes 
    assessed at the War Memorial and The Old Cross junctions. The pedestrian 
    counts illustrated a low number of people crossing during the 12 hour period 
    07:00 – 19:00. Those that were crossing did so sporadically, and not at one 
    particular point. Gloucestershire Highways believes that these findings 
    present a problem in justifying a crossing in the High Street.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Over the years Gloucestershire County Council have noted 
    that pedestrians will not go out of their way to use a crossing. There are 
    examples of this across the County, for instance at Churchdown, where a 
    puffin crossing was provided for an average of 400 users, and yet it is 
    still seen by many as under-used. The South Cerney survey indicated just 150 
    users.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Furthermore, traffic volume and speeds along High Street 
    are such that Gloucestershire Highways believes there is little 
    justification for traffic calming, or evidence to suggest that traffic 
    conditions make it difficult for people to cross the road. Its Road Safety 
    and Accident Investigation officers have undertaken a site visit, to go 
    through the surveys and view the pedestrian movement and traffic flows. Ann 
    Edwards School has recently recruited a School Crossing Patrol to operate in 
    the mornings, on the High Street, and this will address the issue to a 
    significant extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Gloucestershire Highways has concluded that there is no 
    data to evidence a significant safety problem in the High Street. There are 
    many stretches of road across the County that have a worse accident record, 
    and they believe that those should take priority.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Another matter is the question of possible traffic calming 
    in Silver Street, by the Post Office. Pedestrians, particularly the elderly, 
    going to the Post Office and the Church find it difficult to cross due to 
    the humped-back bridge to the north which obscures their view of oncoming 
    vehicles. The possibility of a built-out curb outside the Post Office, to 
    slow traffic speeds and to assist those crossing, is being considered. 
    Gloucestershire Highways believes that such a scheme has some merit, and 
    could potentially be prioritised for GCC funding. It is something that it 
    will be happy to discuss further at the meeting on 14th March.</font></p>
