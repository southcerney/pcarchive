        <td width="80%">The trucks, upon leaving the gravel pits, should be
        sprayed with water to remove dust/mud from them. They have a certain
        amount of responsibility to keep the roads clean. However as the region
        is agriculturally active - in autumn a lot of mud comes from tractors
        out planting/ploughing etc. The heavy traffic from locals and tourists
        also creates problems, as does muddy water run-off from fields. decaying
        leaves also provide a very slippery material. It's often difficult for
        the source of 'mud' to be tracked down, and therefore the liability.
        Speak to the CDC, they'll inform you about liability, and the companies
        responsibilities - but generally they do what they're meant to.</td>

        <td width="80%">I know, it's autumn, it's busy, it's wet, there's a lot
        of industry etc. But several visiting friends have recently commented
        that leaving the amount of mud and dirt on this road (and pavements)
        that the trucks continually do is probably illegal - on the part of the
        companies who create the mess. I would have though it was also of
        considerable concern, in view of the desired upward trend in the
        leisure/tourist aspects, that this is the dirtiest, muddiest, possibly
        slipperiest road in the area.</td>
