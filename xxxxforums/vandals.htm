        planted shrubbs at Silver Street/Northmoor Lane can only be described as
        mindless vandelism carried out by idiots who have no respect for others
        or the village in which they reside. If anybody saw this wanton act then
        tell the police.</td>

        everything except for the damage to our cars. We have to park one of our cars in the high
        street, and the other is parked on, we believe an area put aside for the parking of one of
        our cars.This we were led to believe by the previous owners of our property. So far we
        have had one broken wing mirror, last month someone obviously hit our car in the late
        hours and damaged the back bumper whilst parked in the road. So then we parked off the
        road, and now on Saturday night all our Hubb caps have been stolen. If anyone has any
        information on the stolen Hubb caps we would much appreciate it. </td>
