        with a speeding car, my nephew was taken to hospital with a head injury
        - it could have been much worse. Just because somebody with no thought
        for anyone else wanted to get somewhere a bit quicker. Surely something
        could be done about these idiots who speed through the village before
        someone is killed.</td>

        <td width="80%">If you're travelling behind a lorry in a speed
        restriction zone, and can't see due to water/mud being thrown up, then
        maybe you should do the sensible thing and back off - you were obviously
        driving far too close. This will inevitably lessen your visibility in
        treacherous conditions. Sounds like you were being impatient and
        reckless to me. In regards to the burst tyre, I think it goes something
        like this: when driving don't break, you'll lose control, take foot off
        accelerator and put on your hazards, your steering will be pretty poor
        so don't try anything drastic, certainly don't panic, you should coast
        to a stop eventually. Going down the gears would help (engine breaking)
        to slow you down.</td>

        <td width="80%">Why did you follow the lorry down a dual carriageway
        without overtaking it on the dual carriageway? Seems a bit silly to wait
        until you are in a 40mph zone before gassing it up to 67mph? Surely you
        did not miss the 40mph signs? Coming from a 70mph dual carriageway into
        a 40mph zone, you would have expected some warning signs perhaps? Maybe
        you were just going too fast to see them! Speed traps shouldn't have to
        be visible, because if you weren't speeding in the first place, it would
        not induce panic and cause a serious accident, what a load of rubbish!
        Speed kills, but unfortunately until you have lost a member of your
        family through someone else's speeding and stupidity, idiots will still
        drive thinking they can bend the law to suit themselves! What are you
        saying, that it is alright to speed at night time as long as there is
        no-one about, although I would get your eyes tested because the police
        were about........and you didn't see them...so what else didn't you see?
        When you get hauled up in front of the magistrate/judge, I would do
        yourself a favour and just plead guilty, without all the waffle of
        trying to blame everyone else but you, and forget the old line of &quot;why
        don't you go and arrest some real criminals&quot; cos I don't think it will
        do you any favours in court! Hope you don't take this too personally,
        but sitting here reading your &quot;diary of events&quot; from someone who has
        lost their mother due to an idiot driver doing 73mph instead of the
        50mph....you get no sympathy from me!</td>

        <td width="80%">I was recently pulled over by traffic police and issued
        with a NIP for dangerous driving. The circumstances where the following,
        I had followed a lorry down a dual carriageway and was subjected to the
        dirt kickback from the lorry tyres impairing my vision; we travelled
        over a bridge approaching a roundabout on a dual carriageway. The lorry
        was travelling in the same direction as myself i.e. turning right at the
        roundabout onto another dual carriageway he took the inside lane and I
        decided to overtake to prevent further kickback and impaired vision, the
        road was clear and as the location was industrial there were no
        pedestrians on the stretch of road. My biggest fault was rather than
        pull back in front of the lorry and impair his/her vision I continued to
        accelerate until I was far enough in front of him to pull back into the
        inside lane. Because I was concentrating on the road and possibility of
        potential problems ahead, I did not see the traffic police, who must
        have set up their speed trap in area not visible to drivers unless
        noticed at the last minute that may inducing a panic that might have
        caused a serious accident. The police must have followed me on the next
        stretch of road, where I was driving way below the speed limit before
        pulling me over approx. 1x mile from where they set their trap. I was
        speechless when the officers informed that I was being charged with
        dangerous driving because of my speed, and as I had not been involved in
        any accidents, speeding offences or have any points on my driving
        licence over a period of 10 x years driving where I have driven over
        200,00 road miles I could not believe what was happening. I was naïve
        and was in shock, at the time I did not realise that dangerous driving
        was the worst category in driving offences, and still cannot understand
        why I was issued with this charge of serious nature. I admit that I was
        travelling in excess of the speed limit set for the road, 67mph on a
        40mph speed limit but I was travelling on the road at 10.30pm being an
        industrial zone nobody works at the time and there are seldom and people
        walking or driving on the road. So apart from the lorry which I over
        took in a text book manner and myself, I was not endangering any other
        road user or pedestrian. I would be interested if any one has heard of
        or been involved in something similar in nature. As mentioned earlier I
        did not understand the serious nature of the offence I was charged with
        and am worried that I may lose my driving licence, therefore my job and
        livelihood. On another subject, could somebody please clarify if traffic
        police are still considered police officers, because while I was in the
        car receiving the verbal NIP, a call come over their radio about a group
        of Asian youths being attached involving bricks, pipes and other weapons
        and there was nobody available to respond, the &quot;policemen&quot; charging me
        did not flicker to the request for attendance, my question is what is
        the real crime, speeding on a quiet road or possible murder through no
        attendance of public designated authorities.</td>

        <td width="80%">One of the worst kinds of dangerous driving is the habit
        of parking half on the pavement and half on the road. Meaning wheelchair
        and buggy users are forced to either wait for the motorist to return or
        get help to go in the road. Why do they do it? Could something be done
        to constructively stop this practice. Perhaps the community police could

        properly. Obviously, too, if speed bumps were installed there would be a
        local outcry and they'd be removed again a year or so later. The best
        solution would be lit '30' signs through the High St/Station Rd and at
        the top entrance to SC. Personally I enjoy setting my cruise control for
        29.5 mph and watching irate 4x4 drivers pile up behind me....</td>

        thought the idea was to slow traffic down in the village, not open the

        killed, Cars roar out of Broadway Lane by the cross. I think drivers
        come round the bend by the Oak and see a large open road and think, I
        can motor down here. What a waste of OUR money. SLOW THE TRAFFIC DOWN.</td>

        female driver in a white metro. I hope she gets banned from driving
        before she kills someone. I often see her doing 40, maybe 50 mph through
        the village and we all know what kind of damage that can do if she was
        to hit someone! What we need is more police controls in the village so
        we can catch people like her.</td>
