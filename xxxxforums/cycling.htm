        line (solid is 24 hour lane, dashed is temporary) and stick up a few
        warning signs - that's the cheapest and most effective way. Cycling on
        pavements is hazardous, and supposedly illegal (although rarely
        enforced), I confess to having done it myself - but again I stop for
        pedestrians</td>

        any cycle paths and the speed of traffic I feel that it is safer for me
        to keep to the pavements. I get off if I see people; about time there
        was more for cyclists. After all it is a pollution free transport; and
        good for people's hearts and fitness. You've said about young people
        wearing bicycle helmets, but what about the adults. I very rarely see
        adults setting a good example to the children.</td>

        that motorists need to accept some responsibility too. A child acting safely with a helmet
        has a 90% chance of being killed when hit by a car at 40 mph. This child would only have a
        10% chance of dying if that car driver had decided to drive at 20mph</td>

        <td width="80%">Well I think it's up to the parents to make sure that the children are
        safety conscence on the road. Make sure their children go out with a helmet on. Maybe get
        the children involved in safety courses for their own road sense and also cycling classes
        to improve their cycling and safety on the roads. </td>
