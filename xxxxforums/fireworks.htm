        the firework idiots of South Cerney have continued their practice to
        frighten witless the majority of our four legged friends with their
        activities and explosions. Did anybody complain to the police?</td>

        throughout the year now for fireworks to be discharged well after the
        restrictions of 2300 hrs. On Saturday 27/7/ 05 for instance we had
        fireworks being let off at half past midnight somewhere in the Broadway
        Lane area. Of course we have no police locally to deal with this
        violation of the law but do we have to put up with it - more importantly
        do our pets and wild life have to put up with it. Please call the police
        if you hear fireworks being let off after 2300 hrs so that they will
        know the problem developing in the village. As usual no interest from
        the parish council.</td>

        <td width="80%">Why are there fireworks going on already! I feel that
        there should be a rule for fireworks within such a small peaceful
        village such as South Cerney. Already there are bonfire works and so
        were there yesterday the 15th of October. This is not fair on the
        animals, People expect to keep the animals indoors for a few nights
        either side of the night. But not as many days before November 5th as
        this! Especially with no Pre-Warning.</td>
