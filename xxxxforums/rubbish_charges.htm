        <td width="80%">I have noticed on the side of the roads into cirencester the dumping of
        large items of rubbish. This looks as though it will be a continueing trend as people now
        have to pay for the removal of large items. This will hardly be a saving in the long term
        as ditches become full of rubbish. Surely the Council could have started a recyle cente
        for some of the furniture items to be sold on rather than dumped. </td>

        <td width="80%">Having contacted the Cotswold District Council with regard removal of
        items for the skip, I was told that there would be a charge for this service as from the
        1st of April, what next!!! after all we seem to have annual increases for the Council Tax
        and in return what do we get, continously reduced services. Most individuals cannot afford
        these extra charges or have the transport to take items to the designated tips.
        Consequently items will be left where ever, which I find just appalling. </td>
