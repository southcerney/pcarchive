        You moaners about noise are such idiots. If the &quot;noise&quot; of people
        enjoying themselves (ie music from festivals - people bringing trade to
        your community, aeroplanes, etc.) is too much for you, why not consider
        relocating to say New Zealand where there aren't so many people. The
        countryside does not belong solely to you. I concur with PC, because my
        own father fought for six years so that you could enjoy living in
        England's green and pleasant land. You don't own it just because you've
        bought a big house on your retirement. And yes, it will just serve you
        right if, as I write, central government have their eye on this &quot;space&quot;
        to house many of the newcomers to our Country who need asylum centres,
        houses, schools, hospitals, etc. etc. They can't all stay in London, we
        know that, so don't be surprised when they come to a field near you.
        Also, Devon is having a rubbish burning power station. How do you fancy
        one? They have to build them somewhere.</td>

        I have been working on a job near Brize Norton as a heating engineer and
        have enjoyed both watching and listening to the military aircraft take
        off, circle and land these guys need to practice to keep their skills

        I must say - this forum is rather pathetic and tedious to read. It
        strikes me that several people in South Cerney have 'Victor Meldrew'
        syndrome. Could it be that you have too much time on your hands and need
        something to moan about? You should be grateful that you have the Army
        as your neighbours. I find an immense amount of comfort and security
        knowing my neighbouring Barracks shadow me. I'd certainly rather keep
        them with their aircraft, weekend gliders and parachutists then say - a
        housing estate! Forgive me, but I thought there was a great British
        tradition of being neighbourly. Unfortunately, the few minority in this
        forum don't give that sense to the village of South Cerney. Ironically
        we were the only household in our area to support new weekend activity
        on this site and since then we've been invited to several open days,
        flight and barbeques as a result. It pays to be welcoming! When the new
        season starts consider this - our barracks were braining storming ideas
        for what to do on their site at the weekends. So far drive-in-movies and
        funfairs have come in to play! Consider yourselves lucky. Anyway, my
        real reason for being on this site. I have recently moved to the area
        and started work in an Estate Agents. Not knowing the area I began
        internet searches for the surrounding villages. I'm extremely
        disappointed with the sense of community in your area and I find it
        difficult to promote the place to any house hunts - plane fanatics or
        not.</td>

        Maybe you have tinnitus. Planes fly, they buzz, they zoom, they roar.
        They have done since the concept of air flight was introduced into the
        modern world. Why not move to somewhere like Cumbria or Northumberland,
        there's no need for RAF sites there, and so hopefully you shall find
        peace and quiet. The planes from Brize will be back there soon, and I
        have to say, I shall rather miss them, spotting the planes that my mum
        said she flew in when her father was in the RAF, and indeed, when my
        father was alive, flying off to do important work. I know that civilians
        jumping out of planes isn't particularly important, but if, like a lot
        of them are, they are doing charity jumps, all the better. Having had my
        father pass away just over a month ago from cancer, I can safely say
        that I would encourage any means possible to raise money for development
        into cancer research and funding for treatment.</td>

        Visitors to this site may be interested to know that the South Cerney

        parachuting activities carried out from the airfield. If this does not
        reflect your views, you should contact the parish council at the address
        on this web site. The Council also criticised the establishment of a
        liaison group between the local community and the army aimed at trying
        to reach constructive solutions to the problems of noise caused by
        commercial parachuting . The answer to GW is that the noise is caused by
        recreational and commercial parachuting groups which operate from the
        airfield in South Cerney.</td>

        a towny and have lived in cities/towns for all of 4 years. It seems

        is now 'disrupting the beautiful serenity of a place that used to be a

        No ! It might be insignificant to L A, especially as I see, you lived in
        Swindon and Bristol. That doesn't mean you are a Towny, but it might. So
        perhaps the noise issue is unlikely to worry you. Good for you. I see
        that quite a lot of people who, shall we say, are transitory residents
        here are pro parachuting and can't see the problem and don't care. The
        plane taking off doesn't bother me either (although my commiseration's
        for those who live in South Cerney and have to put up with the noise).
        It's what it does after it has taken off that bothers me. And as for TS;
        don't presume that most of us fly. What S Cerney has, is certainly not a
        gnat's whisper. It is a persistent loud annoyance which is disruptive to
        residents over a wide area. It's the duration of the noise that annoys.
        Wouldn't it be nice if some of the comments from the 'parachute

        difference is, that it's still being used even though the R.A.F. left
        it- at least it's not a waste land, with no use. If there are people
        learning to parachute, surely that would bring revenue to the area? If
        people do an activity such as that they would need somewhere to stay. I
        really don't know what the fuss is about. I live practically right under
        the flight path, and I'm not bothered. It really is a petty argument-

        I see the 'essential parachute training' season is upon us again. It's
        interesting to read the comments of those supporting this anti social
        activity. Why do they do that I wonder ? They seem very eager to
        maintain this noisy pursuit. Okay, why not introduce drag racing at
        night when the airfield's not in use. Or endurance power boat racing on
        the lakes. Since there has been so much noise since the 30's I am sure
        all you right thinking people would support this little money spinner.
        They just don't get it. If it didn't have such a detrimental affect on
        the environment and quality of life for so many, many, people in the
        Cotswolds, not just in South Cerney, we would care less about
        parachuting. Let me suggest a worthwhile compromise; take the engine out
        of the aircraft and I will stop complaining. If I allowed a private
        company to start a parachuting school on my land I would have to obtain
        planning permission. If I got it, it wouldn't hurt to bung a few quid at
        charities, invite the mayor for a jump and even ask the army to join in

        You wouldn't see the relevance because your biased against the jumpers.
        My experiences have involved real noise in the country and in the town.
        I'm the first to admit I was reared with the planes in RAF Abingdon's
        heyday so the noise you talk of is to nothing to me, but lets face it,
        its hardly ear shattering stuff in South Cerney! The people of Hemel
        Hempstead can't all move away if they don't like it! They haven't any
        choice! Surely only a selfish person would complain just to stop people
        enjoying themselves! I'm supporting those who want to jump. If you can't

        Yes, they are back with a vengeance. 11 days of continuous daily flying
        during the last 14 days. Both the Silver Stars and the RAF 'box van'
        have reneged on their announcements NOT to fly over South Cerney or
        other local settlements by flying around and across the village. The
        silver stars aircraft has been so low flying along Station Road that its
        registration number could be read with the naked eye. The 'droning' is
        back, no longer is the new aircraft quite when flying around and across
        the village for up to 20 minuets at a time. Why have the pilot[s]
        stopped flying away from the village to gain height? the aircraft has
        more than enough power to carry out this flight plan. It amazes me that
        so much rubbish can be written by others on this forum about the
        problems of aircraft noise pollution. One can hardly believe that
        LWW,KHB,LS &amp; others actually reside in S. Cerney. The Parish Council
        also appears to be completely out of touch with reality--nothing new
        there, for those sceptics among you, when the Silver Stars are flying,
        go out into your garden following the take off and watch the aircraft
        flight pattern--this will prove who is right and who is wrong and
        justifiable complains. Many residents of us in the Watermark complexes
        are fed up with weekend after weekend being spoilt by aircraft noise.
        The idiot who says move away if you do not like it just about sums up
        the average commentator on this Forum, those with an ounce of common
        sense write with correctness. We fully support the public petition which

        style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Because of the increasingly vehement nature of the letters to the
        press and on the web site Forum regarding the aircraft noise at South Cerney airfield, I
        am obliged to comment on the situation. <br>
        It has been implied that the Parish Council and myself as Chairman have been biased and
        unfair in our deliberations regarding the complaints from objectors to the noise from the
        aeroplanes used to transport the parachutists. These implications I totally refute<br>
        At Parish Council meetings I have always endeavoured to take an even-handed approach when
        chairing the debates regarding aircraft noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
        I have made efforts to bring together the two parties concerned and to build bridges.<span
        style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only did I welcome Alan de Derval to speak at
        the annual Parish Meeting but I arranged for representatives from the Army also to be
        present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The resulting meeting was, I
        thought, very useful and I was delighted to receive a letter from Alan stating that he was
        grateful for my efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, later
        in the year I personally wrote to HQ LAND asking formally that <u>all aeroplanes</u>
        dropping parachutists at South Cerney airfield should be obliged to keep to those rules
        which now set the time and flight pattern restraints placed on the Silver Stars.<span
        style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All these facts can be confirmed by the minutes of
        the Council.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What will not be obvious from
        those minutes was the excessive time that these debates took, nor will they show the
        amount of feeling that was generated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
        particular, at the Annual Meeting, I found it very difficult to prevent Alan being
        interrupted by those present, all of which, it appeared, were diametrically opposed to his
        views.<br>
        South Cerney Parish Council members truly believe that the aircraft noise protesters are a
        minority of the village population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        belief is based on our own individual experiences and also the Village Appraisal.<span
        style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We do refer to that excellent document whenever
        the need arises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We the Council, interpret
        the Appraisal figures regarding the noise from parachuting completely contrary to the way
        in which the objectors obviously do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We take
        the percentage of 18% (220 out of 1,243) as being a small minority.<br>
        Furthermore, it is obvious that the objectors have misunderstood or misinterpreted another
        question in the Appraisal, the one relating specifically to noise generated by Military
        aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those of us who live here all
        the week are fully aware that the majority of aircraft over-flying the village are
        military aircraft not based at South Cerney and not the little ones seen and heard at
        weekends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, when the data for the
        Appraisal was collected in 1997, we had been subjected to several years of really
        frightful noise from USAF KC 135 tankers flying out of RAF Fairford.<span
        style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was, I believe, the reason for the inclusion
        of the second question. For the objectors to now add the two sections together to claim
        that over 500 people were opposed to the parachuting is absolutely inadmissible. We were
        here in 1997, not all the present objectors were. <br>
        The current petition being organised by nameless individuals, confirms our reading of the
        amount of support for the campaign to stop parachuting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
        &nbsp; </span>The sheets on display at the Post Office have less than forty names and some
        of those are from people who do not reside in South Cerney. Granted the door-to-door
        canvassing will result in more signatures, but had there been really strong opposition to
        the current level of aircraft noise then surely there would have been very many more
        signatures on the first attempt to raise support for the campaign?<br>
        There have been other debates in our community where the minority view has been expressed
        the loudest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In such cases the Parish Council
        feels a responsibility to ensure that the views of the quieter majority are given due
        weight. The objectors&#146; contribution to the debate will continue to be given a full
        hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hope that everyone will understand
        that the Parish Council feels it should continue to ensure that the apparent majority view
        also be properly reflected.</span></font></td>

        training craft used by the Air Training corps. The practice of parachuting grannies for
        charity seems to have taken their place. For my part the military aspect is a just cause
        and the noise asociated with the continuance of their training is a small price that we
        have to pay for our freedom. I do appreciate the need to satisfy the needs of the
        &quot;activity sports people&quot; and to this end could we not compromise by only flying
        on Saturday and leaving Sunday free to allow the majority to enjoy the peace of the
        country side. Could I also ask for a list of all the week-end parachutists along with
        their connection to the military and also where they come from. I also wonder how many
        live in the area. </td>

        pollution it should be remember that in the 1999 Village Appraisal, some 590 residents
        objected to among other issues parachuting and aircraft noise. There is a considerable
        difference to the limited military flying activity and the normal 16 hours of aircraft
        noise pollution experienced 3 weekends out of 4 over South Cerney and other settlements.

        the variation in opinions. This feeling comes from having stayed in two different house
        styles in the village. If as I suspect the problems are at night, then this would explain
        why those in chalet style houses would be more likely to experience it. 2. It is obvious
        that this noise/vibration (yes, I have experienced it) does seriously affect a number of
        people, and that their opinions should be taken equally seriously. This is obviously not a
        trivial matter for them.</td>

        part of this community. The current Commanding Officer has gone as far as he can in
        listening to the demands of the few by restricting flying to 3 weekends in every 4 and
        setting strict flying times for the Silver Stars (flight paths are dictated by the
        prevailing wind and flight control at RAF Fairford and Brize Norton). The other aircraft
        flying out of South Cerney (which, as has been stated on numerous occasions, is an active
        military airfield) belong to the RAF and do not come under the Commanding Officer's
        jurisdiction. I personally would like to apologise to the Regiment for the unfortunate
        wording of some letters and points for the Forum page (ie 'bullying') from a minority of

        <p>1. Thank you for your letter of 12 August, addressed to Major Jones of 29 Regiment RLC,
        about aircraft noise. I have been asked to reply. My apologies for the slight delay in
        responding to your letter.</p>
        <p>2. I am sorry to hear that the inhabitants of South Cerney are being disturbed by
        aircraft noise. As you know, South Cerney is an authorised military airfield and as such
        is utilised by a variety of military aircraft. As Major Bruce explained at the Annual
        Parish meeting, an RAF Skyvan also makes use of the airfield at South Cemey, and this
        additional activity may have prompted some of the complaints you have received.</p>
        <p>3. As you have suggested, Major Jones has now written to the appropriate RAF
        Headquarters that controls the movements of the Skyvan. He has requested that wherever
        possible the Skyvan is restricted to operating within the weekend flying restrictions
        accepted by the Silver Stars. Unfortunately, the Skyvan is sometimes used to train
        Territorial Army personnel and the weekend is often the only time when they are available.
        As a result it will not always be possible for them to abide by the strict regime put in
        place by the Regiment. Having examined the flight records of the Skyvan, I have learnt
        that they have only flown on four weekends this year and, conscious of the effect that
        such flights can have locally, they are making every effort to keep their weekend flying
        to an absolute minimum.</p>
        <p>4. I can assure you that we take the concerns of your parishioners very seriously and
        are very keen on reaching an acceptable compromise, by which the Silver Stars and others
        can continue to fulfil their long standing training requirements, without unduly
        inconveniencing the local populace.</p>
        <p>5. I hope this is helpful.</font></p>

        Dear Major Jones<br>
        <br>
        <strong>AIRCRAFT NOISE</strong><br>
        <br>
        South Cerney Parish Council has recently received complaints from inhabitants of our
        village regarding aircraft noise at South Cerney.<br>
        <br>
        At our recent Annual Parish Meeting we were informed by Major Ian Bruce that<br>
        the Silver Stars now follow restricted flight timings and flight patterns. However the
        Parish Council understands that 29 Regiment RLC has no control over the flight timings and
        flight patterns of other aircraft who use South Cerney airfield, including the RAF who, we
        believe, use a Sky Van. Although those who attended the Annual Parish Meeting were made
        aware of this situation this has obviously not filtered through to other members of the
        Parish.<br>
        <br>
        The Parish Council would appreciate it if 29 Regiment RLC could pass the<br>
        concerns of some of our parishioners up through the chain of command. They<br>
        would also appreciate it if a request could be made to the other users of<br>
        South Cerney airfield to comply with the flight restrictions accepted by the<br>
        Silver Stars.<br>
        <br>
        The Parish Council would greatly appreciate your help in this matter.<br>
        <br>
        Yours sincerely,<br>
        Michael Stuart. Chairman, South Cerney Parish Council </td>

        airfield is an airfield where there will always be flying of some sort or another. If you
        don't like the sound of bells, you don't buy a house next door to a Church. If you don't
        like the sound of merriment you don't buy a house next door to a pub. If you don't like
        the sound of aircraft, then don't buy a house within a mile or so of an airfield. If you
        do, then you can have no cause to complain. Try living close to Heathrow or Gatwick for a
        while then you will find South Cerney is nothing to worry about.</td>

        hence half the take offs and landings) and then allowed a civilian to bring his two bladed
        prop small aircraft to the airfield. He has no military connection and operates as a
        civilian business as he was today on a Thursday. </td>

        of any formal military training - it is a recreational sport for servicemen in their free
        time and civilians who pay a fee. There is a great deal of noise which lasts throughout
        the weekend, especially for households in the flight path. Villagers who suffer from this
        noise should contact our local MP and the parish council. </td>
