        an individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is pointless complaining to this forum or to the
        Parish Council as they have no powers to deal with such problems.&nbsp; So
        please ring the police on 0845 090 1234. The more complaints they
        receive, the more likelihood there will be of action being taken.</td>

        business like this would thrive better, and be better supported by
        locals, if on the outskirts of the village?</td>

        it is just a big strip. Is it going to have writing on it, if so, why is it not on yet? It
        looks out of place like that and should be taken up. Also we should do something with the
        state of the road down Broadway Lane, there are always pot holes and it needs new tarmac.
        The foot paths are the same.</td>

        <td width="80%">Being reasonably new to Sth Cerney (two years), I find the high street
        empty compared with some other villages. Regards to the zebra crossing, which was turned
        down by parish council, If people from the north side of the village want to cross there
        is a set of bollards near ham lane, people lower down by the Oak are not going to walk all
        the way down to Ham lane /Mite area to cross the road. Most of the traffic around 9am is
        mums taking children to school by car, hence the heavy flow at that time of day, and at
        home times. I do agree that anything to slow the traffic down is a must, hence all the
        works going on at the moment. Narrowing of roads coming into the village like by the
        industrial units, will slow down cars and keep trucks out. Slow the cars as much as
        possible so that cars just wanting to pass through the village use the spine road.</td>

        no quarter to young or the less able persons trying to cross the road. There will be no
        Lolly Pop Lady this winter for the child who is late, in a hurry and probably not looking
        when crossing this road. Urbanise and save lives, small price to pay.</td>

        When is it ever going to be made safe? Could we also look again at delination of the
        footpath as frequently the footpath and the pavement are blocked and wheelchair users are
        forced to go onto the garage forecourt which is a very dangerous place as we are then
        below eye level of vehicles. This has been raised before? </td>
