    <br>
    <b>CHAIRMAN’S REPORT</b><br>
    <br>
    2006 Parish Council Chairman's report </p>
    <p>Before I start my report I wish to pay tribute to Dr Michael Bride one 
    time Chairman of this Parish Council. Michael died a few weeks ago after a 
    long period of ill health. I had the privilege of being on this council with 
    him and I learnt a great deal from him. He was a man of tremendous integrity 
    and he was dedicated to improving this village. He did his best for South 
    Cerney and for that we should all thank him. </p>
    <p>Last week when I started to prepare this report, having reread all the 
    minutes of the monthly Parish Council meetings for the year just gone, I was 
    reminded just how much work your Parish Council has got through and also how 
    many problems the village has been subjected to. We have experienced too 
    many unacceptable problems most of which were the result of either broken 
    promises or the lack action by those in higher authority. Fortunately, I 
    realised that although those problems were serious, the overall situation 
    with Cerney has been very positive and we as a community have achieved a 
    great deal in the year just gone by. </p>
    <p>Let's deal with the problems first. We have been subjected to the most 
    obnoxious situation of having the main pressurised sewerage pipe fracture 
    three times in a few weeks depositing raw effluent on the public roads, 
    footpaths, private gardens into ditches and then on into one of the major 
    lakes. People living close to the Thames Water pumping station in Robert 
    Franklin Way were particularly affected by the awful noise of tankers 
    removing slurry to Shorncote all through the night on too many occasions. 
    What was most upsetting was the apparent lack of urgency in Thames Water 
    accepting that there was a major problem with into structural stability of 
    the actual pipe mainly due to there being no records of when the pipe had 
    been installed. It took a lot of community effort including some excellent 
    work carried out by David Spencer and some hefty words by our MP Geoffrey 
    Clifton-Brown, before they eventually accepted that the pipe was beyond its 
    sell by date and was to be renewed. Let us trust that their promises are not 
    hollow and that we do in fact see that pipe renewed in the next twelve 
    months. </p>
    <p>The second problem also involves drains. The residents of Kingfisher 
    Place have a problem with foul odours from the sewers and that is also 
    taking too long to sort out. It does seem that Thames Water is taking action 
    but we will be working with the residents to ensure that a satisfactory 
    remedy is found.</p>
    <p>The next unacceptable problem is of course the filthy state of the main 
    Spine Road and other lesser roads adjacent to the various lakes where works 
    are ongoing. For several years this Parish Council along with several of our 
    neighbours, both sides of the county border have been horrified by the mud 
    and other debris deposited on those roads by the vehicles leaving those 
    sites. I am sorry to say that this Council are at odds with both the 
    District and County Councils as to the way in which to solve the problem. 
    The higher authorities seem to have spent the past few years trying to get 
    their neighbouring authorities to pay for the cleaning of the roads but as 
    money is short in all exchequers no one would pick up the tab! Eventually, 
    they have come to a sort of compromise situation whereby the Spine Road will 
    be swept three times each winter and twice each summer with the £9,200 bill 
    being split between the four authorities. There are two flaws in that set 
    up. Firstly, five cleanings a year is not enough and secondly, why should we 
    pay out of our Council Tax to clean up mess caused by contractors who should 
    be made to do the job or more importantly, taken to Court by the Police and 
    fined for depositing dangerous debris on the highway. In fact, at last 
    year's Annual Parish Meeting one of the Police representatives promised that 
    a PC Geoff Clay would be asked to keep an eye open for offending vehicles. I 
    wonder if any drivers have been prosecuted? If not, let us hope that action 
    will be taken in the very near future. </p>
    <p>Delays in getting anything done by higher authorities is a major concern 
    to this and most other parish councils. Such delays are usually 
    unexplainable and most times the people concerned seem to consider that 
    there is no delay. Prime examples must be the installation of various 
    traffic calming projects such as the interactive speed warning signs, the 
    provision of a pedestrian crossing in High Street and the speed limit 
    reduction on Cirencester Road. All of these have been &quot;in the pipe line&quot; for 
    ages but nothing has been completed yet. We cannot explain why it has taken 
    so long to get these relatively inexpensive jobs done but we hope that the 
    newly formed Gloucestershire Highways set-up will be more proactive than 
    they were under their old name. </p>
    <p>Another example is the proposed reopening of the sealed footpath between 
    Upper Up and Ann Edwards School. I cannot remember exactly when the request 
    that it should be investigated was made but it was probably at this meeting 
    in either 1999 or maybe 2000. Granted this is not a straight forward task 
    but surely it cannot take six or seven years to sort out? The worrying thing 
    is that we have been informed that such cases can and do take ten or more 
    years to complete! We understand that this file is sitting on the desk of 
    what was the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister so anything can have 
    happened to it! </p>
    <p>One final moan is about the allocation of the Second Homes Council Tax. 
    This parish has probably the highest concentration of second homes in the 
    county and we should be forgiven for thinking, even expecting to get some 
    financial benefit from the increase in the council tax element paid by the 
    occupiers of those buildings. As it turned out this council's application 
    for money to improve the facilities for our young people was turned down as 
    the CDC consider in their wisdom that it is easy to obtain money from other 
    sources for such projects. The Parish Council does not consider that to be a 
    satisfactory situation and request that the CDC do consider that this parish 
    deserves more recognition and adequate financial support from the Second 
    Homes pot. </p>
    <p>So much for the down side. </p>
    <p>Despite all the problems we have had a very positive even upbeat year 
    with some considerable successes. Last summer we won the Bledisloe Plate 
    which is awarded to the overall winner of the preceding year's small, medium 
    and large section winners of the Best Kept Village competition. So we have 
    won three out of the five prizes available in that competition so far this 
    century. </p>
    <p>We also won two category awards in the Gloucestershire Calor Gas Village 
    of the Year competition and came home with a thousand pounds in prize money. 
    The categories we won were for the Environment and Safer Villages. The 
    excellent work we have had done at the Upper Up park with the planting of 
    the super trees around the lake played a big part in our winning the first 
    section and our having pursued through the civil Courts the person who had 
    vandalised a village notice board was a factor in our winning the other. Let 
    us hope to do as well if not better this year. </p>
    <p>The Village Plan has been completed after a considerable amount of work 
    not only by parish councillors but also with excellent input by members of 
    the village and from our very good friends from GRCC especially Melanie 
    Tarrant. Cllr Christina Pollard must be thanked for the many hours of work 
    she put into that plan. We now need to put the Plan into action and to do so 
    we need a lot of help from you the public. We have set tasks and have in 
    fact already achieved some of the items on the plan. The rest are more than 
    feasible to complete so let's get on with it. </p>
    <p>One of the main objectives of the Village Plan is the formation of a 
    Youth Parish Council. Any one who has ever attempted to ask a teenager what 
    is needed or what they want will know that the answer is more often than not 
    &quot;I don't know&quot;. To get to the root of what young people want is to get a 
    group of them together and let them sort out what they want in their own 
    time and in their own way. Also, give them a budget within which they can 
    spend on their section of the community and then see what happens. With the 
    help of the CDC's Youth Participation Officer, Claire Dowan, South Cerney is 
    the first to have set up one of these Youth Parish Councils in the Cotswold 
    area. I know that we all await with great interest the feedback we will get 
    from these young people. Let us congratulate all of them who are giving up 
    their time to work on behalf of their age group. </p>
    <p>Any day now we will complete the purchase of the relatively new Pocket 
    Park at Jubilee Gardens. Many of you will remember that this council were 
    opposed to the building of houses on the fringes of that area a few years 
    ago and to prevent the further erosion of the remaining green space we 
    offered to purchase the land from the CDC for £1. To avoid their having to 
    keep the area maintained they agreed so we have another amenity area in our 
    community. If you have not seen that little area do go and have a look. It 
    is a very pleasant piece of ground which has been well landscaped before we 
    bought it. </p>
    <p>Ongoing maintenance is always a major part of our budget and this past 
    year we have had to replace the old safety surfaces below various pieces of 
    play equipment at Upper up and at Cerney Wick. To ensure that our little 
    ones are safe when using the playgrounds is of prime importance. </p>
    <p>We have again used the services of those people doing their service to 
    the community on the direction of the courts. Both Young Offenders and the 
    adults in the Community Payback teams have worked on several schemes around 
    the parish and we hope to continue using them again this year. They have 
    saved us a considerable amount of money over the past few years doing work 
    that otherwise we could not have afforded. </p>
    <p>Building work continues apace around the parish with the almost completed 
    Winchcombe Gardens development in Berkeley Close and the very grand second 
    homes at the Landings. On the commercial development side the industrial 
    park called the Evergreens is very impressive until you count the number of 
    cars parked outside the businesses already in operation. Tony Squire counted 
    in excess of two hundred vehicle movements last week which is impressive 
    until you count the number of cars parked outside the businesses already in 
    operation and we have several commercial units yet to be occupied. The 
    resulting increase in traffic flow through our village must adversely affect 
    us all and it is imperative that we do formulate a traffic management plan 
    in the near future. </p>
    <p>This parish is so fortunate to have such dedicated people living here. So 
    many work for the good of the community, often in such a way that most of us 
    do not realise they are doing so much. Your Parish Council has done a great 
    deal this year and I have the honour of being their Chairman. No Chairman 
    could ask for a better group to work with. The wide range of expertise these 
    people bring to the village is so beneficial to us all. The level of 
    attendance is very high, unlike many councils in other parts of the country. 
    Thank you all for your excellent work. Thanks have also to go to our top 
    man, our Parish Clerk, Maurice McKee. Maurice has maintained the high level 
    of keeping this Council on track through the maze of bureaucracy that we 
    have to contend with. He condenses our still over long meetings into minutes 
    that are precise and concise. Most importantly he deals with some quite 
    difficult situations with commendable patience. Thank you Maurice for all 
    your efforts, may they long continue.</p>
    <p>This year we have been able to cut the level of the Council Tax precept 
    by some £4,295 to a total of £57,000. This total figure represents an annual 
    rate of £42.19p per Band &quot;D&quot; dwelling in this parish. Your Council members 
    are all extremely proud of this parish and have budgeted to implement those 
    items listed in the Village Plan, besides the ongoing works that keep this 
    village as one of the best in this part of the UK for you to live in.<br>

    <b>REPORT BY POLICE INSPECTOR STEVE WILLIAMS AND PC JON PALFREY, RURAL BEAT 
    OFFICER</b><br>
    <br>
    Inspector Williams introduced himself as the replacement officer for 
    Inspector Jacka who recently retired. Also in attendance were PC Jon 
    Palfrey, Rural Beat Officer and PCSO Ian Yeomans. Chief Superintendent John 
    Henry had also been replaced by Chief Superintendent Dean Walker. Inspector 
    Williams described his beat area as an INA or Inspection Neighbourhood Area 
    which stretched from Bibury in the west to South Cerney and from Westonbirt 
    in the south to Lechlade. It was a huge area which could take 35 to 40 
    minutes car travel to journey between the furtherest points even with blue 
    lights flashing. </p>
    <p>Two important targets on his agenda were crime reduction and crime 
    detection. The first would be achieved in partnership with local communities 
    and the second was for the police. In the period from1st April 2006 until 
    yesterday 16th May recorded crime in the area was down by 10 percent. 
    Detection of crime which resulted in a sanction was up 2 percent from 30 to 
    32 percent. In the South Cerney area last year there were 21 crime instances 
    reported and this year it was 22. Comparing South Cerney with the rest of 
    the INA there was less than 1 percent crime reported here. </p>
    <p>Important venues at which residents could meet face to face with their 
    local police force were the PCCMs which were Police Consultation Committee 
    Meetings. These meet four times a year throughout the area. The last one was 
    held in Tetbury and the next was scheduled for Birdlip to which invitations 
    would be issued. Inspector Williams was heartened with the formation of the 
    South Cerney Youth Parish Council as a way in which to encourage youth to 
    become involved with their community.</p>
    <p>The Safer Community Team based at Cirencester was composed of one 
    Sergeant, 2 Police Constables and 5 PCSOs. Recent news articles regarding 
    issues with PCSOs had been distorted and he wished to provide a factual 
    account although he acknowledged that there were lessons to be learnt by all 
    concerned. Health and safety were serious considerations and in this case it 
    was the operational use of radio communication equipment which had caused 
    concern to the management team. After evaluation it had been decided that 
    the risk was minimal. </p>
    <p>He then addressed the problem of mud on the Spine Road which interested 
    and concerned him. It was difficult to police as the road had shared 
    responsibility with the neighbouring Wiltshire Constabulary. There were four 
    major companies in the vicinity of the Spine Road which have licences to 
    operate and the state of road cleanliness is one of the conditions with 
    which they must comply through the use of wheel washers and/or road sweeping 
    activities. If there is a complaint he suggested that it be reported to the 
    Highway Agency which would then assess the situation and if there was a 
    problem it would clean it up and charge those responsible for the exercise. </p>
    <p>He emphasised that the Gloucestershire Constabulary had always had a duty 
    to police the area including South Cerney and he gave his personal 
    commitment that this would remain the case. </p>
    <p>He then introduced PC Jon Palfrey who explained his duties as the local 
    Rural Beat Officer. Jon explained that it had taken him 10 years to get into 
    the post and he was especially keen as he was local from a rural farming 
    background and was now doing the job in which he was most interested. He 
    positively endorsed two main aims: 1. it was important to report anything 
    that was of concern to law and order (telephone 0845 090 1234) as 
    intelligence was one of the main weapons police used to fight crime and 2. 
    he gave numerous ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ on self protection and how to behave in 
    securing your property which would help dissuade thieves from stealing it. A 
    new idea to mark one’s property was now available. It was marketed under 
    Smart Water and if painted on it was nearly indestructible, indelible and 
    extremely hard wearing. Commercially it was available at £40 minimum charge 
    but the police have a kit available at only £15 and he encouraged the 
    audience to make use of this offer. </p>
    <p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Roberts produced a ball bearing which he 
    alleged had been catapulted through the window of his disabled wife’s 
    downstairs toilet. He suspected that it had come from BSC9, an adjacent 
    footpath which he pleaded with Inspector Williams is more regularly 
    patrolled. BSC9 was one of the busiest paths in the village as it was a 
    through route between the public houses and the fish and chip shop. He 
    complained that although he had reported the incident on 8th May he still 
    awaited a visit from the police. <br>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspector Williams sympathised with his 
    misfortune and he would get an officer to attend. Pedal cycle patrols will 
    be introduced in the near future to improve police visibility. Cllr Stuart 
    informed the meeting that he had asked Les Haines, CDC Community Support 
    Officer if cctv cameras could be reintroduced on Upper Up car park to deter 
    vandals. Mr Haines had promised to make every effort to comply but there was 
    only one camera available. </p>
    <p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenny Roberts reported that elderly 
    residents of Box Bush had complained to her that they were experiencing 
    abuse. <br>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC Palfrey encouraged her to inform those 
    afflicted to report all incidents to the call centre on 0845 090 1234. He 
    was also willing to meet elderly residents to discuss their problems. </p>
    <p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenny also complained about pavement 
    parking which made it difficult for disabled and elderly to use footpaths. 
    She suggested that a ‘drop box’ would be a good idea for residents to leave 
    suggestions and complaints for action. Mrs Selina Kingsbury informed her 
    that such a box existed in the Post Office. <br>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCSO Yeomans informed her that he had 
    issued fixed penalty notices to some vehicles he had caught pavement parking 
    both in Clarks Hay and Robert Franklin Way. </p>
    <p>Malcolm Hood supported the idea that residents report all suspicious 
    incidents in their neighbourhoods as this would enhance police intelligence. 
    PC Palfrey agreed that it was better that an incident be reported many times 
    than not at all. Sinead Peare, YPC member, suggested that youths should be 
    stopped before they could act in an illegal fashion. Inspector Williams 
    dismissed this idea as it was not always possible to determine if youths 
    were intent on unlawful acts or not. Cllr Stuart concurred that information 
    was a two way thing and feed back was a necessary part of the formula. He 
    then thanked the police contingent for their time and input. The police then 
    left the meeting to return to their duties.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CAPTAIN ALEX MITCHELL, 29 PC &amp; MOV REGT RLC</b><br>
    <br>
    This year has seen some changes to the regiment, its configuration and the 
    camp infrastructure as a whole. The regiment recently changed title to 
    become 29 Postal, Courier and Movement Regiment RLC and we have grown by a 
    further two Postal and Courier Squadrons, one based in Aldershot and the 
    other in Abingdon; the long term aspiration is to have both squadrons 
    collocated with the regiment in South Cerney. Infrastructural changes have 
    included the build of a new Junior Ranks Catering/Dining Facility, Wash down 
    point and the rebuild of an enhanced Workshop. Early next year should see 
    the build of two new Junior Ranks Accommodation Blocks and an Annex to the 
    Warrant Officers' and Sergeants' Mess. </p>
    <p>Over the last 12 months the regiment has continued to provide movement 
    support of troops and equipment worldwide; including postal and courier 
    support. Current operational commitments include a significant number of 
    personnel from the regiment being deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and the 
    Balkans; in addition small detachments have been / are deployed worldwide in 
    support of Exercises and ongoing commitments. </p>
    <p>The Regiment's prowess in the sporting arena has grown from strength to 
    strength; of particular note are the ladies ski team one of whom represented 
    GB on the Nordic World Cup circuit and members of the Silver Stars Display 
    team who represented GB in the World Sky Dive Championships.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CLLR M. BAINES (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Baines explained that he was one of three elected members of the 
    Cotswold District Council which represented the Water Park Ward of which 
    South Cerney and Cerney Wick were part. He reported that the political 
    structure of the District Council had politically changed from a Committee 
    to a Cabinet structure under Conservative control. He observed that because 
    of the changes his work load as a District Councillor had drastically 
    reduced and he had not enough to do.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CLLR MRS A. CLARK (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    Both Clive (Cllr C. Bennett, CDC) and I have served another year on the 
    Planning Committee and there are always a large number of applications in 
    the Parish of South Cerney. All applications go to the Parish Council for 
    its observations and these are always considered before decisions are made, 
    most decisions now delegated but not before we have discussed them with 
    Officers. </p>
    <p>The Spine Road has been pretty busy with building works, the hotel on 
    Lake 6 is now underway and the first amount of Section 106 money of £50,000 
    is due to be paid shortly. It is hoped that a small amount of this could be 
    awarded in Grants, the applications would need to be in connection with 
    nature conservation, wildlife improvements etc., and in talking to the 
    Officer I stressed that I hoped South Cerney would top the list for this. 
    Perhaps the Parish Council, School or some other organisation will put 
    forward a scheme. </p>
    <p>Work is continuing on the old jet ski lake, Lake 10 is shortly to receive 
    permission for the lodges there to start and there is an application in for 
    a Motel opposite the Gateway Centre. </p>
    <p>This work has caused the Spine Road to be continually dirty and the Water 
    Park Joint Committee has secured some new funding from the four local 
    authorities for the road to be cleaned with a suction cleaner five times a 
    year, but I am afraid in very wet weather the problem is still there. </p>
    <p>I have been part of the Project Board responsible for the new Leisure 
    Centre which I am pleased to say is open and everyone is very pleased with 
    it. Do visit if you haven’t already done so. </p>
    <p>I would like to congratulate Clive on his appointment as a Portfolio 
    Holder at the Annual Meeting last week and I will leave him to explain what 
    that covers.</p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR C. BENNETT (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    I have been included in the new Cabinet on the District Council and have 
    been given a portfolio called Strong and Safe Communities. </p>
    <p>It covers crime and disorder, promoting enterprise, marketing and Stow 
    Fair. A fair old package of trouble. It cuts across several departments of 
    the council and will involve working with partners from other organisations 
    in and outside Gloucestershire, including our friends in the Police. 
    Naturally, I am looking forward to the new job. At least I think I am. </p>
    <p>It means me dropping off the Licensing and Planning Committees. I had 
    completed three years as Chairman of the Licensing Committee and the 
    constitution requires me to step down as Chairman after three years. I 
    really enjoyed my time as Chairman of Licensing, especially during the 
    transition to the new Licensing Act and its impact on drinking hours. Last 
    November the Committee spent a whole week dealing with appeals from members 
    of the public against opening hours requested by some pubs under the new 
    act. That was the main hump but there have been several other appeals since 
    then for the licensing panel to deal with. </p>
    <p>Although I am no longer on Planning I will still be able to speak on 
    applications that relate to the Ward. </p>
    <p>Having danced through the daisies along the river bank trying to avoid 
    the numerous piles of dog mess I have asked the District Council’s dog 
    warden to pay a bit more attention to the footpaths in the village where 
    some inconsiderate dog owners allow their pets to foul. It is offensive as 
    well as being an offence. The dog warden has agreed to make random visits to 
    the village. So dog owners: you have been warned. There is an ample supply 
    of free poo bags provided by the District Council in the village Post 
    Office, so there is no excuse for dog owners not to clean up after their 
    pets. The warden will also check that the dog mess bins are emptied 
    regularly. </p>
    <p>Returning to my cabinet job, I think we are all aware that this is a very 
    safe area with very little crime. However, there are occasions when there 
    are activities taking place which upset people. These may be happening on a 
    regular basis. Please do not be afraid to report these events. If you do not 
    want to report them directly to the police then give me a call. If something 
    is happening in the middle of the night I would appreciate the call in the 
    morning. If an incident is not reported then, statistically, it did not 
    happen. Often something can be done to stop the activity. Part of my new 
    responsibilities will mean that I will be working more closely with Claire 
    Dowan, Youth Participation Officer and I will have some influence on the 
    distribution of grants and having crime and disorder as part of my new 
    portfolio I can hopefully influence the location of cctv cameras. </p>
    <p>Cllr Stuart reiterated Cllr Bennett's assertion on reporting incidents 
    stating that it was more effective if people rang in to complain as this 
    would create a noticeable hot spot and bring the event to the notice of the 
    authorities. </p>
    <p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resident enquired when would CDC stop 
    holiday home development? </p>
    <p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) explained that each 
    application was treated individually. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Jay informed the 
    questioner that it was highly unlikely as the area had been designated as a 
    sport and leisure facility and development would continue. </p>
    <p>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the condition of the Lakeside 
    car park? <br>
    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) advised that question 
    be addressed to the Cotswold Water Park.<br>

    <b>REPORT FROM ALL HALLOWS CHURCH</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Squire in his role as Church Warden made this report because, as he 
    explained, the Vicar, Rev John Calvert was unavailable as he was negotiating 
    the sale of his house in Brixham, Devon. </p>
    <p>Speaking without notes, Mr Squire drew the attention of the meeting to 
    Graham James, a resident, who was noteworthy as the Bishop’s Visitor to 
    Schools. </p>
    <p>He reminded those present that all would be welcome to see the Bishop and 
    other church dignitaries consecrate the extension to the graveyard on July 
    11th. It should be quite a spectacle to see the main participants dressed in 
    their robes to perform the ceremony. </p>
    <p>Of the residents in Cerney Wick, 91 out of 95 had agreed to convert part 
    of the church there into a community centre and so guarantee its existence. </p>
    <p>The glass in the West End Window, circa 1320, in All Hallows Church 
    needed to be rejigged as it was becoming loose. Work carried out in 1862 by 
    Victorians was no longer reliable. Mr Squire said that he would be 
    organising fund raising events to pay for the repair and was confident that 
    the large sum needed would be achieved.<br>

    <b>REPORT FROM THE HEADTEACHER STEPHEN RICHARDSON  READ ON HIS BEHALF BY 
    ROGER EDGAR A GOVERNOR OF ANN EDWARDS SCHOOL</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Personnel</b><br>
    We have seen more changes in staff this year. Mrs Jocqui Partridge, Mrs Anne 
    Ford, Mrs Debbie Godwin and Mrs Julie Chapman were taken on as teaching 
    assistants and Mrs Hazel Pinlayson as a part-time teacher. We also say 
    goodbye to Mrs Jan Waters who has been a teacher at the school for 23 years 
    as she heads into retirement with our thanks and best wishes. The governing 
    body has also seen more changes with Mrs Sue Gould taking over as Chair and 
    Mr Martin Woodward joining us as a parent governor.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Curriculum and SATS</b><br>
    All the children in KS2 and Y2 are about to take their optional or statutory 
    SATs and our SATs results for 2005 were very pleasing, with excellent 
    progress being made by children within the school and pupils achieving well 
    at the end of KS2. The school continues to offer a good quality of education 
    for its pupils and they receive a broad and balanced curriculum. We remain a 
    category 1 school within the LEA.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other extra curricular school activities</b><br>
    The school continues to offer a full range of after school clubs including 
    for example, football, netball, tag rugby, cricket, rounders, cookery, 
    gardening, Spanish, computer, chess, bug club, scrabble club, modelling/warhammer 
    club, French, drama and judo. These are well attended by the pupils. We have 
    held adult learning courses at the school working with the Family Learning 
    centre and Parentline Plus. Our Y4, Y5 and Y6 children have either taken 
    part in or will soon be taking part in residential visits to The Wilderness 
    Centre. Braeside, SCOEC and Skern Lodge. We have recently contributed 
    artwork to the Gateway Centre, Deer Park School and the Village Flower Show 
    and the church continue to use our facilities for events throughout the 
    year.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Footsteps – Educating towards a more sustainable future</b><br>
    We have continued our link with the Joel Omino School in Kisumo and we have 
    received their Golden Tapestry for display at the Commonwealth Games. Both 
    tapestries have been sent to the Games.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other projects</b><br>
    We have had visits from the Lifestyle Education Bus, various theatre groups, 
    Nick Williams the Birdwise man and the children have visited SCOEC for 2 
    days. Pupils have taken part in the Dance Festival, schools swimming gala 
    and played a number of sporting fixtures against other schools. We have 
    worked with the Playgroup to facilitate their expansion and we will be 
    developing our own school grounds considerably over the coming months.</p>

    <b>REPORT BY MRS A. STUART, SECRETARY VILLAGE HALL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</b><br>
    <br>
    Once the new curtains were hung and the carpet tiles laid in the Committee 
    Room the Village Hall Committee could safely say all the major expenditure 
    had come to an end. The curtains really did put the final touches to the 
    look of the hall and everyone seems to be delighted with the final result. 
    To celebrate the completion of all the major works we held a very enjoyable 
    drinks party on 30 October where our principle guest was Stephen Wright MBE, 
    the head man of the Gloucestershire Rural Community Council, who were 
    instrumental in obtaining at least £27,000 in grants for the village hall, 
    plus giving us invaluable advice. This party was also attended by over 100 
    invited guests, followed by an Open afternoon. </p>
    <p>
    The hall is now up to a high standard. On the work front this year has been 
    somewhat quieter. Not so on the lettings. Due in no small measure to the 
    hard work of the Caretaker, who keeps the hall looking so good, our lettings 
    have increased yet again by 15%. Whilst the hall has been let on most 
    evenings for a number of years, we were pleased to see that it is being used 
    quite substantially during the day. One afternoon project we introduced was 
    Tai Chi, which has been very well supported. </p>
    <p>
    David and Sarah Smith continued to run the Cerney Cinema until February of 
    this year, when they left to concentrate on their own production in the form 
    of a baby daughter. We were very grateful for all the work they put in 
    running this project and wished them well. Mike took on the running of the 
    Cinema, with the assistance of Hilary, Tommy Walker and myself and the help 
    of Brian and Anne Viner. In the winter months attendance at the cinema was 
    down, due almost certainly to the inclement weather and poor choice of films 
    (which is outside of our control). However attendance in the last 3 months 
    has been excellent and we have raised a considerable amount of money towards 
    village hall funds. </p>
    <p>
    Over the course of the year there have been numerous small jobs which have 
    needed to be attended to, many of them undertaken by Mike and Peter at no 
    cost to the hall. Our thanks go to them, especially Peter, who, after many 
    years, is standing down from the post of Treasurer. Thankfully he has agreed 
    to stay as an elected member of the committee.</p>
    <p>
    At this point I would like to thank the Parish Council for their continued 
    support. Without their generous annual grant, which more or less covers our 
    massive insurance premium (in excess of £3,000 per annum) we would have had 
    insufficient funds to continue running the hall. Although I should add, this 
    year, for the first time ever, taking into account all of our expenditure, 
    we did make an overall profit of £106. </p>
    <p>
    Finally I am pleased to say that the Trustees of the Village Hall continue 
    to be very proactive. Attendance at committee meetings is excellent and 
    generally everyone works for the good of the hall.</p>
    <p>
    Thank you to everyone.<br>
    <br>
    <b>RESIDENTS’ STATEMENTS</b> </p>
    <p>
    Raymond Fenton promoted the Parish Council web site and encouraged residents 
    to log on. Roger Edgar added that the school site had a link and could be 
    accessed easily. </p>
    <p>
    Graham Stanford congratulated the Parish Council on the spring display of 
    daffodils throughout the village. Cllr Stuart reminded him that it was the 
    South Cerney Gardening Club which was responsible for the original planting 
    of the 5,000 bulbs. </p>
    <p>
    Mr Wrightson wished it to be known that in his opinion the Cerney News was a 
    very good and informative publication and those involved in its production 
    and delivery should be congratulated.</p>
    <p>
    Jenny Roberts said how very welcome the harvest parcels had been. </p>
    <p>
    There being no further business Cllr M. Stuart closed the meeting at 9.35pm.</p>
