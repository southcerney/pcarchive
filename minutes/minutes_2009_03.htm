 4th FEBRUARY 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and seconded by Cllr 
 Mrs Chubb that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Cllr Webb abstained 
 as he had not been present at the meeting. The remainder of the Parish Council 
 was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the Youth Parish Council attended the 
 meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay enquired if a date and venue had been arranged 
 for a meeting of the Traffic Committee. Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to book the 
 Village Hall or its Committee Room for a meeting at 6pm on Monday 30th March 
 and invite Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart, Dr Peter 
 Stephenson, David and Jan Hughes and David and Jenny Roberts to attend. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on his meetings with Amanda Keys (GCC 
 PROW officer) regarding the forthcoming public local inquiry into the path 
 known locally as the Barracks footpath. Cllr Nicholas stated that Ms Keys was 
 immensely helpful and had put a huge amount of work into preparing this 
 application. The inquiry is a very rigorous process and it has been in excess 
 of 10 years since GCC considered the original application which it voted to 
 accept because of its proven use. As objections had been lodged the outcome of 
 the application will now be determined by this inquiry. The inquiry is to be 
 held in the Village Hall on Wednesday 15th July starting at 10am. Cllr Nicholas 
 briefed the Parish Council on the process of the inquiry. Ms Keys would like 
 volunteers at the inquiry to read their statements and be subject to questions. 
 Cllr Nicholas asked Parish Councillors to guide him as to which of those who 
 made statements would be prepared to volunteer. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay and Cllr Kimberley both disagreed with the 
 conclusion of Cllr Parsons (GCC) that back filing earth works on Lake 16 had 
 ceased and asked the Clerk to inform Cllr Parsons that the work was continuing.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 26th February I attended a Chartered Parishes 
 meeting held in the Conference Room of Barnwood Fire Station, Gloucester. There 
 was an update from Sheila Corkett Partnership Manager, on how the consultation 
 of the new partnership has been progressing. The partnership consists of 
 representatives from Gloucestershire Highways, Gloucestershire County Council 
 and Gloucestershire Constabulary all now sharing part of the 5th floor in Shire 
 Hall. This partnership will eventually lead to a better understanding of the 
 problems and frustrations which blight the coordination of traffic matters in 
 the county and should, in future, make the implementation of schemes that much 
 more easier. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Due to my absence on annual leave during February there 
 were 10 working days available. During this time I averaged 4 hours 20 minutes 
 per day which is well in excess of my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 9th MARCH 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr 
 Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Provision of indoor facilities for youth groups</b>. 
 Cllr Kimberley stated that there was a growing concern from organisers of the 
 youth groups, especially Young Gloucestershire, on the lack of progress in 
 providing an enclosed venue for off street activities. The Clerk enquired why 
 the groups had not availed themselves of offers from the churches in the 
 village. Cllr Kimberley pointed out that the accommodation suggested was 
 fragile and furthermore some of the youths might be intimidated by using church 
 property for their activities. Cllr Caunce argued that it was important to 
 demonstrate a need for such accommodation in order to drive the scheme forward. 
 Cllr Harris had been in contact with Ian Kennedy from the Scout group who 
 informed him that he was waiting for the association to respond to his enquiry 
 about the use of the Scout Hut in Berkeley Close. Cllr Nicholas would make 
 enquiries about the availability of empty warehousing on the industrial site 
 off Broadway Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2510 – <b>Certification of MUGA</b>. The situation 
 had not changed. £2,000 is being withheld from Park Leisure’s account until the 
 remedial work has been completed. When the job has been completed 
 satisfactorily the remaining payment will be made and the Completion 
 Certificate presented to Rosemary Lynn (CDC) for accreditation by the BLF (Big 
 Lottery Fund). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2510 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards.</b> Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb would liaise with Gloucestershire Constabulary on the positioning of the 
 shelter. Cllr Mrs Chubb stated that the preferred suppliers of the “off the 
 shelf” shelter preferred to erect the structure prior to the base being laid. 
 Cllr Stuart stated that before contractors could estimate for laying a concrete 
 base it would be necessary to peg out the site. Contractors should be asked to 
 quote to cut out and remove the turf, prepare a firm level base of 
 approximately 6 inches depth of concrete. The Clerk will ask Kevin Messenger, 
 Dean Wheeler and Will Daniels to quote for the work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2510 – <b>“Shorncote Link”</b>. Cllr Stuart had a 
 further meeting with Mike Barton and Sarah MacDonald (PROW officers GCC) to 
 discuss the diversion of the footpath on Mrs Ruth Berry’s land alongside the 
 hedge adjacent to the football pitches. From correspondence received it has 
 been recommended that part of BSC 6 and BSC 7 is extinguished. Estimates of the 
 cost are £2,300 which would include about £900 for local press advertising. If 
 the Parish Council is minded to agree with the plan for the public rights of 
 way at Upper Up, Cllr Stuart volunteers to negotiate with Mrs Berry. It was 
 proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council 
 gives Cllr Stuart authority to negotiate on its behalf with Mrs Berry to 
 achieve a positive result for the planned realignment of the public rights of 
 way on Upper Up playing fields and Mrs Berry’s adjacent field. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. It was also agreed that it would be worth while 
 waiting for the outcome of the inquiry into the Barracks footpath before 
 proceeding with the Upper Up changes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Murphy will complete the reinstatement of the new pathway 
 on Upper Up later this week and grass seeding will take place later. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Work on the Bow Wow steps by Steve Hanson and the Payback 
 in the Community team was awaited. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk had contacted Adrian Gibbs who verbally 
 confirmed that he intended to start grass cutting around the 23rd of March. 
 Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to have Mr Gibbs contact him before cutting the 
 sides of the lake at Upper Up.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play area was all in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. The 
 safety surface and other refurbishment to the play equipment had been 
 reinstated satisfactorily.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he would be contacting James Scott regarding a 
 general clean up of the cycle mound area. In his opinion there was too much 
 débris and broken pallets strewn about the area. Murphy contractors had 
 delivered a large pile of ballast to make up the footpath as agreed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Two contractors who had been unsuccessful in their 
 quotations for the ground maintenance contract had enquired why this should be. 
 The Clerk was asked to reassure both that all quotations had been considered in 
 detail and that the Parish Council greatly appreciated the effort made by the 
 contractors in submitting their tenders. One contractor had suggested that his 
 estimates had been used as a “stalking horse” which was totally rejected by 
 members of the committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommended that the Finance Committee 
 agrees to pay R.O.W. Berry for the reinstatement work carried out at Robert 
 Franklin Way play area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr 
 Kimberley that the Committee recommended that the Finance Committee accepts the 
 quotation from R.O.W. Berry for £85 to repair the locking mechanism on the 
 notice board at Clarks Hay. The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
 that the Committee agrees to the quotation from R.O.W. Berry for £35 to repair 
 the vandalised picnic table previously sited by the lake on the Upper Up. The 
 Committee was all in favour. The Committee asked the Clerk to inform the 
 Finance Committee that it had agreed under its discretionary payment power to 
 ask R.O.W. Berry to repair the vandalised bench, now resting in Cllr Stuart’s 
 garden, for the sum of £35.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PREPARATIONS FOR GRAND OPENING OF FACILITIES ON UPPER
 UP PLAYING FIELDS </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Caunce that 
 a sub committee be convened to plan for the official opening of facilities at 
 Upper Up, including the completion of the sewerage works, the MUGA and shelter 
 installation and the rebuilding of the Football Club’s changing rooms. The 
 Clerk was to invite members of the Parish Council, Youth Parish Council, 
 Tennis, Football and Cricket Clubs, District Councillors and Ian Kennedy as a 
 representative of the Street Fair Committee and Scout Association to attend a 
 meeting at 7pm on Monday 23rd March to formulate plans for the event. The Clerk 
 was asked to book either the Village Hall or its Committee Room for the 
 occasion. The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Jay that an item 
 to release funds for the event be included in the agenda for next month’s 
 Finance committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reminded members of the Committee that the 
 next Police Panel would take place in Siddington on 15th April. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported on his snow warden activities during 
 February. He asked that Clerk suggests to Gloucestershire Highways that the 
 streets leading to the school from Broadway Lane be included in secondary 
 gritting activities in future. The school had remained closed for an extra day 
 because Berkeley Close, and especially the turn around area outside the school, 
 had not been salted when all other roads in the area had been cleared. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked if Adrian Gibbs had accepted the 
 ground maintenance contract. Although the Clerk confirmed that he had written 
 to Mr Gibbs and spoken to him on the telephone, there had been no written 
 confirmation of his acceptance. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the PROW finger post sign with 
 dog mess bin attached had been removed from the entrance to the Bow Wow. The 
 sign post had been found down stream and cut up. There was no sign of the dog 
 mess bin. The Clerk was asked to inform GCC PROW and request a replacement 
 sign. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report to Gloucestershire 
 Highways that an Ash tree and an adjacent wall had been damaged in Bow Wow when 
 one of the poplars had fallen. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris would liaise with Cllr Webb and carry out the 
 annual tree survey in the near future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on the inaugural meeting of the 
 Composting Club. Cllr Nicholas was disappointed that only 6 new faces had 
 attended and he remains to be persuaded if the idea is worthy of investment. 
 Cllr Jay emphasised that the plan was for the medium term and would surely 
 develop over time. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the Parish Council underwrites the cost of the initial building work to 
 start the project to the sum of £1,200. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb requested Cllr Harris for direction on how 
 to manage the inter parish tree competition. There was some confusion over 
 where the instructions were located. Cllr Kimberley suggested that Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb contact Kim Carter from the Play Group for further information. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge was concerned with the increase in fly 
 tipping on Northmoor Lane. Cllr Nicholas stated that it was illogical for the 
 CDC to restrict access to official dumps and then expect contractors to make 
 their arrangements to use the facility the day before. The outcome was 
 inevitable through the evidence of increased fly tipping. The Clerk was asked 
 to write to CDC to thank it for its prompt response to a recent incident but to 
 suggest that current regulations provokes such behaviour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley complained about the amount of dog mess now 
 appearing in and around Beverstone Road. He asked the Clerk to enquire if signs 
 could be provided to encourage animal owners to clear up after their pets and 
 for the wardens to focus their attention on this area. It was further suggested 
 that the dog mess bin, currently at the start of Gypsy Lane, be moved to where 
 the “short cut” breaks through the established fence in order that the 
 receptacle is in a more convenient location.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk read the list of items on the Task List some of 
 which had been accomplished and others outstanding but in hand.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Lady Fanshawe responded to the enquiry from the Parish 
 Council over which sections of the river Churn she claimed the riparian rights 
 by asking if the Parish Council wished to know which part of the river bank she 
 considered her responsibility. The Clerk was to reply in the affirmative. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to ask Cllr Parsons (GCC) if he would kindly 
 share his evidence on the granting of permission to General Walker to plant the 
 Poplars in Bow Wow 35 years ago. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.27pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY
 9th MARCH 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb had attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land had made an apology for her absence due to a family emergency. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SPREAD SHEET ANALYSIS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that with the period almost complete the 
 expenditure detailed on the spread sheet was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE PLAYING FIELDS 
 AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to pay R.O.W. Berry for the 
 reinstatement work carried out at Robert Franklin Way play area; accepts the 
 quotation for £85 to repair the locking mechanism on the notice board at Clarks 
 Hay; agrees to the quotation from R.O.W. Berry for £35 to repair the picnic 
 table previously sited by the lake at Upper Up. The Finance Committee was in 
 agreement with all the recommendations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr 
 Kimberley that the Parish Council accepts the recommendations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 Cllr Webb declared a prejudicial interest in this item as he was a member of 
 the Parochial Church Council and absented himself from the discussion. <br>
 A request for a donation from the Heritage Fund had been received from Mr T. 
 Squire, Churchwarden of All Hallows Church. Various parts of the churchyard 
 were suffering from the effects of ageing and are in need of refurbishment. A 
 detailed list of work required was included. <br>
 The Committee recommended that the Parish Council should be minded to release 
 £3,000 from its reserve fund to subsidise the necessary work. <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish 
 Council agrees to make a grant of £3,000 to the Parochial Church Council from 
 its reserve fund. The Parish Council was all in favour. <br>
 Cllr Webb returned to the meeting. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had analysed the requirements for the Calor 
 Gloucestershire Village of the Year competition 2009. Villages will be judged 
 across five categories: Children and Young People; Economic Development and 
 Enterprise; Healthier Communities and Older People; Natural Built Environment 
 and Safer and Stronger Communities. The competition is about recognising, 
 rewarding and encouraging vibrant and sustainable village communities which 
 pull together to make the best of local opportunities through both good times 
 and bad. Cllr Kimberley agreed to make the response for the Children and Young 
 People’s section. It was suggested that Emily Hallett from Young 
 Gloucestershire, members of the YPC and Katherine Isles might also contribute. 
 Cllr Nicholas would oversee the response to Economic Development and Enterprise 
 possibly with the help of Raymond Fenton. Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Stuart 
 and Reta May Matthews would be invited to make the response for the Healthier 
 Communities and Older People section. Cllr Caunce and Cllr Harris would take on 
 the Natural Built Environment. Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart will make the case for 
 Safer and Stronger Communities and invite the vicar, Revd David Bowers and Tony 
 Squire to participate also. The deadline for completion was Friday 8th May. 
 Cllr Stuart will forward the web link to all Parish Councillors in order that 
 they have access to the relevant sections for completion.</p>

 vehicles were cutting up the surface. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the river bank verges through Bow Wow 
 had been top dressed and the bank reseeded. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">BSC12 the footpath from the George pub car park was 
 impassable as it was very overgrown and part of it had been claimed by the 
 river. The Clerk will contact Mike Barton from GCC PROW to see if there is a 
 possible solution to this problem. <br>
 There was an unacceptable accumulation of litter in and around Lakeside car 
 park which was disappointing. The Clerk will report the problem to Ali 
 Swainston head ranger at the Water Park. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that he had been in contact with Max 
 Jones from GCC Trading Standards about the advertisements on Waters Edge near 
 to the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Station Road and Spine Road junction. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that a towed caravan, sited on the 
 car park of the Crown Inn, Cerney Wick was permanently occupied and asked 
 fellow Councillors to keep a watchful eye on the situation. </p>

 Officer that the advertising signs on Spring Lake on the corner of Station Road 
 and Spine Road were still in place. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the sewage leak in Station Road, 
 near Lakeside car park, continued. The Clerk will remind Hilary Beach (CDC) of 
 the matter and ask her to investigate as a matter of urgency.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the pipework as well as the 
 gullies through Cerney Wick needed to be cleaned. The Clerk will inform Chris 
 Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways of her concerns. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on the potentially dangerous 
 condition of the road from Ewen to South Cerney, specifically, between Tudmore 
 Cottage and Berry Farm crossroads (Ashton Keynes/Cirencester/South Cerney/Ewen) 
 when water accumulates in a hollow in the road after rain. It is especially 
 dangerous at night time when drivers can be caught unaware when they drive 
 through the resultant mini flood after a rain shower. The drains possibly need 
 to be cleared. The Clerk will ask Kent Harrison, Clerk to Siddington Parish 
 Council to report the incident to Gloucestershire Highways. Cllr Caunce 
 suggested to Cllr Nicholas that he could telephone Gloucestershire Highways on 
 08000 514 514 and report the incident himself.</p>
