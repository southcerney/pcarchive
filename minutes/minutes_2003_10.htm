    <td>One member of the public Susan Andrews and a press reporter from the Wilts &amp; Glos
    Standard were in attendance<br>
    The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Baines (CDC) and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    A proposal from the Chairman Cllr Stuart that a letter from Ms S. Andrews be discussed was
    agreed by Parish Councillors.<br>
    Ms Andrews had written to the Parish Council expressing her concern that the installation
    of the zebra crossing had been cancelled. Cllr Jay agreed that the Parish Council had
    objected to the scheme as precise plans had not been available but not to the principle of
    the crossing itself. Cllr Jay and Cllr Nicholas asked Cllr Parsons (GCC) if it was
    possible for the Parish Council to have more input on the consultation. Cllr Parsons (GCC)
    agreed to liaise with GCC Highways and arrange a meeting with Mr John Whittaker and Mr
    Martyn Summerell for the Parish Council to have a meaningful consultation although he
    emphasised that the Parish Council would not have a veto over whatever decision was
    reached. Cllr Bennett (CDC) queried the need for such a crossing as he could not recall
    the occurrence of a serious accident over the past 30 years.<br>
    Ms Andrews left the meeting at 8pm.<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Minutes after
    alteration were a true and accurate record. Cllr Caunce abstained from voting as he was
    absent from the September meeting. The rest of the Parish Council was all in favour and
    the Minutes were signed by the Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Kingfisher Place Adoption</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas declared a professional interest. Residents of Kingfisher Place were
    experiencing difficulty in persuading the developer Redcliffe Homes, Gloucestershire
    County Council and Watermark in reaching agreement on the adoption of the road servicing
    the development. Cllr Parsons (GCC) volunteered to act as a facilitator between the
    parties although he could not advise that GCC take the risk of adopting the road when the
    legal right for drainage that is necessary for that road is not in place. The Clerk was
    asked to arrange a meeting between Mr Tom O'Connor (Redcliffe Homes), Mr Ray Jenkins
    (Watermark), Mr Brian Corke (Kingfisher Place resident), Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Parsons
    (GCC) to discuss how the problem might be resolved.<br>
    <strong>Dental Practice</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that the Enforcement Officer had informed him he had instructed that
    the sign Dental Surgery be removed within 28 days.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    The Clerk informed the Parish Council that on Tuesday 16 September he had met with Cllr
    Squire and Mr S. King to design a tender document for the refurbishment of Robert Franklin
    Way play area. A draft was prepared and copies delivered on Thursday 18 September to Cllr
    Squire, Mr King and Cllr Mrs Chubb for their comments. Cllr Squire brought a revised
    tender which was sent out to 8 suppliers for quotation. On Tuesday 23 September D. Taylor
    GCC Highways visited me and passed on a request from a new CDC Cllr (for the Water Park)
    that the Parish Council prune the Lime trees in Silver Street.<br>
    On Monday 29 September I had a meeting at Robert Franklin Way play area with a
    representative from Wicksteed to discuss the tender.<br>
    In September I logged 90.5 hours which averaged 4 hours 5 minutes per available working
    day or 20.5 hours per week.<br>
    Cllr Bennett left the meeting at 8.25pm.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 6 October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Litter Picking</strong><br>
    Mr Curtis had agreed to the revised contract to litter pick for one hour Monday to Friday
    for £100 per month. The Committee agreed to the Clerk's suggestion that a short handled
    litterpicker be purchased for Mr Curtis.<br>
    <strong>Grass Cutting</strong><br>
    The Committee was very pleased with the quality of the new grass cutting arrangement.<br>
    <strong>Bow Wow</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to enquire from Rob Bull, CDC when the street sign could be expected.<br>
    <strong>Grass Cut at Upper Up</strong><br>
    James Harris confirmed that the cut of the newly sown areas had been carried out as agreed
    with the Parish Council at Upper Up.<br>
    <strong>Ladder Bars</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agrees to
    an increase of £65 on a previous estimate from James Harris for £110, to replace all the
    ladder rungs on the activity area, as an extra length of aluminium will have to be
    purchased to complete the work.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>War Memorial</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart volunteered to tidy up the War Memorial surrounds
    in preparation for the annual Remembrance Day parade.<br>
    They further agreed to carry out other necessary minor maintenance work throughout the
    village.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way play area</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agrees to
    accept quotes from R. O. W. Berry to prune a pyracantha hedge to approximately 5 feet for
    £95 and to level and seed old goal area for £75. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Trees in Silver Street</strong><br>
    D. Taylor GCC Highways informed the Clerk that one of the new Water Park District
    Councillors had reported that trees in Silver Street, owned by the Parish Council, were
    overgrowing the carriageway and needed to be pruned back. The Committee decided to
    postpone debate on this matter until its meeting in November.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Garages</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that rubbish was being dumped beyond the entrance to the garages at
    the end of River Way. The Clerk had informed CDC Environmental Health department.<br>
    <strong>Signs at Spine Road/Station Road</strong><br>
    The Clerk was to enquire from both GCC Highways and CDC Enforcement Officer if any action
    was to be taken to remove the clutter of unauthorised signs which Parish Councillors
    agreed were dangerous at this junction.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on wet rot that had decayed the top rail of the Junior Swing which
    had to be removed in the interests of safety. The top rail of the Senior Swing is also
    showing signs of decay and should be replaced immediately. Cllr Squire informed the Parish
    Council that suppliers had been asked to quote for the repairs. The Slide which, due to
    its alteration is little used, was in good condition. The chains on the basketball
    equipment had been removed. The joints of the safety tiles needed to be sealed or pushed
    together. The Cycle Mounds had been well used over the summer period but there were too
    many big stones on flat surfaces which should be removed and placed under the hedge. The
    Clerk was to ask André Genillard if he and his friends would be willing to perform this
    task especially at the jumps and berms. Generally the litter problem was improving due to
    the work done by Mr Curtis. The recent rain had resulted in a better grass growth and the
    annual weeds had been cut. A small area between the cycle mound and the football pitch
    seemed to have been missed when grass seeding had been carried out. James Harris was asked
    to inspect. Each week the situation improves.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the new play bark under the swing had been installed. The old
    goal mouth needed to be reinstated but generally litter was no longer a problem.<br>
    <strong>Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that leaves need to be swept from the safety tiles. The fencing
    has not yet been repaired although it is believed that the job is in hand.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on 6
    October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Invoices to be paid</strong><br>
    Alex Lawrie Factors Ground Maintenance South Cerney (July) £753.11<br>
    A demand threatening legal action within 7 days had been received unless a full settlement
    or reasons for withholding payment were made. The Clerk reminded Parish Councillors that
    on 28 July Cllr Stuart had complained to the ground maintenance foreman that the grass
    cutting was not up to standard. The foreman assured Cllr Stuart that the work would
    improve. The following day Cllr Stuart inspected the village again and was disappointed
    with several aspects of the contract. The foreman agreed to a telephoned invitation from
    the Clerk to attend the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields Committee meeting on 11
    August. When he failed to appear the Clerk was informed on 12 August by recorded message
    that Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd had ceased trading.<br>
    The Clerk was instructed to request that Alex Lawrie demonstrate why the Parish Council
    should pay them rather than the appointed liquidator as Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd was
    no longer in business. He was also to inform Alex Lawrie Factors that the Parish Council
    is minded to pay £500 on account.<br>

    payments totalling £8,410 to the Parochial Church Council on production of substantive
    invoices incurred in the erection of the graveyard wall extension.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>RoSPA INSPECTION</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire was not impressed with the detail provided in the safety inspection report by
    RoSPA. To comply with the Disability Discrimination Act it would be necessary to construct
    a minimum of two disabled parking bays at Upper Up car park. The Clerk was asked to
    contact GPFA for professional guidance. In the light of an inspection at Upper Up, concern
    was expressed that the inspection was of a non-dismantling nature whereby it was not
    possible to check for internal corrosion/rot without dismantling the equipment.
    Nevertheless on 13 September 2003 Cllr Stuart had visually detected that the cross over
    pole on the Junior Swing which supported the cradle swing seats was in a very dangerous,
    rotting and unsafe condition and produced photographs of its state. The RoSPA inspection
    carried out on 3 July 2003 made no mention of this potential problem. The Clerk was asked
    to inform RoSPA of the concern and to enquire why the inspector did not find the problem.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>BLEDISLOE CUP REPORT</strong><br>
    On a scale represented by A as outstanding to F well below standard the team which
    inspected South Cerney awarded the village mostly a C grade with a few B and some D marks.
    Generally the inspectors did not feel that a special effort had been made and interviews
    conducted reflected some disinterest and lack of knowledge of the competition. The Parish
    Council agreed with a suggestion from Cllr Stuart that South Cerney enters the Daily
    Telegraph and Calor Gas competition for Village of the Year Award. He emphasised that this
    competition would generate more collaboration between village residents than the Bledisloe
    Cup which he regarded as a competition for tidy villages and did not involve group
    participation.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported instances of dogs fouling the footpath from Upper Mill to Meadow Way.
    He further complained about the débris outside the shops in the area opposite the Post
    Office. The Clerk was asked to write to Mr John Jameson owner of the properties and ask
    him if wooden fencing could be erected to screen the dust bins from public view. Cllr
    Squire asked the Clerk to enquire from the County Archivist if it was possible to
    determine the ownership of the cut-through between Sudeley Drive and Ham Lane as it would
    be a benefit if steps and/or a ramp could be installed for easier access.<br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that residents of Cerney Wick had an informative meeting in their
    village hall with Marcus Kitchen Planning Officer at CDC.<br>
    The village committee had written to the Environment Agency expressing its concern about
    potential flooding. It had also written to GCC Highways with its unease about highway
    access and traffic speed by vehicles using the village roads. He asked the Clerk to
    include an item on Community Involvement in next month's agenda.<br>
    Cllr Jay had accompanied Cllr Stuart to a meeting organised by GRCC at CDC Council Chamber
    where many items including village plans were discussed and asked the Clerk to include
    this on next month's agenda. He also asked the Clerk to report the obscured lights in Bow
    Wow to Mr B. Greenaway, Road Lighting Manager at GCC.<br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report that a manhole cover in the grass verge was proud at
    end of Station Road adjacent to Kingfisher Place. Cllr Harris and Cllr Squire would
    organise a search for subterranean services where the bike racks are to be situated.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that she had attended a meeting of Cerney Wick residents and
    Marcus Kitchen CDC Planning Officer.<br>

    47. Susan Cooksley ­ Aircraft Noise at South Cerney Ms Cooksley had posed a series of
    questions of a personal nature in her letter to the Chairman. Cllr Nicholas gave an
    interpretation of how the Parish Council's Model Code of Conduct affected the issue as
    follows:<br>
    ? The Parish Council is subject to the Parish Councils' (Model Code of Conduct) Order 2001<br>
    ? A member of the Council must not conduct himself in a manner which could reasonably be
    regarded as bringing his office or the Council into disrepute [paragraph 4 of the Order].<br>
    ? A member must, if he becomes aware of any conduct by another member which he reasonably
    believes involves a failure to comply with the Code of Conduct, make a written allegation
    to that effect to the Standards Board for England as soon as it is practical for him to do
    so [paragraph 6].<br>
    ? A member must regard himself as having a personal interest in any matter if a decision
    upon it might reasonably be regarded as affecting, to a greater extent than other
    inhabitants of the Parish, the well-being or financial position of himself, a relative or
    a friend or any employment carried on by such persons [paragraph 7(1) (a)].<br>
    ? A member with a personal interest in a matter who attends a meeting at which the matter
    is considered must disclose to that meeting the existence and nature of that interest
    [paragraph 8].<br>
    ? A member with a personal interest in a matter also has a prejudicial interest in that
    matter if the interest is one which a member of the public, with knowledge of the relevant
    facts, would reasonably regard as so significant that it is likely to prejudice the
    member's judgement of the public interest [paragraph 9(1)].<br>
    ? A member with a prejudicial interest in any matter must withdraw from the room unless he
    has obtained a dispensation from the Standards Committee of the authority, and he must not
    seek improperly to influence a decision about that matter.<br>
    With regard to the question of aircraft noise from South Cerney Airfield and the interests
    of Cllr Stuart, my own interpretation of the Code of Conduct leads me to believe as
    follows:-<br>
    1. I have always been aware that Cllr Stuart's wife is employed as a secretary at the army
    camp, but I am not aware of precisely who she works for there.<br>
    2. It is my understanding that all the other Parish Councillors are similarly aware of
    that fact, and Cllr Stuart has always been perfectly open and honest about it in all
    discussions about aircraft noise.<br>
    3. The definition of a personal interest refers to any matter that affects the individual
    concerned to a greater extent than any other inhabitants of the area I do not believe that
    the question of aircraft noise actually affects Mrs Stuart to any greater extent than
    anyone else in the village, but since Mrs Stuart also works at the camp, I err on the side
    of caution on this question, and I am assuming that there is a personal interest here
    under the Code.<br>
    4. I do not know whether paragraph 8 of the Code requires that such a personal interest be
    expressly minuted, but it is my belief that Cllr Stuart has effectively disclosed his
    particular personal interest to the Council, and therefore I do not believe that there has
    been a breach of the Code in this regard. Nevertheless, I think it would be prudent to
    minute every such disclosure of a personal interest in the future.<br>
    5. I believe the question of current levels of aircraft noise, arose because the Parish
    Council had been asked to submit representations in order to reflect the views of village
    residents. I am mindful of the fact that the Parish Council actually has no direct
    influence regarding the nature or extent of aircraft activity, and that the question at
    issue here is merely the nature of any representations submitted by the Council.<br>
    6. Ever since the aircraft noise question arose, I have been mindful of whether Cllr
    Stuart's personal interest might amount to a prejudicial interest. I believe that, whilst
    obviously expressing his own personal views on the matter, Cllr Stuart has chaired the
    debates which I have attended in an even-handed manner, and that the letter that he
    drafted [which was sent to Major Jones on 12th July 2003] is very fair and reasonable.
    Indeed, the letter is a clear demonstration that Cllr Stuart's personal interest should
    not reasonably be regarded as so significant as to prejudice his judgement of the public
    interest.<br>
    7. Whilst I personally do object somewhat to the current aircraft noise, I believe that
    both the said letter, and Cllr Stuart's chairmanship of the discussions, accurately
    reflects the more general opinion of village residents, namely that they broadly accept
    the current level of aircraft activity, having regard to the history of the airfield and
    the quasi military nature of the Silver Stars Parachute Team.<br>
    8. I am fully mindful of the fact that, as a member of the Parish Council, the Code of
    Conduct requires me to make a written allegation to the Standards Board if I become aware
    of any conduct by another member which I reasonably believe involves a failure to comply
    with the Code.<br>
    Having carefully considered the matter in the manner detailed above, I personally do not
    believe that Cllr Stuart has breached the Code. Nevertheless, every other member of the
    Council must obviously consider the question, and should satisfy themselves on this, and
    every single other issue that the Parish Council chooses to address.<br>
    Finally, I believe that not only should the Parish Council continue to satisfy itself that
    the Code of Conduct is adhered to at all times, but we should always be clearly seen to do
    so. For that reason, I think it important that we continue to publish full minutes of our
    meetings on the Parish Council website, and that we also publish any letters that we write
    in response to such public debates in the future. Cllr Caunce proposed and Cllr Jay
    seconded a motion that the Parish Council stands in full agreement with the analysis given
    by Cllr Nicholas. The Parish Council was unanimously in favour of the motion. The Parish
    Council then agreed that there was nothing new to discuss regarding aircraft noise and all
    Parish Councillors personally thanked Cllr Nicholas for his contribution. The Clerk was
    asked to forward a copy of the above assessment to Ms Cooksley.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Squire closed the meeting at 10.45pm. </td>
