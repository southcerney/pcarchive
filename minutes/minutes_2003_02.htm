    <td>There were two members of the public present.<br>
    The Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30pm.<p><strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC).<br>
    <strong>Local Plan Opening Meeting</strong><br>
    Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart on behalf of Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner thanked Cllr Nicholas
    for chairing the open meeting held on Friday 7 February which discussed the Local Plan.
    The Parish Council concurred.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 8 JANUARY 2003</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Dunn that the Minutes were a true
    and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by
    Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    Matters arising would be discussed when the Chairmen of the Committees made their reports.
    The Clerk then reported on his actions over the previous month.<br>
    All payments to suppliers were dispatched and response forms faxed to CDC. On 9 January I
    accepted delivery of the new public seat and arranged its transportation and storage to
    Cllr R. Gardiner at The Cottage, South Cerney. After several broken promises to repair the
    noticeboard from the person responsible for the vandalism I have informed him that if the
    work is not completed by the week ending 15 February the Parish Council will use another
    supplier to complete the job. I have kept the Police informed of each disappointment and
    also this latest threat to have the job done by someone else. Sgt Smith at Cirencester
    offered to make the incident file available to the Parish Council if it decides to recover
    the cost incurred from the culprit.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Road Safety Improvements</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the speed detector which had been loaned by GCC Highways had
    been a very successful exercise. The Clerk was to thank Mr John Whittaker, Cotswold
    Traffic Manager for its use and ask for a copy of the statistics which it had recorded. Mr
    Whittaker was to be informed that the Safety Pack had not been received from Gary Handley
    GCC Road Safety Officer and a costed plan for improvements was awaited.<br>
    <strong>Cinema Licence Fee</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the licence had been received valid from 1 January 2003 at no
    charge for 12 months.<br>
    <strong>Golf Balls</strong><br>
    Mrs Spriggs reported that stray golf balls were still causing problems on the public
    footpath adjacent to the golf course although warning signs had been erected to caution
    users of the footpath. Cllr Nicholas said that the Golf Club cannot disclaim liability
    just by erecting warning signs. Cllr Jones (CDC) thought that by allowing this activity
    the Golf Club might be in breach of a Planning Condition. The Clerk was asked to write to
    CDC Planning to enquire if there was a breach of any Planning Condition, inform the
    Environmental Health at CDC and also Phil Cluely GCC PROW officer of the problem. Cllr
    Dunn had yet to contact officials at the Golf Club.<br>
    <strong>Blocked Surface Water Drain on Cirencester Road</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that one of the four drains on Cirencester Road near to the Talland
    riding school was still blocked and asked the Clerk to inform D. Taylor GCC Highways.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 10
    February.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    CT.3930/D<br>
    The Clerk requested CDC Planning to supply the Section 106 agreement details which applied
    to this application.<br>
    CT.8163/D<br>
    The Clerk informed Cllr Stuart that he had reported to the Enforcement Officer at CDC the
    alleged increase in permitted height of the wall at Orchard House. Mr Grace stated the
    height of the wall breached the permitted planning condition and he had informed Mrs Lloyd
    accordingly that either the wall be reduced in height to comply with the permission or
    retrospective planning approval be applied for its increase. The Parish Council recommends
    that CDC be requested to ensure that any decision on this retrospective planning
    application should be decided at Committee and not left to delegated powers. Cllr Stuart
    also asked the Clerk to report that a further 10 (ten) blocks had been added to the length
    of the wall in the direction of High Street which he suspected was also in breach of the
    granted permission.<br>
    CT.2475/1/L<br>
    Mr Lawson told the Committee that he was concerned with the current activity on this site
    which was being cleared by ground workers in preparation for development. The Committee
    told Mr Lawson that the work was probably in order with granted outline planning
    permission but nevertheless assured him that careful surveillance would be kept on its
    progress and any subsequent application for full planning permission.<br>
    <br>

    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to ratify its decision on
    CT.4630/P. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications Granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.2249/E<br>

    Permitted Development) Order 1995, or any other statutory instrument amending or replacing

    dwelling, other than those permitted by this Decision Notice.<br>
    Reason: It is important to ensure that the amenity of occupiers of neighbouring dwelling
    is preserved. In order to protect these qualities, it is essential for the Local Planning
    Authority to maintain control over the types of development listed above, in accordance
    with Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 44.<br>
    The Committee was of the opinion that to enable the Parish Council to police conditions
    attached to all granted planning applications it would be helpful to have speedy access to
    any enquiry regarding specific conditions at its meetings. The Clerk suggested that a lap
    top computer provided by the Parish Council for such purposes could give an instant recall
    to queries raised on the content of Decision Notices and other matters.<br>
    <br>
    CT.3704/H<br>

    it, no new openings shall be erected, constructed or inserted in the extension hereby
    permitted other than those permitted by this Decision Notice.<br>
    Reason: It is important that the amenity of neighbouring properties is maintained. In

    District Local Plan Policy 44.<br>
    <br>
    CT.8276<br>
    Erection of one dwelling at land adjoining Dryft Cottage, Station Road,<br>
    South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>

    constrained plot.</p>

    Due to the absence of Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Nicholas Vice Chairman of the Finance
    Committee reported on the deliberations of the Committee which had met on 10 February.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    Response from Audit Commission<br>
    The Clerk reported that no reply had been received.<br>

    <br>

    to aid the production of the Village Directory. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cerney News Donation</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform the Cerney News editor, Mrs J. Squire that its offer of
    £100 to subsidise the publication of charitable articles including advertising was well
    intentioned.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Payments Out</strong><br>

    Cllr Mrs Gardiner had inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for January.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Parish Council
    agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ground Maintenance Contracts</strong><br>
    Although four replies from potential contractors had been received one was still awaited.
    The Parish Council agreed on the Clerk's recommendation to make its decision at its
    meeting in March.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment Quotations</strong><br>
    Three quotes had been received to reinstate the car park. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart
    and seconded by Cllr Harris that the contract be awarded to A. P. Transport which had
    provided the lowest quotation. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Trees on the Piece</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest and left the Committee room. In the absence of any
    further quotes being received for trees and hedge maintenance on the Piece the Parish
    Council had no option but to consider James Harris Contracting, which had quoted £490,
    for the work. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr King that James Harris
    Contracting be awarded the contract. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Internal Audit</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner carried out an internal audit on the Parish Council's accounts which she
    had proclaimed satisfactory.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 10 February.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Ramp</strong><br>
    Mrs Roberts pointed out that the width of the ramp at its entrance/exit was inadequate to
    accommodate wheelchairs. The half landing on the ramp was too narrow for a wheelchair to
    make the turn necessary to access the slope. Mrs Roberts was supported in her claims by
    the 15th Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon. She requested that a meeting be arranged with D.
    Taylor before the roadside barriers were erected and was prepared to attend such a meeting
    in her wheelchair to determine whether the barriers would hinder wheelchair access to the
    ramp.<br>
    <strong>Preaching Cross</strong><br>
    Mrs Roberts complained that although there was a drop kerb opposite the Preaching Cross
    there was no drop kerb to enter the island and if accessed the path thereon was too narrow
    for her wheelchair and its width needed to be increased.<br>
    <strong>Footpath Delineation</strong><br>
    Mrs Roberts alluded to the lack of a footpath marking between the entrance to the public
    right of way serving Churn Close from Clarks Hay in front of the garage and alongside the
    cedar tree on the opposite site. She complained that vehicles regularly parked on the
    footpath forcing pedestrians and disabled users alike onto the carriageway to get by.<br>
    <strong>Public Rights of Way</strong><br>
    Mrs Roberts mentioned several rights of way which were difficult for the disabled to use
    because of the various obstacles erected to prevent unauthorised use by motorbikes and
    asked for support to persuade GCC PROW to redesign the entrances to these walks possibly
    in partnership with the Parish Council. Cllr Harris explained that traps on some footpaths
    were necessary to deter their abuse. Cllr Harris recommended that the kissing gate on the
    footpath from Church Lane to Bow Wow be replaced with a more user friendly type and the
    footpath from Silver Street to Robert Franklin Way and Station Road might be better served
    by a gate operated with a radar key. This footpath along the disused railway line was part
    of Sustrans Route 45 and could be eligible for funding. Mrs Roberts suggested that the
    kissing gate might be replaced by memorial gates to which interested residents may
    possibly contribute. Mrs Roberts referred to three other footpaths she would eventually
    like to see upgraded: (a) Station Road Lake 16 to Cricklade; (b) Ham Lane across Lake 16
    to car park at the railway arches on the Spine Road; (c) Bow Wow, Crane Farm to the Thames
    and Severn Canal on the Spine Road. Cllr King suggested that a survey of all local
    footpaths be carried out. Cllr Nicholas said with this information it would be possible to
    prioritise any action. The Clerk was asked to contact Mrs Roberts and suggest that she
    might like to complete such a survey.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Play Equipment</strong><br>
    Cllr King thanked Cllr Harris and Cllr Nicholas for helping out with the outline plan.
    Cllr King then explained his sub committee's efforts in acquiring the play equipment. He
    suggested that the equipment be sited on Robert Franklin Way playing field and produced an
    outline plan of where it might be erected. The Clerk has ascertained that planning
    permission would be necessary if the apparatus was over 4 metres high or exceeded 200m3
    capacity. Further to the equipment donation from Le Spa, Gloucestershire Playing Fields
    Association had been instrumental in enabling the Parish Council to obtain a further item
    of refurbished apparatus from HAGS for £4,500 which would include its installation but
    not the associated safety surface. The overall Parish Council budget allowed £21,000 of
    which £17,000 would be needed for the first phase which included the installation of Le
    Spa equipment with its associated safety tiles and the HAGS apparatus. Cllr King estimated
    that overall the cost of the project would be in the region of £36,500, 50% of which
    could be financed through grants. Due to business commitments Cllr King said that he would
    be prepared to act as Project Manager for the scheme although he would be unable to pursue
    the necessary grants and asked that another Parish Councillor or member of the public
    volunteer to manage this. The Parish Council agreed that a Village Project Grants
    co-ordinator be sought through the Cerney News to work alongside the Parish Council and
    other village organisations with reasonable expenses paid. Cllr Jones (CDC) informed the
    Parish Council that the CDC was minded to reinstate the Community Fund to an amount of
    £500,000 over three years from 1 April.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Bollards</strong><br>
    The set of bollards in Station Road had been removed and the set in High Street improved.<br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    There had been no further contact with Barry Greenaway on this matter.<br>
    <strong>Seat at Limes</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported that two seats had been delivered and the Clerk would arrange for
    the surplus seat to be uplifted. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr
    King that £100 be allowed for the installation of the seat by the Limes. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Tree Survey</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart carried out the tree survey on 12 January. Cllr Gardiner had
    apologised for his absence. From the survey Cllr Stuart will present a work schedule and
    consider its cost to the Parish Council at its next meeting in March.<br>
    <strong>Sub Station at Limes</strong><br>
    An apologetic reply had been received from Bell Contracting Ltd regarding the fitting of
    the door to the sub-station, work on which will be carried out shortly. Bell Contracting
    Ltd insisted that they were not responsible for the sub-station roof or ventilation
    louvres and the grass-crete track has been laid correctly as per site drawings and
    standard details to the satisfaction of Westbury Homes.<br>
    <strong>Football Wall at Upper Up</strong><br>
    The Parish Council was minded to erect a football wall at the rear of the tennis court on
    Upper Up playing field and the Clerk was asked to obtain suitable plans from GPFA for its
    construction.<br>
    <strong>Maintenance Repairs</strong><br>
    James Harris Contracting had replaced the broken fence rail at Upper Up car park,
    redesigned the stile at Robert Franklin Way and fixed the hand rail to the bridge over the
    culvert at Cerney Wick play area. Cllr Gardiner had replaced two seats on the swings at
    Upper Up playing field but was unable to restore those in Cerney Wick through lack of
    necessary equipment. The Clerk was to ask MacVenture Play Co to quote for their
    replacement.<br>
    <strong>Noticeboard</strong><br>
    After numerous promises of action the Clerk reported that the noticeboard had still not
    been repaired. One quote had been received from R.O.W. Berry for its repair.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported on her inspections. At Upper Up safety tiles were lifting, the
    chain was broken on the basketball goal and there was some litter about. The car park was
    very messy with numerous potholes and there was a lot of rubble at the top end of the
    playing field. At Robert Franklin Way the bark under the swing needs replacing, nails were
    protruding at the top of the slide and the surface was slippery. The football area was a
    bit muddy and there was some litter about. In Cerney Wick the safety surface was slippery
    under the swing and climbing frame. There was polythene débris in the back hedge, some
    litter about and the bin needed to be emptied. Cllr Harris had made the nails on the slide
    safe and the Clerk was asked to contact MacVenture Play Co and ask him to quote to remove
    the algae from the safety tiles in Cerney Wick. Cllr Harris will carry out the inspections
    in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>LOCAL PLAN</strong><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to make the following objections and recommendations to the
    Local Plan 2001­2011 First Deposit. Policies 20, 26, 36, 47 and 49; Paragraph 9.20; Inset
    Map 9<br>
    <strong>Objection:</strong><br>
    South Cerney Parish Council considers it a glaring omission that no mention has been made
    regarding the future of the CAMAS site that was the subject of the recent planning appeal.
    In paragraph c.27 of his Report to the First Secretary of State, Mr David Lavender stated:
    &quot;. . . the future of the site would be more appropriately considered in the Local
    Plan Review process. This would enable the balance between employment and housing to be
    more systematically appraised, and the precise needs of the village for additional or
    enhanced recreational and commercial facilities identified.&quot; The Appeal site
    comprises 10.3 hectares of land and is presently used for industrial purposes; presumably
    planning permission for change of use would not be needed if the site was to be re-used
    for industrial purposes. The designated industrial/employment land in South Cerney is
    already acknowledged as the second largest in the Cotswold District; the adjoining
    residential areas of the village would be overwhelmed by more industrial and/or employment
    use on this site.<br>
    <strong>Recommendation:</strong><br>
    Paragraph 9.18 should expressly acknowledge that, for a large settlement with an above
    average proportion of younger people, there is a notable shortage of youth amenities. The
    Parish Council suggests that the whole of the CAMAS site, and also the wooded area
    immediately to the east of it, and the lakeside area and the proposed bridlepath route
    (along its north western shore of Lake 16) be considered as a public amenity land and/or
    open space, and that it should be specifically designated for community purposes in the

    on the village, which will only get worse as use of the large areas of designated
    employment land in South Cerney intensifies.<br>

    <strong>RISK ASSESSMENT</strong><br>
    To avoid risk to Parish Council electronic records the Clerk was asked to safeguard a copy
    of its files which will be stored in Village Hall. To protect the Clerk's computer it was
    agreed that he investigates how much an anti virus program would cost. Such a program, if
    purchased, would be registered in the Parish Council's name.<br>
    <br>

    weekends being used for flying, no flying on Bank Holidays and on sensitive days (eg
    Easter Sunday) and limited flying hours.<br>
    The Parish Council was in full agreement with Cllr Stuart when he recommended that to

    <strong>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Jones (CDC) reiterated his earlier statement on the reinstatement of the Community
    Fund. He informed the Parish Council that the District Council will meet at the end of
    February to agree a likely 9% increase in its Council Tax. A Conservation Area Statement
    will be published on the CDC web site soon.<br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart reported that the green plastic exteriors of the rubbish bins
    at the Preaching Cross and the end of Bow Wow by Lower Mill were missing.<br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart reported that the BT manhole cover outside Gable Cottage in
    Silver Street presented a severe trip hazard.<br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart reported that a tree in Bow Wow on the southern side near the
    footbridge on land owned by Mr R. Webb was in a dangerous condition. Cllr Mrs Chubb was
    asked to inform Mr Webb that action was necessary to avert this danger.<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the wall facing Station Road belonging to Boxbush Farm is
    leaning out towards the footpath and excess ivy growing on it was forcing pedestrians off
    the footpath. Cllr Mrs Chubb accepted that it was a problem and she would see what could
    be done to remedy the situation. Cllr Harris reported that there was no street sign for
    the Lakeside development.<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the speed detector which had been loaned by GCC Highways had
    been a very successful exercise. The Clerk was to thank Mr John Whittaker, Cotswold
    Traffic Manager for its use and ask for a copy of the statistics which it had recorded
    compared with the pneumatic sensors. Cllr Harris was impressed with the speed reduction
    system in place at the entrance to Poulton from the Cirencester direction which had
    reducing signs every 100 metres until the restricted zone was entered.<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the area at the base of the embankment near to the site of the
    old Tin Bridge in Silver Street needs reinstatement although he acknowledged that it would
    be difficult to find out who was responsible for its present condition.<br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported that Mr Chris Francis had asked for written permission from the
    Parish Council to lay the tarmac in Boxbush Road. The Clerk would oblige.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pearse had asked that the Clerk enquire if there were any further developments
    regarding the opening of BSC11 by Walnut Farm. the Clerk reported that he had contacted
    Bob Hawkin at GCC Highway records who had informed him that an objection to the
    Modification Order had been received from Mr Hayward. The file was now in a queue at GCC
    to be forwarded to the Secretary of State who would either determine it or put it to a
    Public Enquiry for resolution.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman complained of the débris left by vehicle traffic on the Spine Road,
    especially at its junction with Cerney Wick Lane and in the adjacent traffic islands. The
    Clerk was asked to notify D. Taylor, GCC Highways.<br>
    The Clerk reported a concern raised by Mrs J. Townsend, Parish Administrator that
    agreements made with the current Parish Council concerning the funding of the graveyard
    wall extension would be honoured by its successor. Cllr Bride pointed out in September
    1999 that the current Parish Council had no authority to commit a future Parish Council to
    ongoing expenditure. Research by Cllr Dunn, minuted in July 2002, determined that the
    Parish Council was ultimately responsible for the provision of a churchyard and it was in
    the interest of the Parish Council to provide funding for the wall extension and both
    parties legal fees in the transfer of the land to be provided by Lady Fanshawe because if
    the Parish Council did not take advantage of the situation it would be obliged to purchase
    new land for burials when the existing churchyard reached capacity.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 10.35pm. </td>
