    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 14th May 2008</strong>.</p>

At 7pm Cllr Stuart welcomed Julie Bartram, Young Gloucestershire Youth Work Manager
and Emily Whitehead a facilitator with Young Gloucestershire to the meeting. Julie and
Emily gave a 15 minute presentation on how the charity Young Gloucestershire interacted
within the community primarily setting up centres for youth activities which would progress
to self administration under the guidance of the parent organisation. One of its projects was
to prepare people in the age range 16–25 to take part in the Princes Trust. Emily explained
that their plan was to work with young people at the start of school term with a brain
storming session to decide on a program of events. Groups are usually divided into 11–13
and 14–16 year olds. When feasible it was intended to work with children from the travelling
community. Established clubs will eventually be run by volunteers, supported by the Charity.
Cllr Jay enquired if the Charity had the support of GCC. Julie Bartram replied that Young
Gloucestershire worked closely with the county Youth Provision service and had operated in
the Cotswolds for 40 years partially supported by GCC. Cllr Harris asked if the operation
would continue through the summer period as it was his experience that during this time
interest waned. Emily Whitehead confirmed that it was the intention to operate throughout
the year although it would depend on the availability of staff. Emily replied positively to Cllr
Stuart who asked if the charity liaised with Claire Dowan (CDC) and currently a meeting
was being arranged with the Youth Parish Council. Cllr Jay asked if Young Gloucestershire
had any request to make from the Parish Council. Julie Bartram was grateful for the £2,000
donated recently and confirmed that the sum had been matched funded from St. James’
Place, Cirencester. Cllr Nicholas stated that if the group needed the help of the Parish
Council they should not hesitate to ask for assistance. Emily was very enthusiastic in
describing the activities of the youth in South Cerney and complimented the quality of the
participants. Cllr Stuart thanked both ladies for attending the meeting and they left the room
at 7.30pm.<br>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 24th April I attended a meeting of the 
 Chartered Parishes Group at Shire Hall, Gloucester. The main item on the agenda 
 was the initiative to provide centres to promote the well being of children and 
 families in the county. Phase 3 of the project is now being implemented. 
 Centres are mostly provided in the larger urban areas due to the greater 
 density of young families and relative deprivation experienced. In 2006 eight 
 centres in areas of most disadvantage were opened. Phase 2 which concluded in 
 March 2008 saw the opening of a further 23 centres. Nine more centres are 
 planned in Phase 3 making a total of 40 county wide by March 2010. The centres 
 provide outreach services to isolated families; advice and information about 
 parenting; childcare and education services; support to child-minders; 
 activities for children and their parents/carers such as stay and play or drop 
 in sessions; links with Job Centre Plus; access to community health services 
 including antenatal and child health promotion programmes. Phase 3 centres will 
 provide improved access to services for families living in less disadvantaged 
 and more affluent areas. It is recognised that even in more affluent areas 
 there will be small pockets of children who may be at risk of social exclusion 
 because of their isolation and these children and their families must be able 
 to access the full range of services. Chris Rogan, Head of Gloucestershire 
 Highways gave an update on the activities of the service including the progress 
 of clearing and surveying gulleys in the county especially those in areas 
 affected by the floods of July 2007 and January 2008. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During April of the 16 available working days I averaged 3 
 hours 55 minutes per day which is approximately 20 minutes more per day than my 
 contract but acceptable.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 12th MAY</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart, Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker attended the meeting. Cllr 
 Caunce had opened the meeting at 7.05pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path from Station Road to Huxley Court</b>
 <br>

 Industries) answering machine and also his mobile but had not received any 
 reply. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported good progress in his negotiations with Spencer Coxon over 
 the refurbishment of the car park. He is hopeful that Richard Maggs will 
 confirm arrangements on his return from holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bore Hole Lease</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that he was still in negotiations with the Environment 
 Agency regarding an increase of rent based on the conditions of the original 
 lease. </p>

 (01285 623613) to contact if the bin was full.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Brook House Parking</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris assured members of the Committee that he had witnessed the extent 
 of the deeds to Brook House which included the parking area to the front. He 
 had contacted Mr Pasco Genillard who explained that the deeds were now lodged 
 elsewhere but he would endeavour to produce a copy.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Canal Sign</b> <br>
 Parish Councillors had been unable to find the sign denoting the line of the

 Cllr Caunce reported on his negotiations with Tim Bryant who had successfully 
 quoted for removing the turf, rolling and stacking it on pallets to be supplied 
 by Murphy contractors. Cllr Caunce also reported that he had received email 
 confirmation from Spencer Coxon that Murphy’s would purchase the material. The 
 Committee was in full agreement. At the PC meeting Cllr Caunce confirmed that 
 Mr Bryant would remove the turf on 5th June and he had arranged with Mr Coxon 
 to supply the pallets. When Cllr Stuart and Cllr Harris came to mark out the 
 area it was discovered there was an underground cable on part of the site which 
 meant that the width of the area had to be reduced from 15 metres to 13 metres.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that replacement notices were needed. Brambles at the

 will inform Mr Ian Fairbrother, Chairman of Cerney Wick Village Committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up<br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reported that the ground maintenance contractors had damaged 
 the safety surface in the vicinity of the Activity area which had been scalped 
 by the mower when cutting the grass alongside. The damage is in the identical 
 place to last year. The Clerk was asked to inform Glebe Contractors and ask 
 them for their comments. Cllr Stuart reported that a concrete post supporting 
 the chain link fence had been damaged. Two quotations for its repair had been 
 received. Work was being carried out on the cycle mounds by Murphy contractors 
 following negotiations with the users. The surface of the car park is 
 deteriorating badly. Reinstatement of surfaces over the line of the new 
 pipework is proceeding.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the fan shaped top step of the Adventure Unit on the 
 playing field needed to be replaced with 17mm-20mm phenolic ply. Four 
 contractors would be asked to quote. Nettles in the area will need to be 
 monitored and when necessary sprayed later in the season. Litter was not a 
 problem.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bank to the front of Century House, Silver Street <br>
 </b>The Committee recommends that the quotation from Glebe Contractors is 
 accepted. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Turf on MUGA Area</b> <br>
 Tim Bryant had produced a quote to remove the turf, roll and place it on 
 pallets for collection from the MUGA site. On behalf of the Parish Council, 
 Cllr Caunce had negotiated an acceptable fee from Murphy contractors for the 
 turf. The Committee recommends this deal in its entirety. </p>

 reinstatement carried out by Murphy contractors in the vicinity of the pumping 
 station in Robert Franklin Way. The Clerk was to ask Gillian Portlock to 
 inspect and confirm if the work was satisfactory. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that work on the reinstatement of the 
 Upper Up humps and bumps is scheduled to begin on Wednesday 28th May. He would 
 inform the users of the need to attend a safety briefing at 9am on that day if 
 they wished to access the site during the work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Caunce that 
 a task list of outstanding items is introduced. This would comprise columns to 
 (a) describe the task, (b) determine the action required and (c) 
 responsibility. It would accompany the committee agenda each month.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported an email he had received from Dr 
 Phoebe Carter, Biodiversity Field Officer at the Cotswold Water Park Society 
 regarding a survey of water voles and otters in the river Churn. She had 
 enquired if the names and addresses of local landowners whose property bordered

 was attending hospital. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the first spread sheet of the period 
 gave a distorted picture although understandable, particularly regarding 
 professional fees and the cost of employing the Clerk.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Recommendations of the Playing Fields and Village

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas would like to start a dialogue with Ann 
 Edwards School in how to promote a scheme to encourage safer routes to school. 
 Cllr Walker will keep Cllr Nicholas informed. The Village Plan highlighted 
 strategies such as item 3 to Promote healthier routes to school and item 6 to 
 improve road safety in the villages and monitor the condition of the roads and 
 pavements which would encompass the proposals. The Clerk was asked to include 
 this as an agenda item for the June meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb was concerned at the manner in which a local 
 estate agent was advertising the sale of lodges on Lake 15 which should only be 
 sold to fishermen engaged in that sport. Parish Councillors agreed that it 
 would be difficult to police individuals’ activities as to whether or not they 
 complied with the planning conditions. Cllr Stuart stated that it was a case of 
 ‘caveat emptor’ or let the buyer beware. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay would like SITA to clear all litter bins prior to 
 the Street Fair on Monday 26th May and also on the following day to help deal 
 with the consequent surfeit of litter which is expected. The Clerk will inform 
 Mike Harris (CDC) of this request. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) informed the Parish Council that the 
 recent introduction of new waste and recycling collections were in his words 
 “going brilliantly” where the project had been rolled out.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated that he had arranged for the 
 footpath alongside the garage in Clarks Hay to be inspected by Gloucestershire 
 PROW officers. Once it was decided where the footpath was to be, he predicted 
 that the garage manager would paint the delineation to denote its existence. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) informed the Parish Council that PCSO 
 Lesley Pooley had been moved to Lechlade and PCSO Michael Owen had replaced 
 her. Cllr Stuart was disturbed that no discussion had taken place with the 
 police prior to this decision and he would raise the matter at the next Parish 
 Neighbourhood meeting scheduled for the 16th April. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked that the flooding which regularly 
 happened outside the property known as the Barn in Cerney Wick be investigated. 
 She suspected that the drain was blocked and needed to be cleared. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report to Gillian Portlock 
 at Gloucestershire Highways that the weeds at the crossroads near Crossroads 
 Farm, beyond Upper Up needed to be strimmed back as they were probably the 
 cause of an accident which had occurred there recently. He was also concerned 
 about some orange netting which was obscuring the sight lines at the next 
 junction although this was in the neighbouring parish of Somerford Keynes. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart added that GRCC had enquired how the Parish 
 Council was progressing with the implementation of its Village Plan. Cllr Webb 
 and Cllr Stuart would attend a meeting on Tuesday 20th May at the behest of 
 GRCC to encourage other villages to create plans of their own. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had attended a Village Forum 
 meeting organised by Marilyn Cox (GRCC) on 22nd April at Yanworth. On 27th 
 April he had represented the Parish Council at the induction of the new vicar 
 Revd David Bowers at All Hallows parish church. Katherine Isles and Mandy Fry 
 had asked that various groups throughout the village support the production of 
 a village calendar for 2009. Cllr Stuart suggested that members of the Parish 
 Council and the Village Hall Committee could pose for photographs outside the 
 Village Hall. Agreement by Parish Councillors to this was not universal as some 
 thought it pretentious although the concept of a calendar was supported. Cllr 
 Stuart will relay the acquiescence of Parish Councillors to the ladies. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As there was no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 9.05pm.</p>
