    <br>
    The Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Dunn, Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr
    Jones (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>SOUTH CERNEY SAILING CLUB</strong><br>
    Commodore Paul Talbot and Andrew Martin Membership Secretary of the South Cerney Sailing
    Club explained the plans the club had for their new clubhouse and facilities. Mr Martin
    informed the Parish Council that the club had negotiated a 99 year lease from Watermark
    who had been very helpful. The club had great hopes that a lottery grant would be awarded
    but was not taking it for granted. The outcome of the grant application was expected by
    the end of July. If the grant was not forthcoming a contingency plan for a smaller scheme
    would then be put into operation. He then showed Parish Councillors proposed plans which
    the club would be presenting to CDC for planning permission. Although currently there were
    20 members from the South Cerney area out of more than 400 the club was actively
    encouraging more local members evidenced by an information stall at the recent Street Fair
    and a mail shot directed at local residents. The club would welcome the support of the
    Parish Council when other grants are applied for. Cllr Stuart said that the presentation
    was a valuable contribution which would help the Parish Council make a decision, when
    necessary, whether to support the club. Mr Talbot and Mr Martin left the meeting at
    7.50pm.<br>

    invited Mr &amp; Mrs Smith,<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Gardiner that the Minutes as amended,
    were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were
    signed by the Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Burial Authority</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas stated that the Parish Council needed to know which statutory body was
    responsible for the graveyard. Cllr Dunn, who was elected to the Burial Authority at the
    last meeting, would be asked to inform the Parish Council at its meeting in July.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 10
    June<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Appeal by Westbury Homes</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas who had attended the appeal hearing for four days reported that on balance
    it had been a worthwhile exercise. He summarised proceedings outlining opposing barristers
    opening statements. He then explained in detail Section 106 Agreements which would be
    binding on the developers if the appeal was successful. He encouraged Parish Councillors
    to attend the appeal on 14 June at 9am when barristers on behalf of CDC and Westbury Homes
    would make their concluding statements. Cllr Mrs Gardiner said that the Parish Council
    owed Cllr Nicholas a debt of gratitude for the time he spent both prior to and at the
    appeal on behalf of the Parish Council. Cllr Harris agreed that the Parish Council was
    indebted to Cllr Nicholas for the time and energy he had spent leading up to and at the
    appeal. Cllr Harris proposed and Cllr Stuart seconded a vote of thanks. The Parish Council
    was all in favour. Cllr Mrs Spriggs personally thanked Cllr Nicholas for his fair
    rendition of the differing opinions of the Parish Council but criticised his abbreviated
    version of the minority Parish Council opinion and lack of consultation in its
    composition. Cllr Nicholas defended his actions and refuted the criticism explaining that
    only matters of material consideration were of importance in the statement. Cllr Mrs
    Spriggs further complained that Cllr Nicholas had not honoured, what she described as a
    gentlemen's agreement, to discuss the content of the minority opinion in the statement to
    the appeal. Cllr Nicholas said that this was an oversight but he considered that the
    wording fairly explained the differing opinions.<br>
    <br>
    Planning Applications received by Cotswold District Council<br>
    <br>
    CT.3115/E<br>
    Erection of a dwelling and garage at Plot 2, land off Meadow Way, South Cerney.<br>
    As CDC required that views on the application should be made by 30 May 2002 the Planning
    Committee decided to object and request that the Parish Council ratifies their decision.<br>
    The proposal represents very significant departures from the details of the plans that
    were approved at the appeal for this and adjoining sites. It includes first floor windows
    in the southern elevation which would intrude on the privacy of the cottages to the south.
    It changes it from a 3 bedroom to a 4 bedroom property, creating extra windows in the
    southern elevation. It also appears to move the house southward, resulting in an increase
    in the intrusion on privacy to the south. The plans submitted for and approved by the
    appeal were very careful to minimise overlooking the existing cottages to the south. This
    proposal fundamentally overturns that careful desirable intent. Mr Beard complained that
    procedural errors at CDC had meant that some amendments had been approved contrary to the
    objectives of the successful appeal which had been granted permission and that he had not
    been kept informed by the District Council. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would investigate the
    matter at the District Council.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas proposed and Cllr Gardiner seconded a proposal that the Parish Council
    ratify the decision the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    (GPFA) to determine how to solve the finger entrapment and access problems on the tower
    slide. Mrs Gibson suggested that the platform be boarded over and a scramble type net at
    an angle to the frame be installed for access. She also recommended that a bar be set one
    third of the way down in the frame at the mouth of the slide to help children launch
    themselves on the shute. The Clerk was asked to enquire from Wicksteed Leisure what a net
    would cost and any recommendations they might have to provide a safer access to the
    platform.<br>
    <br>
    Traffic Bollards<br>
    A reply had been received from I. Coggon, Principal Area Manager, Development
    Co-ordination at GCC Highways requesting that the Parish Council supports the siting of
    the bollards for road safety reasons and to continue to monitor the situation after the
    proposed white lining had been laid. He reminded the Parish Council that the developer's
    scheme for works on the public highway had been fully discussed prior to implementation
    and had received the support of the Parish Council. Minutes from April 2000 confirmed that
    the Parish Council was in favour of traffic calming measures but that the proposed traffic
    islands in Station Road and High Street were not suitable. The Clerk was asked to reply to
    Mr Coggon accordingly.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb had carried out the inspections over the previous five week period. She
    reported an accumulation of litter at Upper Up and Robert Franklin Way which had been
    exacerbated by recent grass cutting. The litter bins alongside the fence at Upper Up and
    near to the entrance at Robert Franklin Way needed to be emptied. The safety tiles at
    Upper Up and Cerney Wick were once again showing signs of lifting but as yet were not a
    hazard. Cllr Mrs Chubb considered that the safety tiles at Cerney Wick were too slippery
    and needed to be cleaned off. One rail on the fence had been dislodged and redundant posts
    which had nails protruding had been left near to the gate. Cllr Mrs Chapman would inform
    Mr I. Fairbrother of Chairman of Cerney Wick Village Hall Committee. However, the play
    area at Cerney Wick was very tidy and there was no sign of any litter. Cllr Harris will
    carry out the inspections in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    Litter picker<br>
    The Parish Council agreed in principle to employ a litter picker on a part time basis to
    cope with the permanent problem of litter at the play areas and throughout the village.
    Cllr Stuart and Cllr Harris will contact Mr E. Curtis to determine whether he would be
    willing to do the job.<br>

    to see if he would arrange to clear away rubbish which was accumulating in Gypsy Lane.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had met with Martin Portus, Peter Smith and Karen Birt from Creoda to reassure
    the preferred tenderers on the terms of the contract. Cllr Harris would call a meeting of
    the sub-committee to discuss fund raising and how to finance the project. In reply to a
    question from Cllr Stuart, Cllr Harris expected CDC to approve the planning application in
    due course.<br>

    item to the agenda for next month's meeting<br>

    <br>
    <br>

    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the hole outside Oakbeams in Station Road had reappeared and
    asked the Clerk to report the incident to D. Taylor at GCC Highways.<br>
    Cllr Stuart enquired if there was any outcome to the footpath between the Upper Up and the
    Barracks. The Clerk will ask Amanda Keys at GCC Public Rights of Way for an update.<br>

    was missing and the supporting posts had also been vandalised. The Clerk to report the
