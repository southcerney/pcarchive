 <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Nicholas 
 that the Minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. With the 
 exception of Cllr Caunce and Cllr Mrs Pollard who were absent from the meeting, 
 the remainder of the Parish Council was in favour.</p>
 </font>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Chairman, Cllr Stuart welcomed Youth Parish Councillor Joe 
 Lodge to the meeting. YPC Lodge reported that the recent Fun Run which they had 
 organised on Upper Up playing field was considered a success. Fifty two runners 
 took part and contributed £54 to the Sport Relief 2006 Mile Events fund. The 
 Clerk will bank the money and a cheque will be sent to Sport Relief. The Parish 
 Council sanctioned a request that the YPC be allowed to use Busy Fingers to 
 produce 50 certificates for those who took part. The Parish Council also agreed 
 to a request that it settles the hire charge for a mini bus to transport youths 
 to a function in support of CHYP in Cirencester on receipt of an invoice. YPC 
 Lodge informed the Parish Council that it had planned to have the first Annual 
 General Meeting of the YPC on 21st June 2007. YPC Lodge then left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 17th October I met with Cllr Webb and composed 
 correspondence regarding Parish Council concerns with the enforcement of 
 planning conditions on permitted applications by CDC.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;During the month I delivered the ledger, cheque 
 books and statements to Cllr Smith, Chairman of the Finance Committee for his 
 scrutiny. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday, Saturday and Sunday (20–22 October) I attended 
 the SLCC Annual Conference in Plymouth. Cllr Michael Fletcher Lord Mayor of the 
 City of Plymouth welcomed members. The keynote opening address was given by 
 Richard Sheard Deputy Regional Director, Local Government Practice on the 
 future of local government. Unfortunately he had to improvise his speech, as 
 the White Paper had not been published. I would like to remind all Parish 
 Councillors that there is a seminar on the Future of Local Government, 
 organised by the GAPTC, taking place in the Westwoods Centre, Northleach on 
 Thursday 30th November from 6.45–9.15pm. Those of you considering standing for 
 a further term as a Parish Councillor should seriously consider attending this 
 forum. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I chose to attend workshops on Ethics and Standards and 
 Parish Clustering. Interesting proposed changes to the Code of Conduct were: 
 the requirement for members to report other members to the Standards Board 
 should be deleted; a new “offence” of bullying should be added; the Code should 
 contain an exception for disclosure of confidential information when it was in 
 the public interest and outside official duties; only unlawful conduct should 
 be regarded as likely to bring the member’s office of authority into disrepute; 
 the range of interests which require to be registered should be reduced; the 
 Code should redefine “friend” as “close personal associate”; conversely a 
 personal interest may arise where there is clear personal hostility or 
 resentment between two people or likely to affect “well being”; interests 
 arising from membership of another public body, a charity or local pressure 
 group, should not prevent members from discharging their representative role; a 
 dispensation for members with prejudicial interests to represent their local 
 community, before withdrawing from the decision. Proposed new legislation will 
 include provisions for local filtering of complaints. The Monitoring Officer 
 would investigate and/or mediate prior to a referral to the Standards 
 Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Parish Clustering was still under debate. There was 
 provision under Section 11 of the 1972 Local Government Act for a parish 
 meeting to apply to the district council for an order grouping the parish with 
 a neighbouring parish or parishes. Under sub section 2, parishes shall not be 
 grouped without the consent of the parish meeting of each of the parishes. 
 Prompts and barriers to clustering were exhaustively explained although in my 
 humble opinion I could not find any reasons for South Cerney to join with any 
 of its neighbours. Whenever specific interests affecting a neighbouring Parish 
 have arisen consultation has been adequate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At an advisors’ surgery I was informed how my gratuity 
 would be calculated following changes which took effect on 1st April this year. 
 The calculation is that numbers of years served, times the lower earnings 
 limit, times 3.75% gives the amount of gratuity paid. The lower earnings limit 
 is fixed yearly by the Inland Revenue and this year stands at £4,264. Years 
 prior to 2006 may be paid in full but thereafter only 25% can be claimed and 
 the remainder is converted to an annuity. The final sum will possibly be so 
 irrelevant that it should be possible to persuade the Inland Revenue to 
 consider the gratuity as a “trivial commutation” and have it paid in full. 
 Calculations which I have produced regularly are an accurate assessment of the 
 Parish Council’s liability. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Personal communications and use of the Press was an 
 interesting workshop, especially in view of my recent experience in commenting 
 about difficulties mentioned by our PCSO. Regardless of the event it is always 
 possible to encourage the Press to report our news as well as the story they 
 wish to publicise. In the case of the PCSO it was emphasised how much she was 
 appreciated by the Parish Council and residents alike. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Overall it was an exhausting event but one which I 
 thoroughly enjoyed swapping experiences with like minded associates. I always 
 return from the event feeling uplifted and better briefed on my job. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Youth Parish Councillor Dominic Brown reported that on 
 Sunday 28th October, South Cerney Youth Parish Council (SCYPC) held a Fun Run 
 at Upper Up playing field in the village in aid of Sport Relief. Lots of 
 families attended and it was a great success. They raised £54. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 31st October I took delivery of a radar speed gun from 
 Jan Wildman. After instructions on its operation I delivered it to Cllr Squire. 
 Previously I had asked for volunteers to operate the equipment and the only 
 other Parish Councillor to show interest was Cllr Caunce. Mrs Wildman will 
 return on 14th November to collect the equipment. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After being reminded by Cllr Nicholas that our Freedom of 
 Information Publication Scheme would require reapproval in February 2007 I made 
 enquires with the Information Commissioner’s office as to our next step only to 
 be informed that the scheme was being reviewed and the period had been extended 
 to late 2008. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During October of the 21 available working days and not 
 counting</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PC Freeman</b> <br>
 The Chairman apologised to the meeting for allowing PC Chris Freeman, at the 
 start of the previous meeting, to make a presentation to the Parish Council 
 without being invited. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BetterDrivingPlease.com</b> <br>
 The Clerk replied negatively to an enquiry from Cllr Harris if a reply had been 
 received from Inspector Williams regarding the constabulary’s attitude to the 
 web site BetterDrivingPlease.com </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewerage Pipe Line</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported that there was a very real possibility that the planned 
 sewerage pipe line would be realigned obviating the necessity of major 
 disruption to residents. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow River Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to arrange a meeting between Jennifer Watkins, Senior 
 Highway Representative Gloucestershire Highways, Steve Hanson Payback in the 
 Community Supervisor, Cllr Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart to discuss a 
 recent letter from Ms Watkins suggesting a change of plan for the 
 reinstatement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> Thames Water Utilities Ltd had 
 responded positively to a request from the Parish Council to dig out 
 contaminated mud from the ditch in Station Road. Of the two options the Parish 
 Council was in favour that Thames Water dig out all of the top soil and remove 
 any greenery or grass. The Clerk will inform Thames Water.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Field and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 6th November. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fun Run</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had apologised for his absence at the Fun Run organised by the YPC 
 and held on Sunday 29th October. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had referred to a letter in correspondence from Jennifer Watkins, 
 Gloucestershire Highways Senior Area Highways Representative pointing out that 
 Steve Hanson, from the Payback in the Community Team had informed her that his 
 works teams did not have sufficient technical knowledge to carry out the 
 stabilising work as detailed by James Harris Contracting. In view of this she 
 then stated that the design to reinstate the erosion on the south side of the 
 river bank will need to be more basic as the works team is generally unskilled. 
 She favourably suggested, as an alternative, that gabion baskets are 
 constructed to support the banks and road in the worst affected sections. The 
 Committee was concerned that a plan to re-engineer the scheme had been 
 unilaterally proposed, particularly as the Parish Council had agreed to 
 subsidise the original plan. The Committee had asked the Clerk to arrange a 
 meeting with Ms Watkins, Gloucestershire Highways and Steve Hanson to discuss 
 the situation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Speed Limits</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that all three of the interactive speed signs were now 
 in operation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Report</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had asked that the words “set fire to” in the first line of his 
 inspection report are replaced with “build a small fire in”. He argued that the 
 original statement was too emotive. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Low Level Lighting in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire had reported that Mr Mould, Lower Mill, Bow Wow was not now so 
 enthusiastic about installing lights in the vicinity of the footbridge as 
 groups of youths were creating a regular disturbance in his neighbourhood and 
 he thought more light might exacerbate this problem. Cllr Squire will liaise 
 with the Street Lighting team and seek its advice. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris had ascertained from Mr Timbrell that A.P. Transport was not 
 interested in clearing the ditch due to pressure of other work. Cllr Harris had 
 arranged for Bison Plant Hire to quote for the work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lady Fanshawe’s Hedge, Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had asked the Clerk to enquire from Gloucestershire Highways what 
 action had been taken to cut back the overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fun Run</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had congratulated the Youth Parish Council on its successful 
 promotion of the Fun Run on 29th October at Upper Up playing fields. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Future of Mineral Planning in Gloucestershire</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had read the megillah on Issues and Options on the future of 
 mineral planning but had nothing substantive to report.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that everything on the playing field was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
 Cllr Harris reported that everything on the playing field was in order</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b><br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that the cradle seats on the junior swings had been 
 replaced. New grass seed planted last month had germinated well and there is 
 hardly any earth visible. The cycle mounds are not much in use and are tidy 
 enough for this time of year. The re-seeded areas of the cricket ground seems 
 very good and there is water running out of the drainage pipes during high 
 rainfall periods. The new fence section in the car park had been completed 
 although one rail to the left of the entrance from the main road has been 
 broken off. The Clerk would ask R.O.W. Berry to make the repair</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in
 Berkeley Close</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that Guy Wakefield had enquired how 
 much money the Parish Council would accept to take on ownership of the public 
 open space at Bloor Homes’ development. Mr Wakefield was told that a more 
 realistic amount than the £15,000 offered would be considered. A precise amount 
 was not mentioned. Mr Wakefield would meet with his client although he was 
 doubtful if a better offer could be achieved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Additional Lighting in Broadway Lane</b> <br>
 After liaising with the Street Lighting department of Gloucestershire Highways, 
 Cllr Squire received a letter suggesting that six extra lights would enhance 
 visibility. Estimated total cost of the scheme would be £2,500 plus VAT. It was 
 proposed that if the Parish Council agreed to a 50:50 share of the cost the 
 Street Lighting section would be happy to instruct its contractor to proceed. 
 It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Committee 
 recommended the scheme for approval by the Finance Committee. After a vote four 
 (4) were in favour and one (1) against. The motion was therefore carried.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Councillors’ Reports</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had reported that he had attended a Highways 
 and Traffic Management seminar on 30th October at Shire Hall, Gloucester. He 
 found the exercise sterile and was not overly impressed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had reported that willow branches had fallen 
 on the south west corner of the Upper Up playing fields in the vicinity of the 
 Shire Ditch. The Committee decided to take no action. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had reported that mini motor bikes were 
 becoming a hazard in the village although he was concerned that one parent with 
 a child were using the cycle mounds on Upper Up playing field as a track. It 
 was agreed that a notice appear in the Cerney News reminding parents of users 
 of these bikes that it was illegal to ride them on public footpaths or roads. 
 The Parish Council would not tolerate them on its playing fields. Cllr Caunce 
 pointed out that there was a dedicated track at the bottom of Blunsdon Hill 
 near Swindon which allowed their use and Cllr Jay noted that there was another 
 at RAF Hullavington. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire had attended a meeting on the 24th October in 
 Cirencester Police Station on Safer Cotswolds Working Together which had lasted 
 for 3 hours. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Squire had closed the 
 meeting at 8.22pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith reported on the deliberations of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on the 6th November. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had conveyed an apology from Cllr Jay for his absence on Monday 
 evening as his mother was unwell. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb had informed the Committee that at a meeting of the Cotswold Water 
 Park Joint Committee (CWPJC) which he attended it was agreed that S.106 money 
 be used to clean the Spine Road. The Committee had agreed that this was an 
 improper use of the S.106 allocation which should be used for capital spending 
 and not ongoing expenditure which amounted to double taxation. The Committee 
 recommended that a letter be sent to the Chairman, Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC) and 
 copied to Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) that the Parish Council is concerned that S.106 
 contributions are to be used in this way. The Parish Council was in agreement. 
 Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC) emphasised that the decision to use S.106 money in this 
 way was an option which had been recommended. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in

 Officer (South): Planning Conditions explained </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">12.&nbsp;&nbsp; CDC – Colin Davis (Enforcement Officer) re 
 Eliot Arms Christmas advertisement </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">28.&nbsp;&nbsp; CDC – Colin Davis (Enforcement Officer) re 
 Planning Concerns Lake 11 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The three items above related to a series of letters 
 regarding the application and implementation of Planning Conditions. Cllr 
 Nicholas had noted that perhaps the communications were becoming too 
 adversarial and it should be remembered that the Parish Council and the 
 Enforcement Officer were on the same side. It should be stressed that the 
 Parish Council has a genuine concern over the state of the Spine Road and 
 sorting out this problem in partnership should take precedence. It was noted 
 that GCC had been able to shut down an operation in Somerford Keynes when 
 conditions it had set on mineral extraction had been breached. The Clerk was 
 asked to enquire as to how this was achieved and then suggest it be applied to 
 offending operators in our parish by the Cotswold District Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A vigorous debate ensued. Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) delivered 
 a sizeable document which outlined the restrictions under which the Enforcement 
 Officers carried out their duties. Although dirt on local roads was alluded to, 
 the main crux of the debate was that planning conditions imposed were not being 
 enforced. Cllr Webb stated that certain conditions expressly stated that 
 development should not commence until the developer had abided with the 
 circumstances imposed. This, he insisted, was not the case in some instances. 
 Specifically, Cllr Webb referred to the wheel washing conditions imposed on 
 Lake 11. Cllr Nicholas stated that when conditions were overlooked they 
 undermined the validity of all conditions. Cllr Bennett (CDC) agreed with Cllr 
 Nicholas who stated that he (Cllr Bennett) was firmly sitting on the fence. 
 Cllr Nicholas argued that it was the duty of Cllr Bennett, as a District 
 Councillor representing this Ward, to act as a spokesman on behalf of the views 
 of the residents. Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated that he would, on behalf of the 
 Parish Council, ask the Planning Department in the morning for a Stop Notice to 
 be issued until the condition was enforced and notify the Clerk of the outcome 
 accordingly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DOGS ON LEADS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay proposed a Members’ motion that South Cerney with 
 Cerney Wick Parish Council recognises its duty to keep any public walk or 
 pleasure ground or any land laid out as a garden or used for the purpose of 
 recreation, clear of dog faeces. It recognises that dog fouling of open spaces 
 is against the law, dangerous and anti-social. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Smith both gave lengthy 
 explanations of the new Act of Parliament on Clean Neighbourhoods and 
 Environment Act 2005 which governed Dog Control Orders. This outline 
 information was useful to members of the Parish Council in explaining how these 
 new controls could be implemented and what the consequences of enforcement 
 would be. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce proposed an amendment to the motion, seconded 
 by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council sets up a committee to investigate the 
 actions and implications of any potential dog control orders. After a vote 10 
 members were in favour and one abstained. The motion was therefore carried. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Parish Councillors Caunce, Jay and Smith volunteered to 
 join the committee and report back its findings to the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REFURBISHMENT OF 14 CENTURY CHURCH WINDOW</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire explained, without prejudice, the work needed 
 to restore the 14th century window in All Hallows church which was in urgent 
 need of repair. Restorers had quoted £40,000 and so far £31,000 had been 
 raised. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire then declared a prejudicial interest and left 
 the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb noted that as there was £1,520 in the Parish 
 Council’s Heritage Building and Monument Fund he proposed this amount as a 
 contribution to the fund. Cllr Nicholas seconded the proposal. Cllr Jay 
 proposed an amendment that the Parish Council grant £2,500 but this counter 
 proposal was not seconded. The Parish Council was unanimous in its approval of 
 the first motion which was therefore carried. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire returned to the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ADDITIONAL STREET LIGHTING IN BROADWAY LANE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported he had received three requests from 
 residents that the quality of street lighting in Broadway Lane be improved. 
 Michael Chamberlain from Gloucestershire Highways Street Lighting department 
 had surveyed the street and confidently concluded that lighting levels could be 
 greatly improved if six electricity wooden poles available were to carry a 
 light each. He explained that funding for such schemes are carried out on a 
 50:50 basis between the County Council and the Parish Council and he estimated 
 that the total cost would be £2,500 + VAT. Cllr Caunce was not in favour as 
 currently the guiding principle encouraged everyone to reduce energy 
 consumption and this increase in lighting provision was at odds with this 
 policy. It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish 
 Council instruct the Street Lighting department to proceed with the scheme on 
 the 50:50 basis explained. After a vote 10 parish councillors were in favour 
 and one against. The motion was therefore carried.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire intended to raise money for a new youth 
 building possibly to be erected in the vicinity of the Scout Hut in Berkeley 
 Close. He was confident that with the support of Police and other interested 
 bodies he could persuade the CDC to favour the scheme. A recent survey carried 
 out by the CDC calculated that there were 600 children under 19 years old in 
 South Cerney. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay recommended that a link be made from the Parish 
 Council web site to include the Village Hall. Parish Councillors had no 
 objections. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb reported that he had attended a meeting of the 
 Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee. Besides his concerns over the spending of 
 S.106 money being used to clean the Spine Road, Cllr Webb was uneasy about the 
 consequences of future mineral extraction in the Parish and surrounding areas. 
 Cllr Harris assured him that a forum existed to discuss these anxieties and 
 there was nothing to be worried about. Nevertheless, Cllr Webb still had 
 concerns about the adequacy of the consultations. </p>
