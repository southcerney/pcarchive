    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 11th JUNE 2008</strong>.</p>

    At 7pm Cllr Stuart welcomed Revd David Bowers and Mr Tony Squire, Church 
    Warden to the meeting. David began by stating he had nothing novel to say 
    although then proceeded to set out his priorities. He will begin by 
    integrating South Cerney with Cerney Wick, Siddington and Preston and take 
    an active part as a governor of Ann Edwards and Siddington schools. He will 
    foster links with the communities through Ann Edwards and the Playgroup and 
    leads to families. He is very interested in the activities of the Youth 
    Parish Council and looked forward to working with its members. In South 
    Cerney he will keep in close contact with the elderly, especially the 
    residents of Box Bush. He is still exploring the area and learning, albeit 
    slowly, the various paths, roads and tracks throughout his parish. If 
    invited he will make every effort to attend meetings. Recently he held a 
    service at the Army camp and will meet with the Welfare Officer to develop a 
    closer relationship with occupants of the base. He would also like to make 
    contact with the occupiers of the holiday homes in this part of the Water 
    Park. Cllr Jay agreed with Cllr Stuart who responded that Revd Bowers was a 
    breath of fresh air in the community and looked forward to working with him 
    in the future. Cllr Nicholas welcomed the thought of integrating with the 
    residents of the Water Park and Cllr Jay, referring to the holiday homes, 
    said that the Parish Council was not opposed to people but to the ever 
    increasing development. The Revd Bowers then informed the Parish Councillors 
    that youth had been a priority in the 24 years since he was ordained and 
    prior to that also. He then introduced Tony Squire who outlined eco projects 
    he was keen to launch. A composting scheme would be started for the use of 
    those who tended relatives’ graves in the church yard. A plan was being 
    discussed to collect rain water from the church roof and recycle it to those 
    who tended the church yard and also to the occupiers of the nearby 
    allotments. Currently he has applied for permission from the Glebe to place 
    a large tank for the collection and storage of water on the allotments. Part 
    of the water collected off the north roof will be used to supply the toilets 
    in the church. These schemes would reduce the cost of mains water. 
    Eventually it will be possible to disconnect the metered water tap at the 
    gated entrance to the church. Of course, Tony Squire said that all this 
    would need money and he was fore warning the Parish Council that it should 
    consider subsidising the strategy through the Village Plan. The leaking 
    church roof had been surveyed and an architect estimated that it would cost 
    £182,000 to repair. Further investigations had revealed that the cause was 
    not as expected and the repairs have now been completed for £3,600 which has 
    been an excellent saving. Cllr Jay enquired if Mr Squire had any problems 
    with the grass cutting contractors. Mr Squire replied that all current 
    problems had been resolved and he had no complaints. The Chairman, Cllr 
    Stuart replied positively to a request from Revd Bowers that he would like 
    to attend further meetings and wished to remain at this meeting until the 
    Youth Parish Council made its report. Cllr Stuart thanked both Revd Bowers 
    and Tony Squire for attending the meeting. Mr Squire then left the room at 
    7.28pm.<br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge and Michael Brown attended the meeting as YPC 
 representatives. Joe Lodge, Chairman of the YPC apologised for not attending 
 previous meetings. He explained a plan the YPC were studying of providing its 
 members with stationery and personalised business cards which would help 
 introduce them to others in the community. Currently there were only 6 members 
 and it was imperative that more were recruited and the message spread. It was 
 planned to meet the youth of the village at Ann Edwards school and create a web 
 site to manage further communications. The design of the stationery and cards 
 was estimated at £105 and printing would be extra. He had inspected the 
 progress of the MUGA and was impressed now that the area had been dug out and 
 the size of the area could be easily seen. Plans would have to be made for an 
 opening event, to include a personality, as part of the conditions attached to 
 the Landfill grant which had been achieved. Suggestions included an open day 
 with the Football and Cricket clubs and maybe the use of the mobile skateboard 
 facility could be arranged. A suggestion from Cllr Walker that he would ask 
 Dame Kelly Holmes’ agent if she might agree to be the personality was 
 gratefully accepted. Cllr Jay said that there was no deadline for an official 
 opening as these events usually took place some time after the scheme was in 
 operation. As Chairman of the Finance Committee, Cllr Jay was minded to propose 
 at the next meeting of his committee that £2,000 be transferred to the YPC to 
 help with its proposed plans. The Parish Council was in agreement. Revd David 
 Bowers and Michael Brown then left the meeting although Joe Lodge remained as 
 an observer for the continuance.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>St James’s Place Foundation</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported on an exchange of emails with Julie Nicholls, a 
 representative from St. James’s Place Foundation, regarding funding of youth 
 activity in the parish. It was a useful exercise as it cleared up a slight 
 misunderstanding as to the purpose of the approach from the Parish Council. He 
 and Cllr Jay will arrange a meeting with Ms Nicholls to advance the involvement 
 of both parties in the provision of youth activities in South Cerney. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Canal Sign</b> <br>
 Cllr Messenger (CDC) will liaise with the Cotswold Canals Communications 
 Officer who organises the installation of the signs and enquire when the said 
 signs might be erected.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Rights of Way Issues</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he will meet with Mike Barton (GCC PROW) on Monday 
 16th June to discuss outstanding rights of way issues within the parish. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GRCC and Village Plan</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had attended a meeting on 20th May with GRCC to promote the idea of 
 a Village Plan to other communities. Cllr Stuart commended GRCC which had 
 composed an excellent report on how South Cerney had delivered its plan and the 
 undoubted gains achieved through its implementation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bledisloe Inspection</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had with Martin Harwood one of the 
 Bledisloe Cup inspectors on 10th June. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Glebe Contractors</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart has arranged to meet with a representative of Glebe Contractors on 
 Tuesday 19th June to discuss the disappointment of the Parish Council with the 
 quality of grass cutting and strimming by that firm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 15th May I accompanied Cllr Mrs Tunbridge to 
 the RIAT briefing at Bader House, RAF Fairford. The Air Show will take place on 
 the Saturday 12th and Sunday 13th July. The theme this year will be the 90th 
 anniversary of the RAF. This year 356 aircraft will partake in the gala which 
 is slightly more than last year’s event. The various traffic routes were 
 comprehensively explained with the closest to South Cerney being the “Brown” 
 route which will take traffic from the south and west after leaving M4 junction 
 17 to the B4696 Spine Road and merging with the “Green” route from the M5 to 
 the A417/A419 to the “Green” car park area. One interesting piece of news was 
 that the northern carriageway of the Blundson bypass would be opened to traffic 
 on the weekend of the show.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 21st May I attended the Annual Parish Meeting 
 of the Parish Council in the Village Hall. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 28th May I accompanied Cllrs Harris, 
 Nicholas, Stuart, Mrs Tunbridge and Walker to a meeting at CDC which outlined 
 the action which would follow a community emergency. During the two and a 
 quarter hour session the responsibilities of the authorities were explained 
 firstly from a CDC perspective by Claire Locke the district’s Emergency 
 Planning Manager followed by Maddi Bali from GCC. With regard to flooding as a 
 community emergency there was concern on the lack of action to control land 
 drainage, supply and distribution of sand bags, contacting those vulnerable 
 residents and exercising the overall plan. Ms Locke tried to diffuse the 
 concentration on flooding stating that communities should plan for the bigger 
 picture and not become too focused on specific emergencies. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 2nd June I attended a site meeting with Cllrs 
 Stuart and Caunce, John Hunt (Chairman of SCCC), Richard Maggs (Thames Water), 
 Spencer Coxon (Murphys), Peter Mitchell (Bruton Knowles) and Stuart Milsom 
 (MAI) to discuss the final reinstatement of the Upper Up playing fields and the 
 car park. See correspondence item 21 for clarification. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During May of the 20 available working days I averaged 4 
 hours per day which is approximately 30 minutes more per day than my contract 
 and is verging on the unacceptable as the statistics now indicate that my work 
 load is increasing. Exceptionally this period has covered the Annual Meeting of 
 the Parish Council and coupled with the two other events explains the increase 
 of the time engaged.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 9th JUNE</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr Caunce had opened 
 the meeting at 7.05pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Harris that Cllr Caunce 
 continues as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee. 
 Cllr Caunce accepted the nomination. The Committee voted all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Vice Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs Tunbridge that Cllr 
 Stuart continues as Vice Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
 Committee. Cllr Stuart accepted the nomination. The Committee voted all in 
 favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Walker had sent an apology for his absence as he was on duty and unable to 
 attend. Unfortunately it had not been despatched in time for the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Unconfirmed Minutes <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart asked that in the second line of the first item of Matters 
 Arising after the word “throughout” – “his section of” is inserted. The 
 Committee agreed that the above change is made. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Graffiti</b> <br>
 Mary Mychaleckyj from the Gloucestershire Youth Service had informed Cllr 
 Stuart that the work involved in removing the graffiti from the railway arches 
 was beyond her capabilities. Cllr Stuart will contact Steve Hanson from Pay 
 Back in the Community to see if his gang can be of help. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path from Station Road to Huxley Court</b>
 <br>
 The Committee agreed that a letter is sent to Mr Westell suggesting a practical 
 meeting without demands with the possibility of working in partnership. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment</b> <br>
 The refurbishment of the Upper Up car park in two stages had been agreed (see 
 correspondence item 21) with Murphy contractors and Richard Maggs, Thames Water 
 representative. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bore Hole Lease</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that agreement with the Environment Agency regarding an 
 increase of rent based on the conditions of the original lease had been 
 reached. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MUGA Developments</b> <br>
 Derek Higginson had kindly mowed and collected the cuttings from the area of 
 turf to be removed for the base of the MUGA. The Clerk was asked to thank him. 
 Murphy contractors were in the process of laying it to refurbish the area 
 damaged by their pipe laying. Top soil was currently being removed to leave the 
 area ready for the insertion of the hard core base. Hartell had informed Cllr 
 Stuart that subject to weather conditions they would start work on the MUGA 
 base in the second week of July and adjust their costings to take into account 
 the work already carried out by the removal of the turf and top soil. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to Safety Surface at Upper Up</b> <br>
 As Glebe Contractors refused to accept responsibility for the damage caused to 
 the safety surface at Upper Up the Clerk was asked to contact George Taylor at 
 Fenplay and arrange for its repair. He was also asked to order 10 bags of 
 special sand to spread on the surface.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the over growing hedge at the entrance to the play 
 area was a scratch hazard and needed to be cut back. The pyracanthas bush on 
 the northern boundary was also in need of pruning. As there had been no reply 
 from Mr Fairbrother to previous requests the Clerk had contacted Mrs Pat Smith 
 and asked her to liaise with him.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up<br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reported that the safety surface was awaiting repair. The cycle 
 mounds have been rebuilt by Thames Water contractors Murphy to the instructions 
 and design of the users. It was agreed that the facilities are much better than 
 before and more use has been noted. Murphy is returfing the service track from 
 the car park to its working area which will be completed shortly. Dog mess was 
 a continuing problem and Cllr Nicholas suggested maps denoting areas out of 
 bounds to dogs off leads are strategically positioned to request dog walkers to 
 keep their animals on a lead until they clear the areas of the swings, football 
 and cricket pitches. The quality of the grass cutting contractors was not up to 
 the expected standard. The entire section around the lake was not cut last 
 week; there was no cut at all this season between the large oaks and silver 
 birch clumps or around the furtherest picnic table; the area between the 
 pavement and chain link fence had been poorly cut and the bottom section was 
 not strimmed. Residents had complained of several other areas of grass cutting 
 throughout the village which had been poorly executed. The Clerk will inform 
 the contractors. Cllr Stuart was concerned with the condition of two memorial 
 trees: (a) the hornbeam (next to the Wreford-Brown oak) was “very sick” and (b) 
 the oak against the herras fence is looking weak which had been noted by the 
 “owners” last autumn. Vandals had lifted Mike Oakeshott’s plaque and block. The 
 nuts on both picnic tables need to be retightened as they are unstable. The new 
 hedge needs careful trimming to allow the plants to thrive. There are two large 
 willow limbs which have fallen from the river hedge and are too big for the 
 Payback in the Community team to deal with. Cllr Nicholas volunteered to 
 tighten the nuts on the picnic tables. Cllr Stuart volunteered to replace the 
 plaque and block. The Clerk will ask suitable contractors to quote for (a) a 
 maintenance and replacement programme at the western end of the Upper Up 
 playing fields; (b) the removal of excess growth along the line of the new 
 hedge and leaving the cut material to mulch; (c) cutting up and removal of the 
 fallen willow limbs by Downs Farm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that he had tightened the nuts on 
 the picnic table although one of the nuts was missing it was not a hazard. Cllr 
 Harris had replaced the uplifted plaque.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the Train Units in the Toddlers Play Area are looking 
 tired. The latch on the gate needs to be replaced. The step on the Adventure 
 Unit had been repaired and the work was acceptable. The sign at the northern 
 entrance to the play area was broken and needed to be replaced. Cllr Harris 
 will email the Clerk with the appropriate wording.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TREE SURVEY REPORT </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Tree Wardens to analyse report and make their 
 recommendations to the Parish Council meeting in July.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLAY AREAS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT SAFETY REPORT </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart noted that John Hicks had found some 
 non-existent safety tiles at Upper Up play area. Presumably it was an editing 
 oversight. The abandoned wheel barrow referred to on the humps and bumps was in 
 fact a necessary piece of equipment to keep the jumps operational.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SEWERAGE PIPE REINSTATEMENT WORKS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart, Cllr Caunce and the Clerk had attended a site 
 meeting on 2nd June. See correspondence item 21 for report. All work was 
 proceeding satisfactorily.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Progress of items on the list was analysed and more added.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported a conversation he had with Ms Kate 
 Bishop (CDC) regarding Dog Orders. CDC was currently discussing the 
 implications of the new orders. A consultation document is being prepared a 
 part of which will propose that a blanket order covering all public spaces in 
 the district is introduced. Enforcement is still an issue which has to be 
 resolved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that Gillian Portlock of 
 Gloucestershire Highways had no objection to the installation of a bus shelter 
 on the site of the current stop in Station Road near to the junction with Box 
 Bush and The Lennards. She recommended that the sight line be maintained by 
 aligning the edge of the shelter with the northern side of the open ditch. Cllr 
 Caunce and Cllr Mrs Chubb will prepare an evaluation of cost and design and 
 present it to the Parish Council for its comments. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.37pm</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 9th JUNE</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.40pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Nichols that Cllr Jay 
 continues as Chairman of the Finance Committee. Cllr Jay accepted the 
 nomination. The Committee voted all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Vice Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Stuart that Cllr Webb 
 continues as Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee. Cllr Webb accepted the 
 nomination. The Committee voted all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land had sent an apology for her absence as she was on holiday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay noted that the spread sheet for the period was in order.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ground Maintenance Payments to Glebe Contractors</b>
 <br>
 Cllr Stuart stated that he was not happy with the quality of the grass cutting 
 contractors. The entire section around the lake was not cut last week; there 
 was no cut at all this season between the large oaks and silver birch clumps or 
 around the furtherest picnic table; the area between the pavement and chain 
 link fence had been poorly cut and the bottom section was not strimmed. 
 Residents had complained of several other areas of grass cutting throughout the 
 village which had been poorly executed. The Committee recommends that the 
 Parish Council withhold temporarily one-third (£460) of the account for work in 
 May and the contractors informed of the reasons. The Clerk will arrange a 
 meeting to discuss the concerns with the contractors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Noticeboard</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay was disappointed with the refurbishment of the noticeboard in Clarks 
 Hay. The covering material was not adhering properly to the backing board. The 
 Clerk will inform Betec of this concern.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Signing off completed work</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay was perturbed that there was not procedure in place to pass the 
 quality of completed work prior to payment. The quality of the grass cutting 
 and the erection of the new noticeboard were examples of his concern. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Partial reallocation of deposit funds at Lloyds/TSB</b>
 <br>
 The Committee recommends to the Parish Council that it agrees to invest £50,000 
 in a higher interest 90-day account under similar conditions as the regular 
 deposit account. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Walker that 
 the Parish Council agrees to invest in the higher interest account. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Web Site Storage</b> <br>
 It has been recommended by Raymond Fenton that the Parish Council agrees to pay 
 a fee of £100 per annum which will provide for the extra storage space now 
 required for the operation of the South Cerney Parish Council’s web site. The 
 Finance Committee recommends to the Parish Council that it agrees to this 
 expense. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the Parish Council agrees to this payment for extra web storage space. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Integrated Youth Offer</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay spoke about the £13,500 worth of grants available from CDC for youth 
 activities and estimated that South Cerney should be applying for £2,000 as a 
 pro rata amount consistent with its youth population. One possible item worth 
 considering applying for was the payment of the rent charged by the Ann Edwards 
 school for the provision of its facilities to Gloucestershire Youth. Cllr 
 Walker agreed to investigate the cost of renting out the school hall for youth 
 activities and report back his findings to Cllr Jay who would then formulate a 
 bid for grant funding. All bids for consideration must be in by the end of 
 July. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Jay had closed the 
 meeting at 9.07pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 9th 
 JUNE</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that Cllr 
 Nicholas continues as Chairman of the Planning Committee. Cllr Nicholas 
 accepted the nomination. <br>
 The Committee voted all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Vice Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Stuart that Cllr Webb 
 continues as Vice Chairman of the Planning Committee. Cllr Webb accepted the 
 nomination. <br>
 The Committee voted all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land had sent an apology for her absence as she was on holiday.</p>

 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the Parish Council agrees with the deliberation of the Planning Committee. 
 The remainder of the Parish Council was in full agreement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris, Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart returned to the 
 room.&nbsp; </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 item as the applicant was a friend and remained out of the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>08/01215/FUL</b> <br>

 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr 
 Stuart that the Parish Council supports the deliberations of the Planning 
 Committee. After a vote 7 members voted in favour, 2 were against and 1 
 abstained. The motion was therefore carried. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas returned to the room. </p>

 Applicant: Mr &amp; Mrs M. Gill, Land Adjoining Ham Cottage, Ham Lane, South Cerney
 <br>
 Revised scheme for proposed house and formation of hammerhead at Land Parcel, 
 Ham Lane, South Cerney GL7 5UF <br>
 The Parish Council objects to this application in the strongest possible terms, 
 due to the very considerable loss of privacy that would be caused to the many 
 adjoining properties. Moreover, the access down Ham Lane is not suitable for 
 the heavy construction traffic that would be needed for the ground works 
 required in connection with such a development. The plan accompanying the 
 revised application is incorrect and misleading, since it refers to an 
 ‘Existing Access’ which in fact is not currently in use, nor has it been for a 
 considerable time. <br>
 OBJECTION </p>

 détritus from participating vehicles being left on local highways. <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish 
 Council accepts the deliberations of the Parish Council. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications granted by Cotswold District 
 Council</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>07/02321/FUL</b> <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9.40pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROMOTION OF HEALTHIER ROUTES TO SCHOOL</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay wished to implement item 3 of the Village Plan 
 the object of which was the promotion of healthier routes to school and item 6 
 which was the improvement of road safety in the village, monitoring the 
 condition of roads and pavements. He showed Parish Councillors a copy of the 
 School Travel Plan part of which planned to lobby the Parish Council for 
 support but more importantly suggested implementation of the overall plan by 
 August 2007. Now, nearly one year later there was no tangible signs of 
 progress. He stated that the Parish Council wants to work with the school and 
 not to be lobbied by it. He suggested that there may be institutionalised 
 thinking that the scheme is potentially dangerous. Cllr Nicholas proposed that 
 a parent or a governor should be identified who would be prepared to make 
 something happen. Perhaps an option may be to invite Stephen Richardson, Head 
 Teacher at Ann Edwards to support the plan. It was agreed that Cllr Jay would 
 liaise with Mr Richardson on how the plan might be encouraged. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COMMUNITY EMERGENCY AWARENESS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart was scathing in his remarks about the quality 
 of the presentation of a recent seminar held at CDC to discuss how communities 
 might react to emergencies. Cllr Nicholas criticised the authorities for their 
 lack of action against riparian owners who did not keep their ditches clear of 
 débris. A more cohesive approach was necessary. It would be necessary to 
 resolve the conflict between the Data Protection Act and an “At Risk” register. 
 Cllr Nicholas will draft a letter to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP on behalf of the 
 Parish Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TEMPORARY AMENDMENT TO STANDING ORDERS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart proposed and Cllr Caunce seconded a motion 
 that a temporary amendment to the dates of the January 2009 and February 2009 
 Parish Council committee and council meetings as laid down in Standing Orders 
 are agreed. Committees will meet on Monday 5th January and Monday 2nd February 
 with the full Parish Council meeting on the Wednesdays following, that is 7th 
 January and 4th February. The normal times of the meetings will resume in 
 March. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
