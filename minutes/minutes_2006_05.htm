  The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart welcomed Sinead 
  Barker, GRCC to the meeting. Sinead had been invited to inform the Parish 
  Council of the need for a Housing Survey in order that Parish Councillors 
  would be better informed as to the requirement, if any, of affordable housing 
  for local people. At the outset, Ms Barker made it very clear that she was 
  independent of either local housing associations or CDC. She reported that an 
  unknown local landowner has made available a parcel of land to provide housing 
  for local buyers who can’t afford to purchase at open market prices. She 
  emphasised that the properties would only be available to those with a local 
  connection. Various schemes would be available through which houses could be 
  rented or shared ownership up to a maximum of 80% of value. The Housing Needs 
  Survey would not be used to justify the use of the land; housing needs were 
  paramount and not the size of the site. Cllr Stuart enquired what would happen 
  when the properties were sold on? Ms Barker explained that potential 
  tenants/part owners would be selected from a housing list compiled by local 
  housing associations. Cllr Jay asked how the local plan would impact on any 
  proposal to develop. Ms Barker replied that these sites would be classed as 
  “Exception Sites” and override the local plan. Cllr Nicholas argued for the 
  requirement to have a housing needs survey in order to give credence to 
  planning application decisions. Cllr Jay enquired what response percentage 
  would be considered adequate. Ms Barker replied that 40 percent would be 
  acceptable. Cllr Harris enquired how much the survey would cost the Parish 
  Council. After a short discussion it was agreed that if the Parish Council was 
  to print and distribute the survey, that would suffice as its contribution. 
  The general mood of Parish Councillors was agreeable to the suggestion of a 
  survey and the Chairman Cllr M. Stuart asked Ms Barker to write with a formal 
  request for such which would then be put on the agenda for a decision. Ms 
  Barker agreed and left the meeting at 7.28pm. <br>

 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30pm.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2091: <b>Village Plan</b> – amend text to read: “Cllr 
 Mrs Pollard had been approached by Ian Nelson and Cllr Jay by Dr P. Stephenson 
 who confided that they were unsure of their roles in implementing a commitment 
 to promote “healthier routes to school”. Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr Jay had been 
 able to assuage their fears.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 that the Minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest as the Clerk 
 was a client and left the room. The Clerk was also asked to leave as was the 
 member of the Press who was present.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PERSONNEL COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following the annual review of the Clerk's salary on 
 10/4/06 the Personnel Committee recommends that the Clerk's salary should be in 
 line with the incremental structure set out by the NALC and SLCC (revised 
 December 2005); that is Scale LC2 Range(b) step 32 with effect from 1st April 
 2006. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Webb 
 that the Parish Council ratify the decision of the Personnel Committee. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas, the Clerk and the member of the Press 
 returned to the room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 28th April I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a 
 session “Celebrating Youth Participation” at CDC, Trinity Road. Groups of 
 youths representing local schools and our own Youth Parish Council were in 
 attendance. Although the meeting was light hearted it had serious points to 
 discuss. District Councillors who attended volunteered to a question and answer 
 session with the youths. Cllr Stuart and myself were subjected to a dress 
 attire make over and paraded ourselves to the enjoyment of the students. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During April of the 18 available working days I averaged 4 
 hours 30 minutes per day which exceeds my contract by 1 hour per day. The extra 
 time was due to preparing the accounts for audit.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grilles on the open ditch</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay reported that both grilles had been cleared. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>2nd Homes Council Tax Grant Application</b> <br>
 Parish Councillors were in agreement with the disappointment expressed by Cllr 
 Stuart and Cllr Squire over the recent rejection by CDC to allow a proposal by 
 the Parish Council to go forward for a funding decision by GCC. Cllr Stuart 
 reminded the District Councillors that this had been the second successive year 
 that the Parish Council had missed out on funds notwithstanding that South 
 Cerney had far more second homes within its boundaries than any other parish or 
 town in the district. The application had conformed to the criteria published 
 by the District Council which had then been ignored at the consideration stage. 
 District Councillors Mrs Clark and C. Bennett were asked to convey the 
 sentiments of the Parish Council to their colleagues on the District Council 
 and lobby for fairer treatment in future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Water Park Questions</b> <br>
 A reply from Cllr Parsons (GCC), to questions composed by Cllr Webb on behalf 
 of the Parish Council, was declared inadequate. Cllr Parsons (GCC) reported 
 that the CWPJC did not think that there were any serious health and safety 
 issues. However, as a safety check Cllr Parsons (GCC) volunteered the services 
 of the county H&amp;E officer and this is being taken up. Cllr Webb had asked: 1. 
 How much of the £135,000 grant given to the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd by 
 the four local authorities came from the CDC and GCC? 2. If the CWP Partnership 
 Grant Agreement is not sufficient to cover the increasing cost to manage the 
 five free car parks (they require in excess of £400,000) will they carry out 
 Health and Safety Risk Assessments and if necessary close them down? As Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) would not be attending the Annual Parish Meeting the Committee 
 asked he be requested to give a written report in reply to the above questions 
 and explain (a) who had benefited from the Second Home Council Taxes and how 
 much discretion did GCC have in its distribution? (b) how is value for money 
 defined by the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd? and (c) what service agreement 
 negotiations have taken place recently? Cllr Mrs Clark responded with caution 
 as issues in progress might be compromised if too much information was divulged 
 at this sensitive time. If and when these negotiations were resolved 
 clarification may be forthcoming.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 8th May. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart read a letter from Inspector S. Williams, Gloucestershire 
 Constabulary, explaining the problems which had been resolved regarding the 
 presence of PCSO Ian Yeomans in the parish. Inspector Williams would attend the 
 Annual Parish Meeting and had asked that he be informed of questions in advance 
 in order that he might research relevant replies. It was proposed by Cllr Jay 
 and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Inspector is informed of the following 
 matters: (a) a breakdown of the number and times of the visits to South Cerney 
 and Cerney Wick by the PCSO during January and February 2006 as previously 
 requested, (b) what action will be taken regarding the depositing of muck on 
 the Spine Road and adjoining roads? and (c) to seek a guaranteed commitment to 
 policing in the parish. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Highway Matters</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire met with Martyn Midgley, Area Programme Manager at 
 10.30am on Wednesday 10th May. Outstanding issues including the zebra crossing, 
 interactive speed limits, signing of the reduced limits on Silver Street to 
 Preston Toll Bar, moving the 30mph to its new agreed position and other 
 problems were discussed. Mr Midgley will make a comprehensive report to the 
 Parish Council before its next meeting when he has further assessed the 
 situation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Litter at Old George</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that Eddie Curtis had removed litter from the river bank 
 close to the Old George.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Honey Combed Safety Surface <br>
 </b>As no reply had yet been received from Technix Rubber Ltd Cllr Squire asked 
 the Clerk to provide their contact details and he would communicate with them. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart apologised for the lack of action regarding the removal of the 
 slide. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cricket Club Pavilion <br>
 </b>A reply from the Cricket Club explaining why no decoration had been carried 
 out to the exterior of the pavilion was received unsympathetically by the 
 Committee. The Clerk was asked to inform the club that the Parish Council, as 
 holder of the titular rights, expected them to keep the pavilion in a 
 tenantable condition and urged them to refurbish the outside promptly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lime Trees in Silver Street</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the Lime trees in Silver Street had been pruned.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he helped Cllr Harris collect the pile of debris 
 mentioned in last month’s inspection report and Cllr Harris had taken it to a 
 landfill site. Users of the mounds had removed more sizeable stones from that 
 area. Otherwise the play area was in good order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris reported the area was in good order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick play area</b> <br>
 After a request by Cllr Caunce at the Committee meeting the Clerk had supplied 
 new signs to replace those on site which had become weathered.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as contractor 
 and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had informed the Committee that the Hornbeam 
 trees in Silver Street were dead and needed to be removed. The Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees with its decision to pay James 
 Harris Contracting £40 to remove the dead trees. It was proposed by Cllr Squire 
 and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agrees to pay James Harris £40 
 for the work. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked that Mr P De Jong, Environment Manager, 
 National Grid, National Grid House, Warwick Technology Park, Warwick CV34 6DA 
 Telephone: (0845) 6056677 be asked to reply to a letter sent in February 
 requesting that errant sub-contractors of their company be requested to make 
 good the damage caused to Jim Parker’s tree. Cllr Squire volunteered to contact 
 the National Grid.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked that the Cotswold Water Park Society be 
 reminded of two previous requests to inscribe a message on the bridleway 
 barrier of the old railway line at Robert Franklin Way play area. Cllr Harris 
 insisted that it was a serious safety issue and must be resolved. The Clerk was 
 asked to copy the letter to Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris requested approval to attend a training course 
 on tree warden duties on 24th June in Gloucester. The Committee was all in 
 favour. The Parish Council concurred. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Jay complained about the quality 
 of the grass cutting along the open ditch and verges in Station Road and 
 requested that the ground maintenance contractor be informed that the work was 
 not up standard. Cllr Stuart volunteered to speak to Mr Gibbs. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire asked the Clerk to apply to Jane Evans 
 (Secretary), Gloucestershire Trust Company, Phoenix House, Stoke Road, Elmstone 
 Hardwicke, Cheltenham, Glos. GL51 9SW for a grant application form.</p>

 deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on 8th May.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Parish Council Bank Account</b> <br>
 The Clerk had obtained the relevant forms from the bank for the opening of a 
 subsidiary account for the use of the Youth Parish Council. Councillors, with 
 the exception of Cllr Smith, had signed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Accounts</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that he had forwarded the accounts to Mrs Gardiner for her 
 audit and comments prior to their despatch to Moore Stephens for final 
 inspection and agreement.</p>

 precedent. (The proposal is contrary to Policy 31 of the Cotswold District

 The building is listed as being of special architectural or historic interest

 involves the retention of plastic signage which by virtue of its alien

 The site lies within the South Cerney Conservation Area, wherein the Local
