    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard had made an apology for her absence, Cllr Baines (CDC) had 
    informed Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) that he would not be present and Cllr S. 
    Parsons (GCC) had made an apology as he would be on holiday.<br>
    <br>
    <b>ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN</b><br>
    Cllr P. Jay thanked the Chairman for his efforts during the past year. Cllr 
    Jay then proposed and Cllr R. Webb seconded a proposal that Cllr Stuart 
    remains as Chairman of the Parish Council. Cllr Stuart accepted. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>ELECTION OF VICE CHAIRMAN</b><br>
    Cllr Squire agreed to stand again as Vice Chairman. There were no other 
    nominations for the post. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr 
    Harris that Cllr Squire be re-elected as Vice Chairman. The Parish Council 
    was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MEMBERSHIP OF COMMITTEES</b><br>
    Finance Committee, Personnel Committee, Planning Committee, Playing Fields &amp; 
    Village Maintenance Committee<br>
    All Parish Councillors wished to continue to serve on the Committees to 
    which they had been appointed during the previous year. Cllr Caunce asked to 
    serve on the Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Burial Authority</b><br>
    Rev J. Calvert and G. James had agreed to continue to be members of the 
    Burial Authority. G. Andrews had informed the Chairman that he would also 
    continue to serve. Cllr Squire was assured by Cllr Jay that as Vice Chairman 
    he automatically sat on all Committees including the Burial Authority.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Snow Warden</b><br>
    Cllr Harris agreed to continue to serve as Snow Warden.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Tree Wardens</b><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb agreed to continue serving as Tree Wardens.<br>
    <br>

    representative.<br>
    <br>

    representatives be elected to serve on their respective committees. The 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 13th APRIL 2005</b><br>
    Page 1953: Meeting With Youth Services Representatives – Cllr Caunce 
    requested that it be recorded in the Minutes that the Youth Services 
    Representatives would present proposals in August or September on how the 
    service could benefit the youth of South Cerney. The plan was to investigate 
    current needs, by talking to the target audience along with Janet Lodge. The 
    Youth Services has a number of defined processes and procedures for 
    understanding local youth issues. Once this ‘needs analysis’ has been 
    obtained they would return to the Parish Council in August or September to 
    present the findings to allow it determine a course of action.<br>
    Page 1955 Clerk’s Report – 4th paragraph 3rd line delete: “i.e. the 50 mph 
    to 40 mph and the 40 mph to 30 mph” insert: i.e. the 60 mph to 50 mph and 
    the 50 mph to 40 mph<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Minutes 
    as altered were a true and accurate record. Cllr Harris who did not attend 
    the meeting and Cllr Caunce who had left the meeting early abstained from 
    voting. The remainder of the Parish Council was in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    Cllr Jay was very critical of the reaction of the Youth Service 
    representatives who had made a presentation on their activities to the 
    Parish Council at last month’s meeting. He said that they had no concept of 
    the requirements of the youth of the village. Cllr Harris said that Janet 
    Lodge was much appreciated for her work and commitment although the 
    facilities she had were poor. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and 
    seconded by Cllr Caunce that Mrs Lodge is invited to attend the Annual 
    Parish Meeting and be presented with a bouquet of flowers in appreciation of 
    her work with the youth of the community. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour and the Chairman agreed to use his allowance to fund the purchase.<br>
    Commenting on a remark by Sam Beard, Cllr Jay said that notice should be 
    taken that not every member of the community had access to the internet and 
    suggested that a link be provided, probably in the United Church building. 
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) said that a computer would be provided eventually and 
    it was possible that access, by arrangement, could be given to the internet 
    at a future date.<br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) provided an information sheet which gave a short account 
    of the responses from the Leader of CDC to questions on road sweeping. CDC 
    accepted responsibility for sweeping all roads in the District other than 
    those managed by the Highways Agency. Every town and village in the District 
    is classified into three zones: Zone 1 is swept every day; Zone 2 is swept a 
    minimum of one a month; Zone 3 is swept twice a year. Notably any other main 
    road is swept as and when money permits, but if a complaint is received, the 
    District Council will investigate it. Cllr Jay suggested that the Clerk 
    prepare a standard letter of complaint which should be sent weekly when the 
    Spine Road and its arteries were affected. It was proposed by Cllr Squire 
    and seconded by Cllr Harris that such a letter be composed and sent to the 
    CDC on a weekly basis. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    The Clerk informed Parish Councillors that there had been no developments 
    regarding the installation of the zebra crossing or the interactive speed 
    limit signs. The Clerk was asked to inform Cllr Parsons (GCC) that enquiries 
    would be made about progress at the Annual Parish Meeting.<br>
    Cllr Bennett provided relevant information on the implications of the 
    Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 (Part 8) which will come into force on 1st 
    June 2005. An example cited a formal complaint where there was concern about 
    a neighbouring hedge. The Act will apply only where a complainant’s 
    ‘reasonable enjoyment’ of their property can be demonstrated as being 
    adversely affected by a neighbouring evergreen high hedge. A complaint can 
    only be valid in those cases where all reasonable attempts at negotiation 
    and mediation between parties have failed. Estimated cost projections 
    indicate that a fee of £550 should cover investigating an individual 
    complaint although a reduced fee of £100 should be charged to complainants 
    who are on low incomes/benefits.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had made arrangements for Cllr Nicholas to attend the 
    next round of the Flood Forum.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Monday 18th April along with Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb I attended a 
    seminar at Longford Village Hall just outside Gloucester. The speaker from 
    NALC endeavoured to explain the basis of how NALC and the SLCC had jointly 
    agreed the new terms and conditions for Parish and Town Clerks. It was 
    followed by a workshop where the audience who had been divided into groups 
    of five or six were asked to decide which category sample Clerks should be 
    allocated. With this experience I met with Cllr Webb to discuss how the new 
    terms and conditions might be applied. The Personnel Committee members have 
    been circulated with the information and the Committee should make its 
    recommendation to the Parish Council at its June meeting. On Tuesday 10th 
    May I attended a meeting of the Village Plan sub committee where plans were 
    made for the Open Day to be held on 23rd June. During the month I completed 
    the annual Parish Council’s accounts and will deliver them to the Internal 
    Auditor (Mrs J. Gardiner) in the near future. When Mrs Gardiner completes 
    her audit I will present the completed accounts to the Parish Council. 
    During April I averaged 4 hours 33 minutes each day over the 21 available 
    working days which is nearly 1 hour per day in excess of my contract. The 
    period was unusual insofar that I attended extra meetings and the final 
    accounts had to be prepared.<br>
    In response to a request from Cllr Jay members of the Personnel Committee 
    agreed to meet on Wednesday 25th May at 7.30 pm at Rose Cottage. The Clerk 
    will inform Cllr Mrs Pollard.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on 9th May.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas remarked that no application had been received for permission 
    to build the roadway at the rear of Willow Grove. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) 
    informed the meeting that the Enforcement Officer at CDC had stopped all 
    work on the project.<br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) left the meeting 8.40 pm.<br>

    Amended Plans – Construction of 23 dwellings and associated works on land at 
    63–80 Berkeley Close, South Cerney (R)<br>
    The amended plans do not remove the reasons for the previous objections

    conditional upon clear evidence that the severe problems with flooding and 
    drainage in this area have been identified and resolved.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>

    Erection of a single storey side car-port at 7 The Lennards, South Cerney 
    (R)<br>
    The proposal is of a poor standard of design, and would detract from the 
    nature of the current street scene, because of the flat roofed design in 
    particular.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish 
    Council accepts the deliberations of the Planning Committee. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest in the 
    following application as the applicant was their personal friend and left 
    the room. Cllr Mrs Chapman explained this application to the remaining

    <br>
    <br>
    Appeal decision on CT.8421/A: 3 Broadway Cottages, Broadway Lane, South 
    Cerney<br>
    The Inspector’s reasons for his Decision are: “1. No.3 is one of a pair of 
    Victorian cottages built of Cotswold stone with stone tiled roofs. Although 
    the appellant argues that they lack traditional Cotswold style, they appear 
    to me to share the characteristics of many of the older buildings which I 
    saw in South Cerney and the examples given in the Cotswold Design Code. They 
    lie just to the north of a road junction, so that the southern flank and 
    rear of the proposed extension would be open to public view. The buildings 
    round about are for the most part more modern, the cottages lie outside the 
    South Cerney Conservation Area, and the Council do not seek to argue that 
    the setting of the Conservation Area is affected by the proposal. 2. The 
    existing cottage is very small, simple, and traditionally proportioned. I 
    see no objection in principle to modernising the cottage and providing more 
    living space. No.2, the adjoining cottage to the north, although also quite 
    small, has been sensitively extended and features a modest gable at the 
    rear. Although the front elevation of No.3 would be unaffected by the 
    proposed extension, the appearance of the side and rear of the property 
    would in my opinion be dramatically altered. The present ‘catslide’ roof at 
    the rear of the property would be replaced by an asymmetric pair of gables. 
    I see no objection in principle to a twin-gable design, but in my opinion 
    the gables proposed would be out of character, because of their bulk and 
    proportions, not only with No.3, but with the more modest gable at the rear 
    of No.2. The southern side elevation of No.3 would also be completely 
    transformed by the mass and rearward extent of the new building. The bulk of 
    the extension would in my view completely dominate the existing buildings, 
    and would create a quite different character, at odds with the intentions of 
    Policy 40 and the Cotswold Design Code. For this reason I conclude that the 
    extension would be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing 
    cottage, and to the street scene, and that accordingly the appeal should be 
    dismissed.”<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Barrier on old railway track</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the barrier still had not been repaired. Recently 
    a horse had been seen unattended on the disused railway line and could have 
    been a danger to children in the play area. Cllr Stuart had a meeting 
    planned with T. Pain (Cotswold Water Park Society) and would raise this 
    matter.<br>
    <b>Rural Road Sweeping</b><br>
    The Clerk referred the meeting to a reply received from Dr Amelia Mullins 
    (CDC) who suggested that the Parish Council lobby our District Councillors 
    for action and to try and persuade the pit operators to stop vehicles using 
    their sites from bringing excess debris on to the highway. The Parish 
    Council agreed to a Committee recommendation that the Coroner be asked if 
    mud on the carriageway was a contributory factor in the recent fatal 
    motorcycle accident on the Spine Road. The letter should be copied to CDC 
    Councillors, Cllr Parsons (GCC), GCC Highways, Gloucestershire Constabulary 
    and Ashton Keynes Parish Council.<br>
    <b>Reduction of Interactive Speed Signs Grant</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had informed him that the grant 
    funding from the Home Office was for a host of crime reduction initiatives. 
    It was considered by those dispensing the grant that the Parish Council was 
    fortunate to receive the £2,000 allocated. Ged Cassell had no authority to 
    suggest that 50 per cent or even 100 per cent could be reasonably expected. 
    Cllr Caunce had reminded the Committee that after full research the decision 
    to install the interactive speed signs was the most cost effective proposal 
    debated and not withstanding that the CDC had restricted its grant 
    Gloucestershire Highways had verbally agreed to erect the signs for the 
    donation agreed by the Parish Council.<br>
    <b>Pathway South Cerney/Siddington/Cirencester</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that he had attended the opening of the Gateway Bridge 
    and met up with representatives of the Canal Trust and British Waterways who 
    were very keen to complete paths and waterways in the Parish and adjoining 
    settlements. A further meeting was planned for Thursday 12th May when along 
    with Cllr Nicholas they would discuss with members of the Canal Trust how to 
    progress the path from the Lock House to Siddington.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Humps</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce and Cllr Harris will arrange for the mini digger which would be 
    provided by Ermin Plant Hire to excavate the humps at Upper Up.<br>
    <b>Metal Storage Container</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had liaised with Major Prior, Quartermaster at 29 Regt RLC and 
    organised that the container, which weighed in excess of 5 tons, be moved. 
    Cllr Squire thanked Cllr Harris for his assistance and the Chairman said 
    that the Parish Council was most grateful to Cllr Squire for his endeavours 
    not only in the moving of the container but more importantly supervising the 
    scheme to rebuild the vandalised War Memorial which was now re-erected.<br>
    <b>War Memorial</b><br>
    Cllr Squire informed the meeting that he hoped the Archdeacon of Cheltenham 
    would preside at a service at midday on Sunday 12 June although the 
    arrangement had yet to be confirmed. Residents would be encouraged to put 
    flowers on the War Memorial prior to the commencement of the service. 
    Donations for the repair had exceeded the required amount and approximately 
    £1,500 would be added to the Parish Council’s Monument Fund.<br>
    <b>Steps from Bow Wow to old railway line</b><br>
    Mr Mould had made repairs to the steps but suggested to the Parish Council 
    that a complete refurbishment would eventually be necessary. Cllr Harris 
    informed the Committee that the steps were only a ‘Permissive Route’ and 
    those using it did so at their own risk. There was doubt as to who owned the 
    steps and Cllr Stuart agreed to raise the matter with Mr Tim Pain of the 
    Cotswold Water Park Society when he meets him on Thursday.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order although seedlings were taking root in the gaps of the safety tiles 
    some of which were wide enough to entrap an adult’s finger. Users of the 
    play area were forcing an access through the rear hedge from Church Lane 
    which should be blocked off in the interests of safety.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in working order. The Clerk was 
    asked to inform the contractor that the grass within the fenced area had not 
    been cut. Gravel had been spread in the gateway leading to Robert Franklin 
    Way. Pyracantha stumps were starting to sprout and needed to be sprayed with 
    a suitable spray treatment. The Clerk would contact licensed contractors to 
    quote for the work which was in an area approximately 14 metres east from 
    the Lakeside sign.<br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the seats of the junior swings were deteriorating 
    and would need to be replaced although this was not a priority. He 
    congratulated James Harris for the tree planting and considered them a great 
    improvement to the area. The Parish Council agreed to replace any tree which 
    died of natural causes within the first year. The surface of the car park 
    had been refurbished. Cllr Stuart reported that an excessive number of empty 
    bottles and cans were being left at the southern end of the new pond each 
    weekend and he suspected that youths were engaged in under-age drinking. The 
    Clerk was asked to report this activity to the PCSO. <br>
    <br>
    <b>SAFETY TILES</b><br>
    Estimates for replacing the safety tiles at the three play areas had been 
    discussed at the Parish Council meeting in January 2005. The Clerk was to 
    contact previous customers from a list supplied, to ascertain if they were 
    satisfied with the installation.<br>
