 Prior to the meeting the Vice Chairman Cllr Squire had welcomed Mr Sean Hodgson and Mr
John Harris of Waters Edge, Lake 10. He then asked Cllr Caunce as lead Parish Councillor
to progress the debate. Cllr Caunce explained some of the priorities that the Parish Council
had with commercial activities involving the development of the redundant gravel pits.
There was major concern over dirty roads caused by either gravel extraction or development
and potential hazardous use of the highway and its junctions. Cllr Caunce explained that the
purpose of the meeting was for the Parish Council to become more proactive rather than
adversarial in dealing with problems that might arise. Sean Hodgson informed the meeting
that the original design of the holiday homes on Waters Edge was for 40 timber designed
buildings but the new plan now being implemented was far more contemporary. The
restaurant, for example, had been cancelled because it was judged to make occupants too
insular. It would encourage lodge users to visit nearby facilities which could only benefit the
local economy. Cllr Jay pointed out that local residents were becoming “claustrophobic”
because of the lack of access to recent developments. Mr Hodgson pointed out that the
public footpath, although currently cordoned off because of health and safety issues, would
be available and there was an extension of the cycleway through the development from
Cerney Wick Lane to the Spine Road. Cllr Caunce pointed out that the junction of Cerney
Wick Lane, Station Road and the Spine Road would become very dangerous when Lake 10
and Lake 11 come into full operation. Part of the traffic assessment of the Lake 11
application mentioned the installation of traffic lights but it was not certain that this would
be agreed. Cllr Nicholas highlighted another concern which was the growth of large
advertisements that blighted the rural scene. Both Mr Hodgson and Mr Harris had noticed
the accumulation of such advertisements. Both acknowledged a suggestion from Cllr Squire
that a sign on the exit of the Waters Edge development should encourage vehicles to use the
Spine Road junction thereby avoiding Cerney Wick. Cllr Squire thanked both gentlemen for
attending the meeting and making their acquaintance. Mr Hodgson and Mr Harris then left
the meeting.

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 
 10th JANUARY 2007</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the Minutes were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas explained that although the members of the 
 Youth Parish Council were enthusiastic other commitments took precedence. The 
 YPC was endeavouring to coordinate its activities and with forthcoming 
 instruction planned, attendance at the Parish Council meeting would no doubt 
 improve.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Layby Rubbish <br>
 </b>Cllr Nicholas reported that the rubbish which had been accumulating in the 
 ditch at the edge of the layby on the Cirencester road in the vicinity of the 
 Lock House had been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Manhole Cover</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the manhole cover outside the property known as 
 “Content” in Station Road had still not been repaired. The Clerk will inform 
 Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Estate Agents Signs</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas noted that the estate agents signs at the Cerney Wick Lane and 
 Spine Road junction had been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>‘No Parking’ Signs at Bridge House</b> <br>
 No further communication had been received from Mr Genillard regarding private 
 parking notices he had attached to bollards outside his house in Silver Street. 
 As the tarmac area was thought to be the responsibility of Gloucestershire 
 Highways the Clerk was asked to enquire if it was in order for such signs. Cllr 
 Mrs Chubb asked the Clerk to enquire, that as the property was in a 
 Conservation Area, was any regulation being breached? </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Surface Water Overflow Pipe</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris was still concerned that in periods of heavy rainfall the blue pipe 
 installed to take water off the highway into Lake 16 was not functioning 
 properly. Cllr Squire reiterated that when he had inspected the pipe it was in 
 good working order. Nevertheless, Cllr Squire would again inform Gillian 
 Portlock about his concerns. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Hedge in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that there was further work needed to reduce the 
 overgrowing hedge. Cllr Squire would bring it to the attention of a more senior 
 representative of Gloucestershire Highways.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 12th January I attended a meeting of the 
 Gloucestershire branch of the SLCC at Minchinhampton. This is a very useful 
 forum to meet other local Clerks and discuss items of mutual concern in an 
 informal setting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I had been invited by Deer Park School to give a talk to 
 Year 10 students on the 8th February regarding my role in the community as 
 Parish Clerk. Due to the heavy snow fall the talk was cancelled. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During January of the 22 available working days I averaged 
 31/4 hours per day which is slightly less than my contract allows.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE 
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Field and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 12th February. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had made an apology for his absence as he would be on holiday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Speed Limit Signs exiting Duke of Gloucester Barracks

 Advertising “A” Boards</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire had spoken with Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire Highways Area 
 Representative on these outstanding issues and had been assured that the jobs 
 were on her schedule. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Blocked Grille on Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris and Cllr Squire volunteered to unblock the grille.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that the pyracanthus hedge, on the northern side of 
 the play area in Cerney Wick, needed to be pruned. The Clerk will inform Mrs 
 Pat Smith, Chairman of the Cerney Wick Village Committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that bolt replacements on the Train Units were still 
 required. Soil was needed in the area of the Senior Swings and Goal Posts. The 
 Pay Back in the Community Team was due to do the work on Friday 16th February. 
 The bushes on the boundary needed trimming.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Due to the absence of Cllr Stuart, Cllr Mrs Chubb made an inspection of Upper 
 Up play area and reported that all was well except that there was some litter 
 dumped over by the top of the football pitch and there was more rubbish and the 
 remains of a fire by the pond hedge.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After careful scrutiny the Committee unanimously 
 recommended that the Parish Council accepted the quotation from Rodney Gardiner 
 for work in Cerney Wick. In the opinion of the Committee there were two 
 quotations for the remaining work which were competitive. It was decided that 
 both contractors are requested to submit a best and final offer before a 
 decision was taken on the award.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FOOTBRIDGE DONATION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Gloucestershire County Council PROW had written to Cllr 
 Stuart stating that if the Parish Council was prepared to help with the cost of 
 the footbridge, then Mr M. Barton could, in his words “start to push the budget 
 holder!”. Accordingly, after some debate, it was proposed by Cllr Caunce and 
 seconded by Cllr Harris that the Committee was minded to recommend that a 
 donation of £1,000 was made to the PROW department. Three members voted in 
 favour and 1 against. The motion was therefore carried.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TRAFFIC CONTROL MEASURES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommended that the Parish Council 
 considers to actively campaign for the installation of interactive traffic 
 control lights at the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Station Road and B4696 
 (eastern Spine Road). Alteration to the layout of the junction on the Preston 
 Toll Bar crossing was discounted as the Committee considered that if users 
 follow the signs properly the operation of the junction was adequate. 
 Furthermore, the junction was out of the domain of the Parish Council. Cllr 
 Nicholas objected and asked that the item is put on next month’s Parish Council 
 meeting agenda.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TREE REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris precised the report which had recently been 
 carried out by Cllr Webb and himself. He emphasised that with his experience 
 the main issue to be considered was the potential danger of the 15 poplar trees 
 on the south bank of the Bow Wow. Accordingly the Clerk had informed the 
 Gloucestershire Highways, by letter, of the report’s observations. Cllr Harris 
 requested that Sophia Price, Heritage and Design Manager at CDC was also 
 notified. The Clerk concurred. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Another tree in need of inspection is the Sycamore near 
 the residence known as Rivercroft at the end of Robert Franklin Way Close. Cllr 
 Harris described it as being stag headed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired if the damage to Jim Parker’s tree 
 had been resolved. Cllr Squire and the Clerk had both been unsuccessful in 
 efforts to conclude this business. The Clerk was asked to make a further 
 attempt to see if a result could be achieved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay asked that Sophia Price CDC be asked to inspect 
 the Cedar outside the George public house. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was considered that the hedge round the Upper Up 
 playing field was in need of urgent attention, before the 2007 nesting season 
 begins. Due to lack of previous maintenance it now needs, besides a 
 tractor-mounted flail to trim, a chainsaw to cut out the larger trunks. It was 
 not considered practical to paint-mark the larger elements for removal but to 
 coordinate the heavier extraction during flailing. Cllr Harris proposed that a 
 project manager was appointed to work in conjunction with the tractor flail.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the debate, 
 after inviting the Parish Council to consider him as Project Manager and left 
 the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
 that James Harris Contracting be appointed as Project Manager to oversee the 
 flailing of the hedge and perform work with his chainsaw where necessary. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to issue a tender document to 
 contractors based on the tabulated findings within the report and ask for 
 submissions to be returned before the next meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris thanked Cllr Webb for his input and help in 
 carrying out the inspection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>HOUSING NEEDS SURVEY</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Shortly before leaving for the Committee meetings Laura 
 Mills, GRCC had informed the Clerk that due to illness she would be unable 
 attend this evening. Consequently it was agreed that Ms Mills would make her 
 report on the outcome of the Housing Needs Survey prior to the Parish Council 
 meeting in March. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform Siddington Parish 
 Council that he considered the over growing hedge in the vicinity of Dairy

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a pipe near the two bridges over

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ground Maintenance Contract</b> <br>
 The Committee analysed the quotations received from contractors to carry out 
 ground maintenance work in the Parish on a frequency basis, i.e. number of 
 cuts. As Glebe Contractors proved to be the most competitive the Committee 
 recommended that the Parish Council accepted its quotation and award it the 
 contract for two years.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard that the Parish Council appointed Glebe Contractors Ltd to carry out 
 its ground maintenance contract for the 2007 and 2008 growing period. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Footbridge Donation</b> <br>
 Gloucestershire County Council PROW had written to Cllr Stuart stating that if 
 the Parish Council was prepared to help with the cost of the footbridge, then 
 Mr M. Barton could, in his words “start to push the budget holder!”. After some 
 debate, it was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the 
 Committee was minded to recommend that a donation of £2,000 was made to the 
 PROW department. The Committee was in agreement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Nicholas 
 that the Parish Council makes a donation of £2,000 to the Gloucestershire 
 County Council PROW to subsidise the cost of the erection of the footbridge on 
 the South Cerney to Siddington path at Cowmeadow Ground. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Senior Citizens Activity Grant</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire had suggested at the meeting last month that it would be beneficial 
 if the Parish Council was to award a grant, under the Village Plan, to senior 
 citizens’ activity sessions. The Committee was in favour that the Parish 
 Council give a grant of £300 to subsidise fees levied on participants which 
 could be managed by the South Cerney United Church. The Clerk was asked to 
 suggest that fees could be subsidised by 50p per person per session. If this 
 proved to be successful in encouraging attendance consideration would be given 
 to its extension. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the Parish Council gives a grant to the South Cerney United Church 
 from its Village Plan reserve budget of £300 to subsidise participation by 
 senior citizens in activity sessions. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Retirement Donation</b> <br>
 Notification that GAPTC County Secretary Richard Belliss was about to retire 
 and an appeal for a contribution for a gift had been received. After a short 
 discussion the Committee agreed that it was not in a position to provide a 
 donation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Computer Program Upgrade</b> <br>
 The Clerk had requested that the Committee consider purchasing an operating 
 system update to his laptop. This was refused and the Clerk was advised to wait 
 until the system had proved its stability.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Housing Needs Survey</b> <br>
 Shortly before leaving for the Committee meetings Laura Mills, GRCC had 
 informed the Clerk that due to illness she would be unable attend this evening. 
 Consequently it was agreed that Ms Mills would make her report on the outcome 
 of the Housing Needs Survey prior to the Parish Council meeting in March.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on the discussions of the Planning 
 Committee which had met on 12th February. Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr 
 Mrs Pollard, Cllr Squire and Cllr Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas 
 opened the meeting at 9:18pm. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/V Permission Granted</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to write to Mr Sean Herbert in appreciation of 
 his candid and prompt admission that it was his decision alone which gave 
 permission for this application. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.4073/F <br>
 Advertising at Lake 15</b> <br>
 The Clerk was to request that Colin Davies, CDC Enforcement Officer inspect the 
 entrance to this site which, contrary to permission granted, is advertising its 
 canteen/restaurant facilities. <br>
 Condition 1 reads: In accordance with the applicant's letter dated 27th 
 January, 2004 there shall be no off-site advertising of the clubhouse 
 facilities other than for the purposes of angling, and the said facilities 
 shall not be made available to visiting members of the public other than when 
 the site is in operation for angling purposes.<br>
 Reason: To ensure that the clubhouse facilities remain ancillary to the angling 
 use of the application site, in the interests of sustainability and in 
 accordance with PPG13, Gloucestershire Structure Plan Second Review Policies T1 
 and NHE8, and Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 2 and Water Park Policy 8.1
 <br>
 Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that Michael Grace, CDC Enforcement Officer had 
 visited the site and reminded the occupants of the conditions imposed. The 
 advertisement had been moved to within the boundary of the development. </p>

 Retention of residential gypsy caravan site comprising 11 pitches, access road,

 The Committee considered that residential development on this site would be 
 quite unsustainable. The residents will be entirely dependant on private motor 
 vehicles for access to any and all amenities. The new entrance will be too 
 close to the existing entrance. There should only be one entrance for both 
 sites. As the plots will not be connected to the main sewerage system the 
 proposal is not sustainable development. <br>

     concerned at the ambiguity surrounding the entrances/exits to the site. 
     From the documents supplied to the Parish Council it is not at all clear if

     Cerney Wick Lane, B4696 Spine Road and Station Road – considered a

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb complained about the state of Broadway Lane. 
 Cllr Squire explained that no further action could be expected until the 
 sewerage work was completed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to notify CDC that the drains on 
 the highway from the entrance to the Fishing Club east to the Spine Road needed 
 to be cleared as the road was flooding after rainfall. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the water hydrant sign 
 opposite Oakbeams and outside Boxbush Farm was in the ditch.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris requested that Gloucestershire Highways be 
 asked to renew the double yellow lines on Spine Road in the vicinity of the 
 cable ski operation on Lake 11 and the single yellow lines on Cerney Wick Lane 
 as they were almost obliterated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform the Environment 
 Agency that polystyrene sheets were floating in the river Churn down stream 
 from the Spine Road towards Churn Pool near Cerney Wick. Also could the Clerk 
 inform GCC PROW that the footpath from the Spine Road to Churn Pool needed to 
 be cleared to improve access. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had unearthed, in a cupboard in the main hall, 
 old Parish Council minutes dating back to 1894. It was agreed to transfer these
