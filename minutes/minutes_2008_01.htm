    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 9th JANUARY 2008</strong>.</p>

    <p align="left">Prior to the Parish Council meeting the Chairman, Cllr Stuart warmly welcomed Dr Simon
Pickering from the Water Park Society Ltd to a meeting with Parish Councillors. Cllr Stuart
reminded Parish Councillors of the implications of the Biodiversity Act in how every deed
sanctioned by the Parish Council must work in conjunction with its aims. Dr Pickering spoke of
how the first biodiversity action plan had been launched in 1997 and now a new plan was to
take over for the period 2007 until 2016. Notable successes of the old plan was the progress of
water voles and otters in the area. The Act, he continued, made it a duty for Parish Councils to
take account of biodiversity in every sphere of influence and operation to improve the
environment of the Parish. Grants were available and there were numerous schemes locally
being planned to access the remaining S.106 contribution from the 4 Pillars Hotel development.
Cllr Stuart, Cllr Jay and Cllr Harris would meet with Dr Pickering on 15th January to discuss
and inspect biodiversity opportunities which might be eligible for funding. Cllr Caunce
suggested installing bird and bat boxes in a scheme which might include input from the youth of
the parish to install and manage. Dr Pickering mentioned another available fund from the BBC
Breathing Spaces which would grant sums of up to £5,000 but the deadline for applications was
18th January. He suggested other schemes the Parish Council might help with, for example the
management of hedgerows and the encouragement of bats. All these ideas will be further
discussed when the group meets on 15th January. In reply to a question from Cllr Harris, Dr
Pickering confirmed that the Scott-Wilson report was moving forward and a public meeting was
planned for 31st January to present the master plan to local parishes. Work had started on
Lakeside car park and would continue. If the Parish Council wished to promote access from the
bridlepath on Lake 16 to the car park it should form a group to lobby GCC Highways to support
such a scheme. Dr Pickering would use his persuasive powers to assist. Cllr Stuart, on behalf of
the assembled Parish Councillors, sincerely thanked Dr Pickering for his attendance. Dr
Pickering then left the meeting.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">No representative from the Youth Parish Council attended

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Missing VAS</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to enquire from Gloucestershire Highways when the damaged 
 VAS in Silver Street might be reinstalled. Cllr Harris reported that the VAS in 
 Broadway Lane was now back in operation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that he had been informed by BETEC Joinery Ltd that work 
 on the replacement notice board in Clarks Hay should not be expected before the 
 end of February. </p>

 Cllr Stuart reported that he had spoken with Mr Westell of Aggregate Industries 
 on the problems of designing a suitable barrier to access the permissive path 
 and discussions would continue. Cllr Stuart was confident that a successful 
 outcome will be possible. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bore Hole Lease</b> <br>
 The initial agreement with the Environment Agency granted on 19th December 2002 
 for a term of 25 years at an initial rent of £100 provides for an upward review 
 of the rent every 5 years. Cllr Nicholas kindly calculated the increase which 
 should be demanded for the use of part of the Upper Up playing field as a site 
 for an observation borehole based on the all items index figure of the index of 
 retail prices as published by the Office for National Statistics as £117.68. 
 The Parish Council agreed that the Clerk propose this figure to the Environment 
 Agency.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">On the evening of 2nd January I attended a meeting of the 
 Finance Committee held at Cllr Jay’s house to discuss the Precept demand. Cllr 
 Mrs Land was unable to attend as she was recovering from illness. Cllr Caunce 
 attended as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee. 
 The recommendations are an agenda item for debate later. On behalf of the 
 members attending I would like to thank Cllr Jay for his generous hospitality. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During December of the 16 available working days I 
 averaged 41/2 hours per day which is acceptably more than my contract allows

 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th JANUARY
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr Caunce had opened 
 the meeting at 7:03pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Walker was absent due his continuing illness.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that no reply had been received from Gloucestershire 
 Highways regarding the exposed pipes which transverse the ditch in front of 
 culverts causing debris to collect and cause obstruction to the water flow 
 although in fairness, due to the recent holiday festivities, the report had 
 been made on Sunday 30th December. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Silt in Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that silt and gravel had been deposited in the ditch near 
 to The Piece after the most recent burst sewerage main in December 2007. The 
 Clerk was asked to inform Gloucestershire Highways of the need to dredge the 
 ditch bed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CCTV Survey</b> <br>
 On 29th November 2007 the Clerk had written to Chris Franklin, Stakeholder 
 Manager (South) at Gloucestershire Highways for an update on actions 
 recommended by a cctv survey carried out in November 2001. A reply was awaited. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways was still awaiting a consent license 
 from the Environment Agency before work could proceed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter Designs</b> <br>
 The Committee Chairman, Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr Mrs Chubb for researching 
 estimates of bus shelters prior to the precept meeting. A reply was awaited 
 from Gloucestershire Highways to an enquiry where it would consider the most 
 appropriate location for a bus shelter in the vicinity of the junction of The 
 Lennards and Station Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VAS Reliability</b> <br>
 The Clerk had ascertained that Gloucestershire Highways would be responsible 
 for the maintenance of the signs when the guarantee period expired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path to rear of Kingfisher Place</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart will contact Mr Westell at Aggregate Industries to progress 
 negotiations on various access proposals. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dog Bin Installation Quote</b> <br>
 R.O.W. Berry’s quote was discussed but after discussion it was unresolved as to 
 which type of bin or the fixture thereof should be selected. It was agreed that 
 firm proposals be discussed at the next Committee meeting in February. Road 
 Markings outside Village Hall It had been ascertained from Gloucestershire 
 Highways that the markings had been made after a request from a village 
 resident. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Loss of View from Millennium Seat, Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas determined that Mr Stansfield, owner of The Downings, has a 
 registered ‘possessory’ title to the strip of river bank, opposite the 
 Millennium Seat in Bow Wow, adjoining his property. Cllr Nicholas will liaise 
 with Mr Coope, who is a neighbour of Mr Stansfield, to see if it is possible to 
 persuade Mr Stansfield to agree to lower the height of the leylandii trees 
 which curtail the view of the church from the public seat.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that all was in order at the Cerney Wick play area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that all was in order at the Robert Franklin Way play 
 area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the play area was in good order. The Cycle Mounds had 
 little use at this time of year. The drainage system was working well. The 
 surface of the car park is much worse than last month probably due to the extra 
 use by vehicles delivering cardboard and plastic bottles to the recycling bins.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>LOCAL FLOOD PLAN</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that Mr Sokol from the Environment 
 Agency had written to Mr Franklin at Worms Farm stating that clearance of 
 ditches on his farm would alleviate a potential cause of flooding. Mr Sokol 
 made it clear to Cllr Harris that he did not have any powers to insist that 
 action be taken. Cllr Nicholas agreed to liaise with the Franklins regarding 
 the state of their ditches. A CD report comprising some 148 pages on the summer 
 flooding emergency was in circulation and the Committee agreed with Cllr Caunce 
 who suggested that Councillors study this report which could then be discussed 
 at the March Committee meeting. Cllr Nicholas had circulated an abridged 
 version, some 14 pages, of the report highlighting relevant extracts applicable 
 to the parish. Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Nicholas for his efforts. Cllr Nicholas 
 stated that it was unrealistic that the Parish Council should be considered as 
 a first responder. A more practical solution would be for the contact details, 
 of those in authority accountable in such emergencies, to be displayed on the 
 notice board, published in the Cerney News and on the web site. The Clerk was 
 asked to thank Rachel Topps (GCC) for arranging delivery of 50 the booklets for 
 distribution. Cllr Stuart disagreed with the statement printed on the inside 
 front cover of the “Flood Guide” that the publication had been sent to every 
 resident in Gloucestershire. The Parish Council agreed with a suggestion from 
 Cllr Stuart that the Clerk inform Ms Topps that South Cerney had not been 
 included in the distribution and this needed to be rectified. The Cerney News 
 maybe could provide a distribution service if contacted. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BOLLARDS AND LIGHTS IN BERKELEY CLOSE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to enlist the help of Cllr Parsons (GCC) in 
 trying to resolve the problem of the non-operating street lights in the 
 Winchcombe Gardens neighbourhood and also the dangerous stealth bollards in the 
 highway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DOG CONTROL ORDERS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee considered that the CDC survey had been 
 emailed without adequate explanation. Parish Councillors recognised that dog 
 fouling is a problem and the Committee was proactive in increasing the number 
 of dog bins in the Parish. It was questioned as to how the proposed regulations 
 might be enforced. The Committee was happy to respond but would like 
 clarification of the detail, background and context of the new regulations. The 
 general answer to all the survey’s questions was “possibly”. The Clerk was 
 asked to invite Kate Bishop to a meeting with Parish Councillors to explain the 
 implications.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that encapsulated A4 instruction 
 sheets relating to an Army training exercise on 12th December were still in 
 situ at various locations throughout the village. The Clerk was asked to 
 request the Adjutant to arrange for their removal. Cllr Harris reported that 
 large pipes buried vertically in the ground in the vicinity of Lake 16 and 
 Kingfisher Place had been left, in his opinion, with inadequate protection. 
 Prior to the Parish Council meeting Cllr Stuart had ascertained that the work 
 was not yet completed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked that fly tipping in the vicinity of 
 Andy’s Lake, off Wildmoorway Lane, be reported to Roger Sollis at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that a biodiversity meeting at the 
 Cotswold Water Park Society on 18th December had been rearranged for 15th 
 January. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce closed the 
 meeting at 8:25pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th 
 JANUARY</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8:30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising <br>
 </b>The Clerk reported that he had met with Chris Graham, MAI who had advised 
 on the most prudent and cost effective way in which to recover outstanding fees 
 from Thames Water. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay was satisfied with the current financial position as stated in the 
 spread sheet. He reiterated that it was a valuable tool enabling a close 
 control of Parish Council expenditure. It also highlighted instances of 
 underspend which had been addressed at the Precept meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Precept</b> <br>
 The Finance Committee ably assisted by Cllr Caunce had met on 2nd January to 
 discuss the Precept demand for the next financial year. Cllr Jay explained 
 briefly the basis of the demand and with the support of the Committee commended 
 its recommendations to the Parish Council. Cllr Jay noted that in comparison 
 with Northleach which had a band ‘D’ of £100 to achieve a precept of £80,000, a 
 band ‘D’ property in South Cerney would attract a contribution of £46 for a 
 precept of £65,000. Overall a band ‘D’ property now would contribute £1.81 less 
 than the previous year. Cllr Jay perceptively added that the budget was like a 
 tardis with more on the inside than might be assumed from its content. It was 
 proposed to accept the deliberations of the enhanced Finance Committees’ budget 
 recommendations by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb. The Parish Council 
 agreed unanimously. Cllr Stuart wished to thank Cllr Jay on behalf of those 
 attending the budget meeting for his generous hospitality. Calor Gas Prize Fund 
 Cllr Nicholas stated that he had identified a suitably meritorious scheme to 
 which award this fund. If the Parish Council agreed the money would be well 
 utilised in funding the services of the youth workers in the parish especially 
 if the offer was match funded. Preferably advantage should be taken in this 
 financial year. He asked for Parish Council support that the fund be 
 specifically earmarked for this cause. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and 
 seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council is minded to accept this plan for 
 the Calor Gas fund. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Clerk was 
 asked to write to the youth workers to inform them of the Parish Council’s 
 decision.</p>

 for clarification from CDC. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications Received by Cotswold District 
 Council</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the 
 following two applications as the applicant was a business colleague. Cllr 
 Harris left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.0006/4/V <br>
 </b>Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Construction of two (2) storage buildings each containing seven (7) lock-up 
 cupboards at Lake 16, Broadway Lane, South Cerney <br>
 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/4/A &amp; Further Amendments: (1) Lodge Type C (2) 
 Contextual lakeside extension<br>
 </b>Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Amendment to previously approved scheme of holiday lodges, Plots 16-24 only at 
 Lake 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney <br>
 The Planning Committee recommends that the Parish Council objects to this 
 application because, although this application is stated only to relate to 
 plots 16-24, the ‘overall layout’ drawing no 7714/201 shows a new vehicular 
 entrance on to Cerney Wick Lane. The proposed re-positioning of plots 16-24 
 will inevitably result in the development spreading right round to the southern 
 edge of Lake 11, with lodges positioned in the southern corner. That could add 
 support to an application for a new entrance on to Cerney Wick Lane. Further, 
 this application introduces a new entrance with gate house and barriers on to 
 Cerney Wick Lane which could be the main entrance to the lodges. This will 
 increase the traffic problems at the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Spine Road 
 (B4696) and Station Road. There will, as a matter of course, be more traffic 
 accessing the Spine Road from the leisure complex through that junction. <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2443/P Winchcombe Gardens</b> <br>
 There was doubt about the implications of the wording of the Condition applied 
 to the planning permission CT.2443/P by CDC. It was unclear if there was a 
 requirement to provide play equipment for the public open space. The Committee 
 stated that it was not up to CDC to recommend that the Parish Council accepts 
 the offer from Bloor Homes. Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb would together compose 
 a letter asking for clarification from CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.4498/W Four Pillars Hotel</b> <br>
 The Clerk was to copy the text of paragraph (b) to Gloucestershire Highways and

 provide funds to assist with the purchase of new equipment. We will offer 
 interest free loans to assist with the purchase of new equipment, if required. 
 The Clerk was to enquire into the conditions of such a loan and also if the CDC 
 might recommend a suitable projector or if a discount might be arranged by it 
 for a bulk purchase of such equipment. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Councillors’ Reports</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to inform the Enforcement Officer 
 (CDC) that there are two Caribbean type structures outside the Old George 
 public house in Clarks Hay, South Cerney. The Parish Council believes that this 
 is in breach of Listed Building regulations as they are within the curtilage of 
 the public house which is a listed building. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Doris Land complained that no provision was made 
 for disabled users of the new toilets (i.e. no level access) when recent 
 renovations were carried out at the Old George public house. This she states is 
 a breach in the compliance of the Disability Discrimination Act. She was also 
 concerned that there is no Access Officer appointed at CDC which she also says 
 is in breach of the Act. The Clerk will inform the Enforcement Officer at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce suspects that the building on Lake 75 is in 
 breach of the occupancy conditions as laid down by CDC. The Clerk will inform 
 the Enforcement Officer at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had the 
 meeting at 9:42pm.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb complained about the distribution of Council Tax 
 collected from holiday homes. Cllr Messenger (CDC) explained to him that the 
 CDC collected the tax on behalf of Gloucestershire County Council which then 
 returned an amount for local distribution. This year GCC informed the CDC that 
 this arrangement had been cancelled. CDC retorted as this was the case it 
 refused to make the collection. GCC countered that the CDC would have to 
 contribute to the new recycling centre in its district which was forecast to 
 cost something in the region of £90 million. CDC agreed to make the collection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb requested the Clerk to ask for a copy of the log 
 of cleaning on the Spine Road. The Clerk will contact Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger (CDC) awaited permission on behalf of the 
 Canal Trust for the erection of double sided signs indicating the line of the 
 Severn &amp; Thames canal. Cllr Jay informed him that the South Cerney Trust would 
 discuss the proposal at its meeting next week. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb agreed to carry out their annual 
 survey of trees which were the responsibility of the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay was scathing in his comments describing the 
 rejection by CDC of a £5,000 bid from South Cerney Trust which had been 
 rejected as it did not satisfy the narrow criteria set by the funding 
 organisation. The fund concerned was now asking for further bids of £500 to use 
 up the remaining amount. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay queried the motivation of the CDC recycling 
 scheme? He complained that the operation was suspended over the Christmas and 
 New Year period which was the busiest time of the year. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman complained about the condition of Cerney 
 Wick Lane through the use of lorries moving earth to and from Lake 10. The 
 Clerk was asked to write to Sean Hodgson at Lake 10. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman complained that a leylandii hedge on 
 Station Road was obscuring the sight line for vehicles exiting Willow Grove. 
 The Clerk will inform Gloucestershire Highways</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart made the following report on the progress of 
 the SARA scheme: </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">“Since last month’s meeting we have made further steps re 
 the SARA scheme. Following the full day’s training at Glos Constabulary HQ, 
 attended by Ian Kennedy, Charles Kingsbury and myself, we requested a further 
 discussion on how to apply the scheme to this village/ parish. On Monday 7th 
 Jan, Ian and I met PCSO Lesley Pooley and our suggestion is to set up an event 
 to promote the reduction of crime in South Cerney Parish. As there are already 
 seven Neighbourhood Watch schemes running in the parish we feel that the 
 participants in those schemes should form the nucleus of the new system. A get 
 together in the Village Hall with those people, as many Parish Councillors as 
 possible plus some other ‘like minded’ people will be arranged with hopefully 
 Les Haines the Crime Reduction Officer of CDC taking the chair. After that 
 initial meeting we should hopefully be able to set up a group to carry the 
 scheme forward thus getting many more people involved in reducing crime and the 
 fear of crime in our community. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Why this is required is set out in the Crime and Disorder 
 Act 1998 Section 17. From the date that Act became law, the responsibility for 
 crime reduction and prevention ceased to be solely that of the Police Forces. 
 The Act stated that all local councils now have a legal requirement to work in 
 conjunction with every other appropriate agency and authority to reduce crime 
 and the causes of crime. We also have an obligation under the Act to record how 
 we as a council, do in fact consider those requirements in ALL our decisions! I 
 quote “Without prejudice to any other obligations imposed on it, it shall be 
 the duty of each authority to which this section applies to exercise its 
 various functions with due regard to the likely effect of the exercise of those 
 functions on, and the need to do all that it reasonably can to prevent, crime 
 and disorder in its area”. How we do that is anyone’s guess and this scheme 
 will probably die in the same way that the “Designing Out Crime” initiative 
 died some seven years ago. However in the mean time we should be seen to be 
 doing our bit as there is a lot to be gained by involving the community in 
 reducing crime. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Incidentally, the Act also states that “Town and Parish 
 Councils will be key partners. By definition they are very close to the 
 communities they serve and have a very good understanding of the range of 
 issues of concern to local people. They may be able to provide a valuable local 
 dimension when it comes to taking the community’s view on crime and disorder 
 problems of the area implementing the subsequent strategy.” </p>
