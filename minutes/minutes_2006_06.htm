  The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart welcomed a delegation from
Cerney Wick which included Jeannie Adam, Ron Jeffrey and Pauline Rau. The group wished
to inform Parish Councillors about their plans to convert Holy Trinity Church in Cerney Wick
into a dual purpose facility to provide church activities and a place which villagers could use
for community activities and social events. Jeannie Adam related the history of the church
which had been built in 1847 to the present day. She confirmed that the building now needed
extensive attention and a model was displayed to show the planned alterations. The village hall
had been built in the 1920s and as it had deteriorated dramatically a marquee had been
purchased to supplement its use. Options were presented to village residents and of the 90%
of those over 18 years old who voted, over 70% were in favour of the dual purpose option. A
group to coordinate the plan has been formed with the title Trinity Trust and that is currently
trying to clarify the position with the Diocese and create a lease. To proceed it would be
necessary to resolve the ownership of the land of the village hall but ownership is not
important as the Diocese has written to Rev J. Calvert informing him that it has no interest in
the proceeds of the sale. Cllr Stuart queried what provision was planned for disabled users and
would access be provided to the mezzanine floor. Overall Cllr Jay said that the plan was an
excellent idea and asked if the building would be licensed. He also asked if the Church would
have objection to any activities. Jeannie Adam said that discussions were ongoing with the
Diocese which was being extremely helpful as this project was a first in its area and as a pilot
scheme the Diocese was eager that it should succeed. As Trinity Trust was keen to work with
the Parish Council Cllr Squire suggested that the scheme be entered into the Village Plan. Cllr
Stuart did not envisage a problem and instructed the Clerk to make amending the Village Plan
to incorporate Trinity Trust an agenda item for next month’s meeting. <br>

 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.35pm.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MR DAVE SMITH</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce informed the meeting that Dave Smith from 
 Cerney Wick, who had been a Parish Councillor in the late 1980s and early 
 1990s, had sadly passed away. His funeral will take place on Wednesday 21st 
 June at Holy Trinity Church, Cerney Wick.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Apologies had been received for Cllr Mrs Chapman who had been 
 taken into hospital in Swindon on Sunday 11th June and Cllr Mrs Pollard who was 
 on holiday. Cllr Webb and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) apologised for their absence as 
 both were attending a session of the Cotswold Water Park Parish Liaison Joint 
 Committee.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2109: Item 29 ... amend “Trolman” to read “Trotman”</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Jay 
 that the Minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. With the exception 
 of Cllr Smith, who abstained as he was not present at the meeting, the Parish 
 Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">With the agreement of the Parish Council the Chairman, 
 Cllr Stuart promoted this next agenda item.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Thomas Nicholas and Dom Brown representatives of the YPC 
 were warmly welcomed to the meeting by the Chairman. Dom Brown asked directly 
 how could the YPC access money. Cllr Smith, Chairman of the Finance Committee 
 explained that an account had been opened but it would operate with exactly the 
 same protocols as the existing Parish Council current account. Members of the 
 YPC could not sign cheques but requests for payment could be made for approval 
 by the Parish Council. Cllr Nicholas suggested that the YPC operates as a 
 committee of the Parish Council in the same way as the other committees. 
 Payment proposals would be presented to the Finance Committee who would 
 determine a recommendation for approval by the Parish Council. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour of this procedure. Dom Brown then explained that the 
 YPC wanted to purchase a computer memory stick. The Parish Council was in 
 agreement. If details of the item and supplier were given to the Clerk he would 
 organise the deal. Dom Brown invited members of the Finance Committee to attend 
 a meeting of the YPC, yet to be arranged. All were in favour. The YPC was 
 organising a Fun Run and Barbecue for Sunday 10th September on Upper Up playing 
 fields. The Parish Council was in favour and some Parish Councillors 
 volunteered to take part in the exercise.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CLLR C. BENNETT (CDC)</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman permitted Cllr Bennett (CDC) to make his 
 report at this point as he had another appointment that evening. Cllr Bennett 
 (CDC) informed the Parish Council that he would liaise closely with Cllr Stuart 
 to try and access some of the new grant funds available through the CDC. He 
 reported that GCC was recruiting 63 extra divisional police and one was being 
 dedicated to our county electoral Ward.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 11th May I attended the RIAT briefing at RAF 
 Fairford. During May, of the 14 available working days, reduced because I took 
 part of my holiday entitlement, I averaged 4 hours 15 minutes per day which 
 exceeded my contract by some 40 minutes per day. This was mainly accounted for 
 due to the extra work involved in preparing for the Annual Parish Meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Jim Parker’s Tree <br>
 Cllr Squire had contacted a gas board official regarding damage caused to Jim 
 Parker’s tree and was hopeful of a pecuniary result. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING FROM ANNUAL PARISH MEETING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart suggested points from the reports and 
 discussions at the APM on which action should be taken.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewerage and Foul Odours</b> <br>
 Continue to press Thames Water Utilities Ltd to rectify these problems. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Filthy state of Spine and adjacent roads</b> <br>
 Continue to agitate for action to be taken against the drivers of vehicles 
 causing the mud. This was also mentioned on page 4 in the Police Report </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traffic Calming Measures</b> <br>
 Continue to pressurise Gloucestershire Highways to complete these jobs. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Plan</b> <br>
 Work towards completion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traffic Plan</b> <br>
 This is part of the Village Plan and also suggested by Mr Midgley, 
 Gloucestershire Highways. Implement as soon as possible through working with 
 Gloucestershire Highways and volunteers in the village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>“Smart Water”</b> <br>
 Ask the Gloucestershire Constabulary to action their promise to promote the use 
 of this in the village.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Section 106 contributions forWildlife Scheme</b>
 <br>
 Work with District Council members and other parties in village to activate 
 this. Cllr Jay stated that the Parish Council must be seen to be doing 
 something constructive in order to achieve a result. The Clerk was instructed 
 to write to Ann Edwards school to advise them of this source of funding and 
 check with Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) and CDC as to its availability. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dog Mess</b> <br>
 Work with all relevant agencies to minimise this problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cotswold Water Park</b> <br>
 Car parks and footpaths in the Parish that used to be maintained by CWP are now 
 being neglected. Find out what, if anything is to be done by CWP and if not 
 locate other sources to do whatever works are necessary. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay said that the report by police Inspector Steve 
 Williams was overly long in its presentation and effectively hijacked a 
 substantial part of the meeting. The Parish Council agreed to discuss the 
 format of the APM and how to anticipate and prevent a similar instance at 
 future Annual Parish Meetings during its January meeting next year.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 12th June. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ELECTION OF OFFICERS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce proposed and Cllr Mrs Chubb seconded a motion 
 that Cllr Squire continues as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee. Cllr Squire was duly elected unanimously as Chairman. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce proposed and Cllr Harris seconded a motion 
 that Cllr Stuart continues as Vice Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee. Cllr Stuart was duly elected unanimously as Vice 
 Chairman.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Housing Survey Strategy</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that Ms Sinead Barker had not made any request that a 
 housing survey be carried out. The Clerk was asked to remind her of the 
 agreement reached at a meeting of Parish Councillors prior to the May Parish 
 Council meeting. The Clerk informed the Parish Council that Ms Barker had 
 emailed a draft housing survey which would be discussed later in this Parish 
 Council meeting as an agenda item. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cotswold Play Partnership</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had attended on 15th May at CDC regarding 
 the awarding of grants. CDC had been awarded £200,000 for distribution from a 
 lottery grant but Cllr Stuart was not convinced that much of this money could 
 be accessed by South Cerney because of the strict criteria.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>New PCSO</b> <br>
 PCSO Lesley Pooley has been appointed as replacement for PCSO Ian Yeomans who 
 has been relocated.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Honey Combed Safety Surface</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire had successfully contacted Technix Rubber Ltd who informed him of a 
 strategy to reinvigorate the safety surface. The Committee agreed that a 
 specification be provided for suitable contractors based on the following 
 requirements: The safety surface at Robert Franklin Way play area around the 
 360 degree apparatus and senior swings should be lifted and all centres 
 cleaned. The surface beneath swept clean of existing material and removed down 
 to the geotextile surface. The honey combed surface to be joined with cable 
 ties at 9 inch centres to form a continuous mat. To avoid a trip hazard the 
 edges of the honey comb should be pegged, buried and overlapped with turf as 
 necessary. When laid the honey comb surface should be filled with a peat loam 
 mix and the area then sown over with a play area mix of grass seed. Cllr Stuart 
 and Cllr Harris had jointly inspected the safety surfaces after the meeting and 
 had come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to create a 
 specification for the refurbishment. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris then declared a prejudicial interest as a 
 potential contractor and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart explained that when the surface is lifted for 
 repair other factors will more than likely come into consideration and until 
 then these are not possible to predict. Cllr Stuart suggested that James Harris 
 Contracting, as a trusted supplier, be given permission to reinstate the safety 
 surfaces at his quoted hourly rate of £18. Refurbishment of the surfaces was 
 considered a matter of urgency with school summer holidays imminent and the 
 consequent extra use of the play area anticipated. It was proposed by Cllr 
 Squire and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that James Harris Contracting be awarded 
 the refurbishment of the honeycombed safety surfaces at Robert Franklin Way 
 play area. The Parish Council was all in favour. Cllr Stuart volunteered to 
 help James Harris carry out the task. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Highway Matters</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to enquire from Martyn Midgley, Area Programme Manager - 
 East (Cotswold Division), Gloucestershire Highways when alterations to the 
 speed roundels could be expected. Mr Midgley had indicated in a recent email 
 that the interactive speed limit signs should be installed within 3 months. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the slide and its base will be removed by the Pay 
 Back in the Community group as soon as possible. Various other local 
 commitments had prevented them carrying out the task. The Committee agreed that 
 Cllr Stuart could order a skip for the resulting overmatter.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cricket Club Pavilion <br>
 </b>Painting of the outside was currently in progress. New vandal proof window 
 panes will be installed. Cllr Squire suggested that the Parish Council might 
 consider making a contribution to the new glass.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Tennis Club Patio</b> <br>
 As a matter of urgency the Clerk was requested to inform the Tennis Club to 
 repair the broken flagstones in its patio as the loose pieces were being used 
 as ammunition by vandals to attack the Cricket Club pavilion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Water Park Questions</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb will attend a meeting of the Cotswold Water Park Joint Liaison 
 Committee as Parish Council representative on Wednesday 14th June.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the new signs had been placed at the entrance to the 
 play area. The rest of the play area was in good order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported the area underneath the fencing surrounding the toddlers 
 play area needed to be strimmed. One hand hold on the spinner was loose. 
 Potholes in the vicinity of the senior swings needed to be filled and the 
 safety matting needed attention. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the edges of the play surfaces around senior swing 
 and activity area still needed to be built up. A supply of top soil would need 
 to be sourced. Although there was little evidence of litter at the cycle mounds 
 in general the problem is increasing despite the efforts of Eddie Curtis and 
 others in removing it. The windows in the cricket club had all been vandalised 
 but the painting had commenced. Trees will need watering if the hot weather 
 persists and some weed growth will needed to be removed from both the tree 
 bases and the adjacent path. Two screws on the Cricket Club’s cesspool lid were 
 missing. The surface of the car park is showing signs of wear and has several 
 potholes. The byelaws notice needs to be updated and renewed. There was too 
 much dog mess around the pond and a wheel barrow had been dumped in the pond 
 and needs to be removed. Cllr Harris interjected to inform the meeting that the 
 wheel barrow and old mattress had now been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GRASS CUTTING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Squire had received 
 complaints about the quality of grass cutting in Station Road, Church Lane and 
 the churchyard. Cllr Harris reported in his Inspection that the area underneath 
 the fence surrounding the toddlers area and behind the seats needed to be 
 strimmed. Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) had emailed a complaint about grass being left 
 on the highway after the contractor had mowed the area in Meadow Way. The Clerk 
 will inform the contractor. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas remarked that the weeds in and around the 
 Old Cross needed attention. Cllr Jay volunteered to remove them. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ANNUAL INSPECTION OF PLAY AREAS AND EQUIPMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">One of the requirements of the report by Mr Hicks was that 
 signage of the wheeled sports area should include the strongest recommendations 
 relating to the use of protective clothing including helmets as well as gloves, 
 knee and elbow guards. Mr Hicks however, did point out that risk of injury is 
 implicit and inevitable. The overall report did not refer to any major</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Councillors’ Reports</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the Cotswold Water Park Society 
 had put a message on the bridleway barrier of the old railway line at Robert 
 Franklin Way play area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris requested approval to attend a forum to 
 discuss minerals planning issues in Gloucestershire at the Royal Agricultural 
 College, Cirencester on 11th July. The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris then declared a prejudicial interest in this 
 next item as a potential contractor and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Stuart 
 that James Harris Contracting be instructed to replace the missing handrail, as 
 a matter of urgency, at the base of the steps on the bridge near Bow Wow. The 
 Committee was all in favour. Cllr Nicholas proposed and Cllr Smith seconded 
 that the Parish Council accepts the recommendation of the Playing Fields and 
 Village Maintenance Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris volunteered to organise the watering of the 
 trees at Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to write to Simon Gray, Housing 
 Officer at Fosseway Housing Association Ltd to request that organisation cut 
 the grass at the entrance to Jubilee Gardens. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed with Cllr Stuart who described the 
 new steps which had been installed in the river adjacent to Upper Mill in 
 School Lane as hideous and out of keeping with other structures in this part of 
 the Conservation Area. The Clerk was asked to inform the Environment Agency. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire was concerned with the amount of litter around 
 the bins in the vicinity of Londis, Broadway Lane. The Clerk was asked to 
 inform Londis of its responsibilities under the Clean Neighbourhoods and 
 Environment Act which requires local businesses to help clear up litter they 
 generate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay asked that the Committee agrees to a request from 
 Bristol University for permission to launch its new balloon from Upper Up 
 playing fields on 22nd July. The Committee was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CLLR S. PARSONS (GCC) </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman permitted Cllr Parsons (GCC) to make his 
 report at this point as he had another appointment that evening. Cllr Parsons (GCC) 
 replied to Cotswold Water Park questions from the Parish Council through a 
 prepared statement. He explained how the CWP was financed through equal 
 tranches of money from the four main local authorities of £35,000 per annum. 
 The CWP receives from the Joint Committee £135,000 per annum through the 
 Partnership Grant Agreement. This Agreement specifies the range of work which 
 the Joint Committee wishes the Society to undertake in the 12 months covered by 
 the Agreement with the expectation that the Society will raise additional funds 
 for the work to supplement the Joint Committee funding. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In recognition that there had not been a fundamental 
 review of the Partnership Grant Agreement for some time, a review was 
 undertaken earlier this year. It was clear that the expectation of desirable 
 work did not equate with the funds available The review therefore focused on 
 identifying priorities for 2006-07 which could be delivered with the funding 
 realistically available. A consequence of this process was that a number of 
 items were removed from the programme of desirable works for the time being for 
 further consideration in due course. One of the items removed was the 
 improvement of the free car parks although maintenance is still included. This 
 issue will require further detailed discussions during the course of this year. 
 An appropriate Risk Assessment may well be part of these discussions. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay complained that the car park on Station Road was 
 not being maintained. Cllr Parsons welcomed the feedback and advised that local 
 representatives Roger Sleeman the Gloucestershire representative and Carole 
 Ames the Wiltshire representative be informed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">One of the principal purposes of the Cotswold Water Park 
 ‘partnership’ is to provide ‘value for money’. The local authorities work with 
 the Society, as a charitable organisation, who secure additional funding from 
 other sources, work closely with businesses and the community in the area and 
 also deliver services to implement the policies of the Joint Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Cotswold Water Park Society would define ‘value for 
 money’ as a means of obtaining the maximum benefit from goods and services 
 acquired and provided with available resources. This involves an assessment of 
 cost, quality, fitness for purpose, timeliness and convenience. As a charitable 
 organisation the CWP Society strictly monitors any spending using the above 
 criteria. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris questioned who benefited from 2nd homes 
 council tax. Cllr Parsons calculated approximately that £291,000 was going back 
 to communities. Cllr Jay complained that CDC had provided an opportunity to bid 
 for some of this fund, laid down criteria and when applications were considered 
 it changed the types of project it would award. Cllr Parsons (GCC) advised that 
 complaints of this nature should be made to local District Councillors.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith reported on the discussions of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on 12th June.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;ELECTION OF OFFICERS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Webb 
 that Cllr Smith remains as Chairman of the Finance Committee. The Committee was 
 all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Nicholas 
 that Cllr Jay remains as Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee. The Committee 
 was all in favour.</p>

 £400 from the CDC for YPC business. A further £90 donation from Ms Helen

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/S</b> <br>
 Cable tow waterski course with clubhouse/restaurant/swimming pool/ health club 
 (Resubmission) at Lake 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney (R) <br>
 The Parish Council objects to this application for the reasons stated below. If 
 consent is to be granted, then the Parish Council proposes the conditions 
 specified:– <br>
 1. The proposed new vehicular access from Cerney Wick Lane, on the south 
 eastern side of the site (referred to as ‘Access 3’ on page 15 of the Transport 
 Assessment (TA) dated April 2006) would cause an unacceptable increase in the 
 volume of traffic using this minor road. All vehicular access should, so far as 
 possible, be direct from the B4696 ‘Spine Road’. <br>
 2. The 1999 and 2002 traffic surveys referred to in the TA are not sufficiently 
 recent. The Parish Council is very concerned about the inevitable increase in 
 traffic volumes that will be generated by the other substantial developments 
 which already have permission in the area. Therefore, the road junction of 
 Cerney Wick Lane, Station Road and the Spine Road should be redesigned to 
 accept that traffic increase. The junction should be fundamentally improved and 
 upgraded in the interests of safety, with traffic lights included, as described 
 in paragraph 4.12 of the TA. <br>
 3. A public pedestrian and cycle path should be included as part of the 
 development, right around the south western and south eastern perimeter of the 
 site, and onwards to Cerney Wick. Having considered the TA, and also bearing in 
 mind all the existing developments which have planning permission in the area, 
 the overall traffic levels along the Spine Road and down Cerney Wick Lane will 
 increase substantially (whether or not Access 3 is added). Much greater 
 attention will need to be paid to all aspects of road safety. Cerney Wick Lane 
 is already somewhat hazardous for road users, particularly walkers, cyclist and 
 horse riders. <br>
 4. The Parish Council remains very concerned that the public main sewerage 
 infrastructure in South Cerney must first be proven to be capable of 
 accommodating the additional volumes that will be created by this development.
 <br>
 5. The existing earth bund along the south eastern boundary of the site should 
 only be removed if an appropriate condition is included to prevent undue noise 
 (such as public address sound systems) from the site. The bund currently 
 provides a sound barrier, reducing the level of noise from Lake 11 (and from 
 the Spine Road) that reaches the residents of Cerney Wick. <br>
 6. The Parish Council is concerned that the documents provided to the Parish 
 Council contain no indication as to the colour or texture of the roofing tiles, 
 walls or other such external materials to be used for the buildings on this 
 development. <br>
 7. The ground level on the south side of the site has been built up by at least 
 0.5 metre. This level should be reduced, so that any new properties are on 
 ground that is at the same level as the road, and not at an increased level, to 
 reduce any adverse affect on the visual amenity of the area. <br>

 fundamentally change the character of this rural location as viewed from the

 appearance of the proposed buildings. The amended plans still show no details 
 describing the roof colour to be used. Permission should not be granted until 
 the sewage problems affecting South Cerney have been resolved. Conditions 
 requested if permission is granted are as follows: 1. A wheel-wash to be 
 mandatory for all vehicles exiting the site during construction. 2. A dedicated

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had concerns over the design of the draft 
 questionnaire which had been supplied by Sinead Barker. He complained that the 
 survey would take five sides of A4, four of which would be surplus if the 
 person filling out the form was not in need of housing. Cllr Nicholas said that 
 the item would need a sensitive method of presentation and should be discussed 
 by the Planning Committee. He invited Parish Councillors to feed any comments 
 to him and asked that the survey be made an agenda item for next month’s 
 meeting of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>LOCALAUTHORITY BYELAWS IN ENGLAND</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The document was summarised by Cllr Jay who stated that as 
 some of the byelaws were being superseded it would be prudent to wait for the 
 White Paper before making comment. Cllr Squire commented that it was a good 
 document. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CHARTER 88</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart read the introductory letter describing the 
 aims of Charter 88 and its campaign for a modern democracy empowering citizens 
 and local councils by supporting the Sustainable Communities Bill. During a 
 short discussion Cllr Nicholas said that he was not personally convinced with 
 the objectives and thought that the group was fundamentally misguided and 
 naive. There was no enthusiasm from Parish Councillors to offer their support 
 although Cllr Stuart was minded to attend a public meeting arranged by Charter 
 88 on 22nd June in Stroud.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart referred to an item, which did not appear in 
 Correspondence, regarding a consultation on the provision of Mental Health 
 facilities in Gloucestershire which was to run from 22 May to 23 June. However, 
 in view of the fact that the document was not issued until last week this 
 Parish Council calls upon the Gloucestershire Partnership NHS Trust to declare 
 the consultation invalid on the grounds that insufficient time has been given 
 for consultees to consider the implications and transmit their views to the 
 appropriate person. Six weeks, at least, was required for such a consultation.</p>
