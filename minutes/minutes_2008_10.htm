 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge that the minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. Cllr 
 Stuart abstained as he had not attended the meeting. The remainder of the 
 Parish Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the YPC was in attendance. Cllr Nicholas 
 explained that the new school term had brought a life style change to the 
 travelling habits of both Joe Lodge and Sinead Peare who both had to commute to 
 their college at an earlier time, which in turn lead to a longer and more 
 exhausting day.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING FROM PREVIOUS MINUTES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman complained that the advertisements were 
 still on display on the fence of Lake 11. The Clerk will remind the Enforcement 
 Officer of his previous request to investigate the matter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traffic Plan</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas enquired on how the Traffic Plan was to progress. The Clerk would 
 email Cllr Stuart with a list of those who had volunteered so far. Cllr Stuart 
 will liaise with Gloucestershire Constabulary to see if it could help through 
 its previous experiences with such plans and he would report back to the Parish 
 Council at the November meeting. Cllr Jay will meet with Peter Redfern and try 
 to recruit him to join the team. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Millennium Seat, Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had selected a seat from a catalogue to replace the damaged one in 
 Bow Wow. The Clerk will inform Chris Franklin at Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MUGA Problems</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had met with “Don” from Park Leisure who had turned up to make 
 repairs and adjustments to the tarmac and kick wall. Further problems had been 
 identified with the goal end as some of the panels did not match the others. 
 The side members vary between 50mm and 60mm which has caused the differing gaps 
 to create finger traps. As it will probably be necessary to replace the 
 incorrect panels with new ones, Cllr Stuart suggested to Park Leisure’s 
 representative James McGrath that the company alters the position of the basket 
 ball hoop to be on the other face of the wall as at present the top side of the 
 tarmac area is not used enough and the repositioning of the hoop would widen 
 the scope for more children to play there. As a gesture of good will he 
 suggested that white or yellow lines marking out a “D” on that side would be 
 welcomed. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Harris who thanked Cllr Stuart 
 for all the work he had done on the installation. The Clerk was to ask the YPC 
 if it had any ideas on how the old basketball hoop area might be reused. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Area to west of cricket pitch</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the area to west of the cricket pitch and south of 
 the football pitch which had been prone to flooding in the past had the clay 
 surface removed and new drainage pipes installed by Murphy contractors. It will 
 need to be kept under surveillance but recent heavy rain had drained away 
 without consequence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 16th September I joined with Cllr Jay and Cllr 
 Stuart and attended a village meeting at Siddington to start the process there, 
 of a village plan. Cllr Stuart told the packed hall of the methods used to 
 produce the village plan for South Cerney. Cllr Jay explained how it now works 
 with the publication of its development both on the web site and on the notice 
 boards of this Committee Room. Jenny Cunningham from Poole Keynes spoke of how 
 its village plan had progressed since its inception in August 2003. One 
 interesting project she described was the existence of a skills base which had 
 been achieved by a survey of what services could be provided within the 
 village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 17th I attended a Planning Regulatory meeting 
 at CDC where the application for a new house in Ham Lane was decided. Cllr 
 Nicholas spoke of the Parish Council’s reasons for objecting, Carolyn Kennedy 
 argued for objection on behalf of neighbours of the site, Cllr Bennett (CDC) 
 spoke as a Ward Member of his objections, Cllr Clarke (CDC) had sent a note 
 objecting as he would not be able to attend most of the discussion and Cllr 
 Messenger (CDC) did not take advantage of the Chairperson’s invitation to make 
 a contribution. The committee voted 8-7 in favour of objecting to the 
 application. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Also on Wednesday 17th I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a 
 meeting with representatives from Park Leisure to discuss the short comings of 
 the recent installation of the Kick Wall and Youth Shelter on the MUGA. Park 
 Leisure assured us that the outstanding matters would be sorted out within the 
 next two weeks. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 22nd I joined Cllr Caunce, Cllr Harris, Cllr 
 Jay, Cllr Stuart in a meeting with Chris Franklin and Adam Thomas both from 
 Gloucestershire Highways to inspect the installation and effect of gabions 
 alongside the river bank of the Churn through Bow Wow. Cllr Harris pointed out 
 that the dry stone wall near to the bridge at the lane junction with Silver 
 Street was bulging towards the river. Gabion baskets throughout the stretch 
 were becoming exposed and drainage channels dug to relieve recent flooding were 
 responsible for the erosion of top soil from the bank. The damage to the 
 Millennium seat was pointed out and Chris Franklin agreed to replace the seat 
 with another which Cllr Stuart would select from a suppliers list. 
 Gloucestershire Highways would send a team to survey the work on the river 
 bank. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 23rd I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a meeting of 
 the Big Lottery Fund group at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 25th I attended the Beating of the Retreat at 
 Gloucester Barracks. During the ceremony I was escorted by Captain Frances Fox 
 who is secretary to the Silver Stars parachuting team. Capt Fox will consider a 
 request for the team to perform a jump to signify the official opening of the 
 MUGA at Upper Up if the Parish Council so decide. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During September of the 19 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours and 33 minutes per day which is par per day for my contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to liaise with the YPC to determine if 
 it agreed to the Silver Stars appearance and ascertain a preference time and 
 date for the event. If so, then he would contact its secretary and make the 
 arrangement subject to their availability.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th OCTOBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2450 – <b>Safety Surface at Upper Up</b>. The Clerk 
 had had an acknowledgement from George Taylor when he had reminded him that the 
 safety surface had not yet been repaired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2450 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards</b>. After 
 contacting Mrs Maureen Dunn, warden at Box Bush, Cllr Mrs Chubb will prepare a 
 questionnaire to ascertain if a shelter would be a viable asset for residents 
 in this part of the village. Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr Mrs Chubb for her work on 
 the project so far. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2450 – <b>Laurel Hedge at Pocket Park, Jubilee 
 Gardens</b>. Cllr Stuart will inspect the pruning of the hedge and report his 
 conclusion at the Parish Council meeting. Cllr Stuart reported that the hedge 
 had been well cut. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2450 – <b>Geoffrey Franklin’s Ditch.</b> Cllr Harris 
 had visited Mr Franklin and discussed the state of his ditches. He was unable 
 to persuade Mr Franklin to take any action to clear them but suggested that if 
 circumstances prevailed in the future, photographic evidence might be useful 
 evidence in convincing the land owner to change his attitude. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2451 – <b>Robert Franklin Way Inspection Report.</b> 
 Cllr Harris reported that no meeting had taken place with Cllr Walker to 
 reappraise the points raised in last month’s inspection report as suggested by 
 Cllr Caunce. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2452 – <b>Mr Stansfield’s Hedge</b>. The Clerk 
 concluded that after meeting with Mr Stansfield he would be willing under his 
 supervision, to allow the Parish Council to cut down his hedge alongside the 
 river Churn to provide a better view from the Millennium seat in Bow Wow. The 
 Clerk was asked to arrange a meeting with him and a small delegation of Parish 
 Councillors to discuss the matter further. Mr Stansfield had subsequently sent 
 an email confirming the discussion and raised some points which could be 
 addressed if a meeting was arranged. His concern over green issues could be 
 assuaged through explaining the activities of the Parish Council on its Upper 
 Up play area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b>. The completion of the work 
 was awaited. Cllr Caunce had been in contact with Betec which was aware of the 
 situation. It was agreed that payment for the work would be withheld until the 
 job had been passed as satisfactory. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow river bank</b>. During a meeting with Chris 
 Franklin and Adam Thomas both from Gloucestershire Highways, to inspect the 
 installation and effect of gabions alongside the river bank of the Churn 
 through Bow Wow, Cllr Harris had pointed out that the dry stone wall near to 
 the bridge at the lane junction with Silver Street was bulging towards the 
 river. Gabion baskets throughout the stretch were becoming exposed and drainage 
 channels dug to relieve recent flooding were responsible for the erosion of top 
 soil from the bank. The damage to the Millennium seat was pointed out and Chris 
 Franklin agreed to replace the seat with another which Cllr Stuart would select 
 from a suppliers list. Gloucestershire Highways would send a team to survey the 
 work on the river bank. An email had been received from Dave Ludford, Flood 
 Risk Management Officer at the Environment Agency notifying residents that 
 there will be an operation to remove gravel from the river Churn alongside 
 School Lane and Bow Wow and also at The Chapter Manor starting on 3rd November. 
 The Clerk will put his letter on the notice board in Clarks Hay. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>“Shorncote Link”</b> <br>
 Concern was raised by Cllr Jay that footpaths around the Keynes Country Park 
 were under threat of closure. It was pointed out that there was only one PROW 
 to the north of the park and other paths around the lakes were permissive. 
 Somerford Keynes was currently producing a definitive map which would show 
 existing PROW and highlight other pathways which might be included in the 
 system. South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council would support any 
 extension of the network and the Clerk was asked to inform Muriel Watkins, 
 Clerk at Somerford Keynes that this Council supported their ideals. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path from Kingfisher Place to Huxley Court</b>.
 <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he had been unable to contact the Payback in the 
 Community Team to negotiate with them a scheme for the reinstatement of the 
 path. Cllr Nicholas suggested that John-Charles Kimberley of the Cotswold 
 Forest School and his group might be willing to become involved. Cllr Stuart 
 would investigate this possibility.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 On Monday no report had been received from Cllr Walker although he had 
 subsequently emailed it to the Clerk. Cllr Walker then proceeded to make his 
 report to the meeting. The lock mechanism had been removed from the gate at the 
 toddlers play area; the knobs on the spinner had all been burnt; the platform 
 on the 360 deg swing were loose and needed to be tightened; the seat on the 
 senior swing is damaged and needs to be changed; empty cans in the hedge were 
 evidence that drinking was taking place and Cllr Walker suggests that the PCSO 
 be asked to monitor occasionally. The Clerk will determine the size and make of 
 a replacement seat for the senior swing and order accordingly.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that the repair to the safety surface at the Activity 
 Area was still awaited. The Cycle Mounds were in good condition and much used 
 by a wide range of age groups. The MUGA was still not completed despite 
 assurances from the manufacturer. Murphy contractors had completed the 
 “Shorncote Link” path to the bridge site and in so doing had used in excess of 
 100 tonnes of aggregate. The chestnut fencing had been removed last Saturday. 
 Further drainage works were in progress.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play area and equipment were all in good order..</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was agreed that Finance Committee accepts the following 
 recommendation: The invoice presented by R.O.W. Berry to repair the picnic 
 table at Robert Franklin Way play area be paid. Cllr Stuart will report on 
 Wednesday if the payment for the pruning of the laurel hedge on the Pocket Park 
 should be made. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Minor alterations to the ground maintenance specification 
 had been agreed. The Clerk was asked to email the document to members of the 
 committee for further scrutiny. The Clerk reminded members of the committee 
 that two years previously GAPTC had advised that the Parish Council cease the 
 practice of tending the grass in the churchyards of South Cerney and Cerney 
 Wick to avoid any potential litigation which might arise through the actions of 
 its contractors. If minded, the Parish Council could make a grant to the church 
 authorities to subsidise any contractors it might select. If the Parish Council 
 was in agreement the Clerk should inform Mr T. Squire, Church Warden of this 
 revised arrangement. Cllr Jay and Cllr Webb objected to this change in the 
 contract. Discussions would continue and the Parish Council would be given an 
 opportunity to vote on the change at a later date. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROVISION OF A DOG MESS BIN AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE 
 ALLOTMENTS IN CHURCH LANE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It had been proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr 
 Caunce that the Parish Council agrees to the provision of a dog mess bin at the 
 entrance to the allotments in Church Lane. The committee had been all in 
 favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the Parish Council agrees to the provision of a dog mess bin at the 
 entrance to the allotments in Church Lane. The Parish Council was all in 
 favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROVISION OF A SEAT OR SEATS IN THE BUS SHELTER IN THE 
 LIMES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart argued that if seats were installed then the 
 shelter would become a site for the gathering of youths which may lead to 
 unsatisfactory behaviour. He further stated that there was a seat just outside 
 the shelter which could be used by those waiting for public transport. The 
 Clerk recalled that some 10 years previously when he become Clerk, a decision 
 had been taken to remove the seating as a direct result of the misbehaviour of 
 youths then. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Caunce that no 
 seats should be provided in the shelter at this time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>NOTIFICATION OF TREE WORK BY CDC</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It had come to the notice of Cllr Harris that the 
 procedure for notifying the Parish Council of tree work within the Conservation 
 Area, Tree Protection Orders and response times had been changed. The Clerk had 
 spoken with Mark Berry CDC who confirmed that tree planning issues will be only 
 given 7 days consultation period and no documents or closing date for comments 
 information will be available on the web site. The committee was not happy with 
 the new arrangements which did not facilitate meaningful consultation and 
 wished to make its District Councillors aware.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no reports at the Committee meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Coordinating action for the improvement of the permissive 
 path, subject to the approval of the owners, from Kingfisher Place to Huxley 
 Court was added to the list. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce closed the 
 committee meeting at 8:25pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th
 OCTOBER</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart apologised for his absence as he was attending 
 a singing practice. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Draft Minutes of Previous Meeting</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2453 – Cllr Nicholas pointed that the expenditure for 
 the MUGA should have been recorded in column “X” and not “XX” column of the 
 spreadsheet. The Clerk will alter accordingly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cotswold Children and Young People’s Thematic 
 Partnership Grant</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay would like to record his grateful thanks to Cllr P. Clarke (CDC) for 
 his efforts in extracting the information from the District Council on which 
 parishes had been successful in gaining a grant.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay stated that an analysis of the spread sheet showed that expenditure 
 was in line with expectations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations of the Playing Field and Village 
 Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 The following recommendation had been made: the invoice presented by R.O.W. 
 Berry to repair the picnic table at Robert Franklin Way play area be paid. Cllr 
 Stuart will report on Wednesday if the payment for the pruning of the laurel 
 hedge on the Pocket Park should be made. Cllr Stuart confirmed that the hedge 
 had been cut well.</p>

     Cllr Jay reported that he had carried out an internal audit of the Parish 
     Council’s accounts. He had thoroughly checked the trail of one in eight of

     to compliment the Clerk on his book-keeping. </p>
     <p><b>Cllr Walker’s Resignation</b> <br>
     At the committee meeting Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to enquire from the 
     Monitoring Officer at CDC if there was a provision within the Local 
     Authorities (Members’ Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003 to recover 
     part of a Parish Councillor’s allowance if a councillor ceased to hold 
     office. </p>
     <p>At the Parish Council meeting Cllr Walker was asked to leave the room as 
     he had a prejudicial interest in this debate. Cllr Walker left the room. </p>
     <p>Nigel Adams, CDC Monitoring Officer had informed the Clerk that normally 
     allowances would be paid on a monthly basis in arrears. As the Parish 
     Council had opted to pay the allowance in advance it could now ask for the 
     unused portion, based on a monthly average, to be returned. Parish 
     Councillors argued that if the allowance had been used it would be 
     inappropriate to recover any part of it as Cllr Walker had come to the end 
     of his military career and had to leave the area to find housing elsewhere 
     and through no fault of his own had to resign as a Parish Councillor. It 
     was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish 
     Council does not ask Cllr Walker to repay any of his awarded allowance. The 
     Parish Council was all in favour. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th
 OCTOBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas had opened the meeting at 9pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart apologised for his absence as he was attending a singing practice..</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>06/00525/FUL CT.2648/3/P</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb asked that conditions 14 and 15 which had been imposed on the granted 
 application for the lodges on Lake 10, Waters Edge, Cerney Wick Lane were 
 investigated as he was concerned that they were not being observed. The Clerk 
 will inform the Enforcement Officer at CDC. <br>
 14. Prior to the commencement of development, visibility splays of 4.5m x 120m 
 due northeast and 4.5m x 45m due south west of the proposed vehicular access 
 shall be cleared of all obstructions to visibility of a height greater than 
 600mm and shall be maintained as such thereafter. Reason: In the interests of 
 highway safety. <br>
 15. No building work shall commence on the lodges hereby approved until a 
 passing bay has been constructed on Cerney Wick Lane, in accordance with full 
 design and construction details, which shall have been submitted to and 
 approved by the Local Planning Authority beforehand. The passing bay shall then 
 be kept clear of all obstruction thereafter. Reason: In the interests of 
 highway safety. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Local Development Framework</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas expects that there will be a wider level of 
 interest among Parish Councillors other than the Planning Committee in this 
 plan. Consequently he suggested that interested members of the Parish Council 
 should form a sub-committee and meet to discuss a single item agenda on the 
 issue at a date and time to be arranged. The Clerk was asked to invite Tiina 
 Emsley, Principal Planning Policy Officer at CDC to a meeting with Parish 
 Councillors prior to the Parish Council meeting in November or December to 
 discuss how best to proceed with collating information suitable for inclusion 
 in the LDF.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications received by CDC</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce and Cllr Harris both declared a prejudicial 
 interest in the following application as the applicant was a business associate 
 and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>07/03605/FUL (Amendment)</b> <br>
 Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney GL7 5TL <br>
 Proposal: Amendment to previously approved scheme of holiday lodges Plots 25-50 
 only at Lake 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney (R) <br>
 The Parish Council objects to this application because the proposed new 
 vehicular entrance on to Cerney Wick Lane would increase the traffic problems 
 at the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Spine Road (B4696) and Station Road. It 
 would, as a matter of course, cause an increase in the volume of traffic 
 accessing the Spine Road at that junction. It is already a dangerous junction, 
 with the volume of traffic increased substantially as a result of extensive 
 developments in this area in recent years. <br>
 It should be noted that condition 4 of planning permission CT.2648/3/J states:
 <br>
 “Notwithstanding the submitted drawings, no permission is hereby granted or 
 implied for any new access for motor vehicles onto or from Cerney Wick Lane.”&nbsp;
 <br>
 If permission is to be granted, the Parish Council believes that it would be 
 appropriate for the following conditions be imposed (if necessary, by way of an 
 appropriate section 106 Agreement): 1. That the developer must fund the full 
 cost of installing traffic lights at the Spine Road/Cerney Wick Lane/Station 
 Road junction. 2. That the speed limit on the Spine Road, either side of that 
 junction, should be limited to 40mph. <br>
 OBJECTION <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish 
 Council ratifies the decision of the Planning Committee and objects to this 
 application. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce and Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart declared a prejudicial interest in this next 
 application as he was a close neighbour and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>08/02691/LBC (Listed Building Consent)</b> <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the committee meeting at 9.40pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>AMENDMENT TO STANDING ORDER No 55</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay referred to Standing Order 75 for guidance. 
 Accordingly after discussion it was proposed by Cllr Walker and seconded by 
 Cllr Jay that the Parish Council intends to delete sub sections 55 (a) and (b) 
 and replace them with: “The Council shall approve its estimates for the coming 
 financial year at its meeting in the month of January.” The motion would stand 
 adjourned without discussion to the next ordinary meeting of the Council. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MAINTENANCE OF LAND IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce refreshed Parish Councillors memories by 
 explaining that this item had been adjourned at last month’s meeting as Cllr 
 Stuart was absent and had been involved in discussions with a contractor. Cllr 
 Stuart explained that after talking with Dave Buckley from Glebe Contractors he 
 had decided that the idea of specifying in detail all the tasks was altogether 
 too challenging and it would be best to continue with the current procedure 
 which was to react to demand. Parish Councillors agreed to a suggestion from 
 Cllr Nicholas that an entry to the present specification could be added which 
 asked contractors to stipulate a price per hour for extra ground maintenance 
 when needed. Cllr Harris suggested that such a condition should be subject to a 
 specified response within a stipulated time. Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr Harris 
 for raising the concept overall.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that the Composting group was 
 meeting on a regular basis. Cllr Nicholas was aware that the scheme was not 
 covered by the Village Plan, nevertheless he requested that the Parish Council 
 should be minded to support the group and its planned activities. Parish 
 Councillors did not object to the idea that £1,500 is made available as it was 
 considered a very laudable project. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked Cllr Clarke (CDC) what plans did CDC 
 have to monitor the occupancy of holiday homes. Cllr Clarke will enquire. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to request Gloucestershire 
 Highways to resurface Northmoor Lane as the surface was becoming very worn. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to enquire if there was any 
 further progress to report on the implementation of the street lighting scheme. 
 The Clerk will contact Barry Greenaway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that a resident of Box Bush had 
 highlighted an inconsistency in the road signs in Box Bush. Recently an 
 ambulance arrived, directed by its GPS to a house in Box Bush. Although the GPS 
 had located the property on its postcode detection program it was not 
 completely correct due to the way properties are numbered. The medic used his 
 mobile phone to signify his arrival to the caller but it was out of sight of 
 the emergency. What is needed is more precise signage of where the house 
 numbers are located. The Clerk will inform Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that a willow tree had fallen 150m 
 south on the canal tow path and was blocking the route on the South Cerney 
 side. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that she had noticed toxic 
 warning signs on Lake 6. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had attended the Beating of 
 the Retreat at the Duke of Gloucester Barracks on Thursday 25th September. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">He reminded Parish Councillors that Mary Mychaleckyj would 
 be making a presentation on behalf of Young Gloucestershire on Monday 13th 
 October at 5pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart was increasingly skeptical about the 
 partnership of Gloucestershire Constabulary and the community. Originally it 
 had been designed around a joint responsibility but for whatever reason in his 
 opinion this concept had lapsed. He suspected that police leaders had another 
 agenda, were not as enthusiastic as previously and PCSOs were also less than 
 cooperative. He had discussed his observations with Les Haines (CDC) pointing 
 out that a PCSO had dissembled information regarding the organisation of a SARA 
 meeting. He had a high regard for the efforts of PC Jon Palfrey and between 
 them had arranged an unscheduled Neighbourhood Panel meeting of SARA for Friday 
 14th November at 7.30pm in the Village Hall and asked that Parish Councillors 
 make every effort to attend. </p>
