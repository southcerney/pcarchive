    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF LAST MEETING</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Harris that the minutes as
    published were a true record. The meeting was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    There were no matters arising.<br>
    <br>
    Due to other commitments the report from P.C. George Lager (Gloucestershire Police) was
    promoted to next in the agenda<br>
    <strong>REPORT BY P.C. LAGER</strong><br>
    P.C. George Lager introduced himself as the Rural Beat Officer. This post could be
    described as a &quot;Rural Watch&quot; without impinging on Neighbourhood Watch. His
    &quot;beat&quot; included Horses, Public Houses, Churches, Schools etc and covered an area
    from Didmarton to Lechlade and Birdlip to Cricklade. Police Information Points would be
    installed and would include a noticeboard and confidential letter box contents of which
    would be collected on a weekly basis. This was not an ideal solution but was the second
    best and a step forward. There were 10 Rural Beat Officers in Gloucestershire with two
    currently assigned to the Cotswold District. To help the officers to carry out their
    duties a mobile police motor home, fully equipped with modern communications technology is
    being supplied. Gloucestershire is the first police district in the country to provide
    this service.<br>
    <strong>QUESTIONS</strong><br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr E. Curtis complained about traffic speeding in Broadway Lane. PC
    Lager asked for specific instances to be reported to him.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Stuart asked that the &quot;rat run&quot; through Upper Up and
    High Street be patrolled. PC Lager asked at what time? Cllr Stuart thought that between
    7am­9am. PC Lager noted his concern.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr R. Ducker asked when the mobile police motor home would be in
    operation. The Rural Police Panel had advised him that the vehicles would be arriving. PC
    Lager replied that sponsorship of £33,000 for five years viability had been secured.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Bride asked how many Constables were allocated to the South
    Cerney Beat as Inspector Wasley said last year that three had been allocated to the
    Parish. PC Lager replied that only two were allocated as &quot;the bodies&quot; were just
    not available.<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Stuart congratulated the Constabulary for their rapid response
    to a recent incident at 4am. It only took 8 minutes for a full response. PC Lager then
    left the meeting to return to duty.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CHAIRPERSON'S REPORT</strong><br>
    Having said that I would only serve one term as Chairperson I am still in the Chair and
    will be for the next year also. I would have sunk without trace had it not been for the
    Clerk, Maurice McKee whose help has been invaluable. A big thank you to all my fellow
    councillors for the help they have given me and thank you, Cllr Bride, for stepping into
    my shoes at late notice on more than one occasion. I have been pleased to attend the
    change of USAF commander at RAF Fairford and Beating the Retreat at the 29th Regiment last
    summer. Also I was proud to lay the wreath on behalf of the Parish Council and the
    community on Remembrance Sunday. In addition to being Chairperson of the Parish Council I
    am also Chairperson of the Finance Committee and am pleased to report that the current
    financial position of the PC is in good condition. I would like to say thank you to our
    two Ward Councillors, Cllr Mrs Anne Clark and Cllr Dr Leslie Jones, and to Cllr Shaun
    Parsons from Gloucestershire County Council who unfortunately could not be here tonight.
    They have all in turn helped enormously throughout the year. Planning We have considered
    61 planning applications of which 57 were granted by the CDC and only 4 refused. The first
    stage of the development of the old CAMAS site is well under way and is to be known as the
    Limes. The Parish Council accepted an offer from Westbury Homes, the developers, of
    £13,000 for ground maintenance on this first stage, improvement of the play areas in lieu
    of play equipment and the reasonable legal costs associated with the agreement. A Section
    106 Agreement has now been signed by both parties and the Parish Council will receive the
    money in due course. We have met with Westbury Homes to talk through future Phases which
    will eventually be drawn up as plans. An appeal was made by Watermark Club, Spring Lake,
    Station Road to the Planning Inspectorate against the refusal of CDC to grant an
    application for full planning permission for the construction of a new car park for club
    members to separate existing parking from lodge owners. This appeal was dismissed. Finance
    The precept has been set this year at £31,540. This represents an increase of
    approximately 3%. Our main achievements this year have been (i) the settlement achieved
    with WDS (Wiltshire Direct Services) on a long standing dispute with the quality of play
    equipment supplied and its installation and (ii) the purchase of Robert Franklin Way
    playing field from Gloucestershire County Council. On 28th April Cllr Nicholas held a
    meeting in the Village Hall for interested parties to discuss the selection of possible
    play equipment and the input was very encouraging, especially from the youth who attended.<br>
    <strong>Village Maintenance</strong><br>
    A license has been drawn up, to replace the lease, for the Cricket Club and is in the
    final stages of completion. In the meantime the Parish Council gave the Cricket Club
    permission to place a temporary shed to act as a pavilion on the field during the coming
    season. When the legal formalities have been completed work should start on the new
    pavilion. Cllr Stuart and Cllr Gardiner met with Mr Barry Greenaway and toured the village
    with him to discuss improvements to the street lighting. The lights in Station road needed
    to be realigned to light the path instead of illuminating the ditch, pretty as it may be.
    In other places over hanging branches were obscuring the lamps' effect. Mr Greenaway
    promised that he will send a report and his recommendations to the Parish Council. A
    meeting was held with CDC officers Kim Cooper, Nick Love and Carl Jones to discuss the
    Market Town Initiative scheme and ideas were considered on how South Cerney could benefit
    from the scheme. An open meeting has been arranged for Tuesday 29th May to discuss ways
    ahead for South Cerney especially village safety and traffic calming. Everyone is welcome.
    Watch out for the notices on the board and Cerney News. Mr Wrightson of Kingfisher Place
    has been very kindly cleaning out the ditch on a purely voluntary basis. The Parish
    Council are extremely grateful to him and a letter has been sent to him thanking him for
    his efforts. Cllr Bride and myself attended a meeting with Mr Elcocks, Cllr Parsons from
    GCC and Mr Radford from Road Safety Management regarding, what we consider, the very
    unsafe alterations to Preston Tollbar. We met on site on a very cold wet day and soon
    realised that only minor alterations could be made. We fail to understand why a roundabout
    was not considered at the site or traffic lights at least. The Jubilee Gardens saga
    rumbles on. On March 23 this year an informal hearing was held in the Wesley Rooms to
    determine the application made by Cllr Nicholas on behalf of the Parish Council to
    register the open land there as a Village Green. The appeal was very well attended by
    villagers and lasted from 10am to about 6.30pm. Well done, Philip. You did us proud. As
    yet there has been no decision and hopefully we will be successful in stopping further
    development there and let the open space remain for the benefit of all residents in the
    village.<br>
    <strong>Village Floods</strong><br>
    From meetings I have attended with representatives from Thames Water, Environment Agency,
    Fosseway Housing and various departments of the CDC, I perceived that all the
    professionals were and have been quite proactive regarding the very serious problem of the
    flooding in South Cerney although to start with, it was not thought to be so. We as a
    Council are trying to keep in contact with all parties. The CDC is keeping a finger on the
    very complicated issues and serious problems regarding the flooding especially in Berkeley
    Close. Our two Ward Councillors have been very active and have put in a lot of time trying
    to resolve the problem and I would like to say a special thank you to Cllrs Mrs Clark and
    Dr Jones for this. Meetings have and are still taking place to discuss the plans for the
    Upper Up Millennium Park which is sometimes referred to as the Cerney Ups and Downs. We
    are getting there ... so watch out for future announcements. Thank you all for coming. I
    would like to remind you that most of us Councillors hold down full time jobs and
    sometimes at 10.30pm find it very difficult to discuss issues, sometimes we have 58 items
    of correspondence and my ambition to close the meetings at 9.30pm fail at most meetings.<br>
    <strong>QUESTIONS</strong><br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Thomas of 1 Jubilee Gardens enquired why on the left hand side the
    grass entrance to Jubilee Gardens was only half mown. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) was not aware
    of any problem but would enquire from Fosseway.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another resident complained that residents of the Paddock were
    parking on the footpath. Cllr Mrs Gardiner advised that this was a matter for the Police.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Roberts complained about the condition of the footpath from
    Meadow Way to School. The Clerk informed that this was a matter for Gloucestershire County
    Highways to deal with and the matter had already been reported. Mr Ducker suggested that
    the Parish Council carry out the necessary maintenance and ask Gloucestershire County
    Highways to pay.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr E. Curtis reported that the bus shelter was in need of repair.
    Cllr Stuart explained that contractors had already been asked to quote for the repair.<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A member of the public complained about the erosion of the river bank
    and road through School Lane and Bow Wow. Cllr Harris replied that he had spoken to Mr
    Martyn Sommerell from Gloucestershire County Highways who was hoping to effect a repair
    soon.<br>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ducker was holding over a meeting of the Residents Association for
    an update of the sewers and their structures from Mr Nick Brown. A report from Thames
    Water and the Environment Agency&nbsp; on how to solve river flooding in the area had been
    delayed because of the current foot &amp; mouth epidemic.<br>
    7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Thomas asked who would be responsible for grass maintenance if the
    area in Jubilee Gardens was given Village Green status. Cllr Bride replied that as the
    Parish Council doesn't own the land it was not responsible for maintenance. Cllr Jones
    (CDC) would raise the problem with the District Council at his next opportunity.<br>
    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gardening Club wished to plant trees in High Street in the autumn
    and a member wanted to know if there were any restrictions. Cllr Harris advised that the
    Gardening Club should check with the Highways authority on how the realignment of the road
    verge.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>REPORT BY COUNCILLOR MRS ANNE CLARK (CDC)</strong><br>
    During the past year I have served on both the Housing and Resource Committees. For the
    past two years I have been Chairman of a working Party which is responsible for enlarging
    the District Council offices to enable the staff to come on to one site from the various
    offices in the town, and to enlarge the council Chamber and provide more meeting rooms.
    This work will take place during the coming 12 months, and it is hoped that when the work
    is complete, the meeting Rooms and Chamber will not only be used by the Council, but also
    have a wider community use. Cllr Jones and I both serve on the Area South Development
    Control Sub Committee and take an active part in the various planning issues in the Ward.
    Last winter South Cerney suffered from severe flooding in various parts of the village. A
    hotline was set up at the District Council and officers worked round the clock giving help
    with sand bags etc., wherever needed in the District. As a result of the flooding problems
    the District Council undertook to broker a meeting with the various Agencies responsible
    for alleviating the problems i.e. Thames Water, Environment Agency, Fosseway Housing,
    County Council, and for the first time a meeting took place where we stressed the need for
    action. Your Chairman of the Parish Council was also invited to take part in these
    meetings. Last week we met up again and the Environment Agency reported that they will be
    undertaking routine maintenance, including the making up of the river banks above Upper Up
    which will stop water getting onto the road in the Upper Up area, and prevent it from
    entering the system. Fosseway are proceeding with the structural survey of their network
    of sewers and they have promised to make this available when it is complete. We are still
    awaiting the sewer survey by Thames Water, but our next meeting will be in September when
    we hope to have some positive news from them. The new scheme for Political Management of
    the Council is now complete and has been submitted to the Secretary of State. This has
    resulted after wide consultation with the public carried out by Mori and the Council will
    be streamlined into three main Committees, being a Community Committee, Environment and
    Economy and one Development Control Committee dealing with both North and South
    applications. There will also be an Executive Committee with a Leader of Council, and I am
    pleased to report that at last weeks Annual Council Meeting, Cllr Les Jones was appointed
    Leader. The Parish has benefited from some Ward Project money this year. £300 for
    audio/visual equipment for the youth club, £350 South Cerney Toddler group, £350 for
    South Cerney pre-school playgroup, £300 for the Duke of Gloucester Barracks playgroup,
    and £275 for the Mums &amp; Toddlers at the United Church. There is still money in this
    fund if there are any groups in the Village who might like to apply for help. In
    connection with the Foot and Mouth restrictions which have affected not only the farmers
    but also the businesses connected with the tourist industry, I am Chairman of the Non
    Domestic Rating Relief panel and we have been able to help some groups who have been
    especially hit, by giving some rate relief. This is mostly funded by Central Government
    and affects 151 Authorities in the Country and we are one of them. Cllr Jones will now
    give his report, but I would like to thank the Parish Council for all its work during the
    year and the support we receive from them.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>REPORT BY COUNCILLOR DR JONES (CDC)</strong><br>
    I have continued to sit on a wide range of Committees, for example dealing with planning,
    economic development, grants and the Water Park. Planning applications in South Cerney
    have been numerous, with perhaps the most contentious being the Westbury Homes
    application.<br>
    <strong>The Local Plan Review</strong><br>
    The Local Plan review is well underway. For housing the CDC is required to identify sites
    for 1200 homes for the next 10 year period. In line with the County Structure Plan, more
    than half have to be in and around Cirencester. I think it likely that some land will be
    allocated in South Cerney. The draft for consultation should be ready in the autumn.<br>
    <strong>Ward Boundaries</strong><br>
    Ward boundaries have been reviewed through out the District, under 1992 legislation, by
    the Local Government Commission for England. The outcome has been that from May 2003 the
    Ward will include Preston Parish and will be represented by three Councillors. The
    re-arrangement has been based on elector equality, such that, as near as possible, each
    CDC Councillor represents the same number of people.<br>
    <strong>Political Management</strong><br>
    Political Management. Under the Local Government Act 2000, all Local Authorities have been
    required to reorganise their structures and ways of working. Following extensive
    consultations on the options, including a MORI poll, the Council has opted for a
    Ostreamlined committee system with a Leader'. If the Government agrees the proposals, the
    CDC will have three &quot;policy&quot; committees, each of 9 Members. These are the
    Executive Committee (revenue budget, capital programme, personnel, property, grants, Best
    Value, Community Plan, partnership working), the Community Committee (housing,
    environmental health, waste management, leisure, sport and recreation) and the Environment
    &amp; Economy Committee (planning policy, local economy, market towns, conservation,
    countryside, Water Park, tourism, car parks). In addition, there will be a Development
    Control Committee of 18 to determine planning applications. The Chairman of the Executive
    Committee is the Leader of the Council and I have been elected to this post. The new
    arrangements should come into effect on 1 September.<br>
    <strong>Best Value Reviews</strong><br>
    Best Value reviews. This is another central Government initiative, aimed at year on year
    improvement in the delivery of services, all of which have to be reviewed over a 5 year
    cycle. These include external inspections from the Audit Commission. Development Control
    has been reviewed. We are below the required rate for the determination of planning
    applications in the target period of 8 weeks. The Development Control Committee will meet
    every three weeks. Town and Parish Councils will be asked to respond to consultations in 3
    weeks rather than four as at present.<br>
    <strong>The Community Plan</strong><br>
    The Community Plan will be the overarching strategic document of the Council. It has
    priorities for action - identified via consultations, polls, focus groups - some of which
    can only be dealt with by working in partnership with outside bodies. The CDC will be
    forming the Cotswold Forum (the statutorily required &quot;local strategic
    partnership&quot;) to help deliver the priorities of the Plan.<br>
    <strong>Grants</strong><br>
    Grants. The Ward Projects and Community Grants scheme continue to be available. South
    Cerney has benefited over recent years, with about £5900 in Ward grants and £24000 for
    the cricket club pavilion. This money has come from the interest earned on the investment
    of the capital sum from the transfer of the housing stock three years ago.<br>
    <strong>Market Towns Initiative</strong><br>
    Market Towns Initiative. This scheme, backed by a fund, enables communities in our larger
    settlements to develop schemes for environmental improvements. An initial meeting between
    the Parish Council, Ward Members and CDC Officers, has been held and an open meeting is
    arranged for 29 May.<br>
    <strong>Council Tax</strong><br>
    Council Tax. The Bill is made up of three elements: County Council (79%), Police (9.5%)
    and CDC (11.4%). For Band D the CDC Tax is £98, roughly £2 per week. This is an increase
    of £6 per year compared with last year, or about 6.5%. The CDC revenue budget is
    underpinned by Government grant (£5.0m), fees and charges (£4.8m), investment income
    (£1.8m) and the Council Tax (£3.3m). Decreases in the first three income streams could
    lead to an increase in Council Tax to maintain the same levels of service delivery.<br>
    <strong>Flooding</strong><br>
    Flooding. This was dealt with by Mrs Gardiner and Mrs Clark. We will continue to push for
    solutions to the various aspects of flooding.<br>
    <br>
    I would like to thank the Parish Council for its continued support during the year.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>QUESTIONS</strong><br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Bride stated that the change in Ward Boundaries to include
    Preston although not yet determined had been strongly objected to by the Parish Council.
    Cllr Jones (CDC) replied that almost certainly Preston will be included with South Cerney
    and Somerford in the new ward and three District Councillors would be allocated.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ducker asked if the new arrangement for the wards would be
    &quot;warded&quot;. Cllr Jones (CDC) replied: &quot;Not necessarily.&quot;<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Bride referred to the Local Plan and the new development
    boundary as the Parish Council had expressed concern that the flooding and sewerage
    problems be sorted out. Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported that she had raised this at a recent
    meeting dealing with the flooding problem and Mr A. R. Jones, Head of Planning at CDC
    would be more robust in his comments in future.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr R. Edgar advised that complaints were registered at Thames Water
    and the Environment Agency on a points basis although each complaint was recorded
    individually. He explained that a complaint from an individual was treated with the same
    weight as one from the Parish Council so therefore the more complaints made by residents
    the more points were given to moving the problem up the agenda.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>REPORT FROM CLLR S. PARSONS (GCC)</strong><br>
    Cllr Parsons (GCC) apologised by letter to the Chairperson and all those present for his
    non-attendance at the Annual Parish Meeting because of a long-delayed business trip and he
    would be happy to give a report to the next meeting of the Parish Council. &quot;I am
    obviously pleased that at long last the sale of the Robert Franklin Way play area to the
    Parish has taken place, after a long drawn out saga. I remain, however, unhappy about the
    road improvements at Preston Toll Bar. While road improvements were necessary, the actual
    outcome seems deeply flawed. While I am able to achieve some minor improvements any
    significant change to the current layout will take time. Please would you let me know of
    any accidents and incidences at the crossroads, however minor, so I can bring pressure to
    bear. I also hope that in the near future we can update the traffic plan for South Cerney,
    especially now that Derek Howell¹s replacement (John Whittaker) is in post. Following the
    floods and other emergencies which happened in the year the County Council has reported to
    the Home Office that emergency relief programmes are totally inadequate. In particular it
    would seem that the Agencies, such as the Environment Agency, are unable to act quickly in
    these circumstances, and do not always know what to do. For example inspectors went on
    site at Sandhurst following the chemical explosion there without wearing protective gear
    and had to be warned by the Gloucestershire Fire Brigade of the dangers of radio active
    waste and then taken off site. The South Cerney floods are another example contained in
    the report to the Home Office. I am pleased to note that the Home Office has agreed to
    review and hopefully to change procedures in due course. I will speak more fully at a
    further meeting of the Parish Council about the County Council¹s finances, since they are
    complicated. Suffice it to say that over the last few years under the effective Lib/Labour
    pace Council taxes have risen by some 40% and about £5 million has been taken from
    Capital to support Revenue. I suppose rather like taking out a mortgage to pay the flood
    bills. Interest on Council debt is now some £4 million over Government guidelines at
    about £18 million, monies which are wasted to Gloucestershire. Again my apologies for not
    being there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>REPORT BY THE VICAR REV. J. CALVERT</strong><br>
    The Vicar, Rev John Calvert gave a brief synopsis of the activities of the Church.
    Millennium services had been a great success with very large numbers attending both
    midnight services and one at noon on January 1st. The plaque commemorating the visit by
    the Princess Royal had been dedicated. A group of church members had visited the Holy Land
    in March and there was a successful exhibition of Christmas Cribs over the Spring Bank
    Holiday. We hoped to complete the building of new toilet facilities during the year. The
    Vicar emphasised the work of the church as being to support the local community as best it
    possibly can.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>REPORT ON ANN EDWARDS SCHOOL BY ROGER EDGAR,<br>
    CHAIRMAN OF SCHOOL GOVERNORS</strong><br>
    <strong>Personnel</strong><br>
    This year has seen a number of personnel changes in both Governors and teaching staff. We
    have unfortunately lost Ray Nicholas who is on long-term sickness and Carol Bassett has
    taken his place and Mrs MacFarlane who is now on maternity leave. On the governors side
    Graham Lodge has changed from being a parent governor to being a LEA governor and Nick
    Pascoe resigned on moving away . Their replacanents after an election contest are Brian
    Clifford and Rachael Dunn. Mrs Clare Baker on finishing her term of office decided not to
    continue and Mrs Sarah Harvey was elected in her place. We have also persuaded Lt Col.
    Mike Hickson to join us as co-opted governor. Currently we have 260 pupils on roll which
    is about the same as this time last year . The expected increase last summer did not
    materialise and the housing development in South Cerney has only just got underway. Since
    September we have had 25 new arrivals (excluding Reception pupils) and 17 departures. This
    gives a pupil mobility of 16% with 4 months of the school year left. So far it looks as if
    there will be 35 new entrants in Reception in September.<br>
    <strong>Governors' Activities</strong><br>
    Governors' meetings and committees have been well attended and there have been some lively
    discussions. Governors have attended In Service Training days on School Improvement
    planning, Performance Management and the School Development Plan as well as being involved
    with the staff in policy review working groups. Governors have paid regular planned visits
    to the school and have also attended the annual review with the assigned inspector. A
    number of training courses both during the day and in the evening have been attended so
    that the Governors can keep up to date with current legislation and practice.<br>
    <strong>Curriculum and SATS</strong><br>
    Our ICT suite with 16 computers has been fully utilised and classes have had timetabled
    sessions each week. The school Web site annedwards.gloucs.sch.uk is growing in content by
    the week. It is linked to the South Cerney virtual tour site and others. There is an after
    school computer club and there have been sessions run in conjunction with Cirencester
    College for adults in the evenings. Other after school activities include gym, netball,
    football, dance, gardening and the Bug Club for those interested in nature and the
    environment. Thanks must go to the staff for giving their time and energy in organising
    these activities. Our results in the Key Stage 2 SATS tests were in line with our
    expectations and writing had improved following the implementation of the improvement
    plan. It is hoped that this can be sustained and built upon.<br>
    <strong>Footsteps ­ Educating towards a more sustainable future</strong><br>
    We have continued our link with the Joel Omino school in Kisumo and the children regularly
    contact through pen letters. We also send educational materials with the assistance of the
    29th Regt RLC.<br>
    <strong>D.A.R.E. Project</strong><br>
    P.C. John Smith of the MOD police 29th Regt RLC has again run the drug awareness programme
    for Year 6 pupils called DARE, Drug Abuse Resistance Education. He has the confidence of
    all the children and has despite having been ill himself completed the course and
    organised the presentation ceremony at the beginning of April.<br>
    <strong>Other Activities</strong><br>
    Children have been to the Widerness Centre for a residential visit. Y6 children have
    entered the Dowty Technology Awards and two will enter the finals in May. The school have
    had visits from The Life Education with sessions for pupils, parents and teachers, also
    from the Kinetic Theatre Group, the Daylight Theatre, the Road Safety Unit and Nick
    Williams the Bird Wise man. Pupils have taken part in the Cirencester inter-schools
    swimming gala, 6-a-side football tournaments. Parents have started to attend class
    assemblies. The aim is for each class to invite parents to at least one class assembly per
    year. Parents have been pleased to be invited to join in with class-led collective
    worship, which must be viewed as a regular part of school life.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>REMARKS</strong><br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr R. Edgar informed the meeting that everyone was welcome to visit
    the school and one did not need to be a parent of a pupil to do so. All would be made
    welcome.<br>

    <strong>REPORT FROM MIKE STUART,<br>
    CHAIRMAN OF THE VILLAGE HALL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</strong><br>
    <br>
    The past twelve months have been a period of consolidation. We have at last been able to
    reach agreement with all parties concerned regarding the provision of access suitable for
    users of our Hall who have disabilities. Last November we had a very constructive meeting
    with several Disabled Users. Both sides were able to either express their needs or to
    explain why certain improvements could not be carried out as the works would not comply
    with various rules etc. As a result of that meeting, we were able to reach agreement as to
    an access that would satisfy all parties; namely that we will provide a smooth surfaced
    pathway to the side of the Hall connecting the public road to the side access door which
    had already been upgraded to form a suitable access for disabled users. Prior to that
    meeting, we had also reached agreement with Mrs Enid Godwin over the ownership of the
    strip of land forming the track leading to the side of the Hall to her yard. It was agreed
    that we actually own the land with Mrs Godwin having a Right of Way over it in perpetuity.
    These discussions were carried out in a very amicable atmosphere. Following these
    negotiations, our architect, Mr Clive Froggatt amended the plans for the Disabled Access
    and for the improvements to the toilet facilities including toilets for the Disabled. He
    has now obtained Building regulation approval and Planning approval, subject only to the
    planners needing to have sight of detailed specifications of the two wall lights we intend
    to fix on the end wall to illuminate the new pathway. He is now in the process of going to
    at least three firms of builders to obtain competitive tenders. The Kitchen improvements
    have not been started yet but are planned for the first or second weekend in June. Funding
    will be the next major obstacle but we have recently met Mr Rodney Vaughan of the GRCC who
    has offered to assist us in our applications etc. Nothing can be done until we have the
    prices back from the builders. As the Cerney Players were unsuccessful in their attempts
    to raise the money for the demountable stage, we intend to include that scheme in our own
    funding applications. During the past year the Village has lost the use of the old school
    play ground as a parking space. This was unfortunate but not unexpected. There was no way
    that the Parish could have afforded to purchase the site especially as the old buildings
    were not suitable for conversion to a community centre. The loss of the parking has been a
    problem but has not been helped by people who are quite able to walk to the Hall insisting
    on using their cars. Hopefully this trend will be reversed over a period and the problem
    will ease. Lettings were much improved on the previous year. An extra £467 was taken.
    This was due mainly to the excellent bookings by the Cirencester College for their
    Computer courses. Also the fact that the Scout Hut has been out of commission has resulted
    in more use of the hall. In fact, our finances are not too bad at all. Thanks must be
    given to the Parish Council for the top class support given to the Hall committee. An
    extremely sad thing happened in the New Year when our good friend Harold Cook passed away.
    Harold had been a great chap helping his wife Dianne, our Hall's manager. They were a
    great team and it didn¹t surprise me when Dianne decided to hand in her notice so that
    she can spend more time with her daughters and her grandchildren. We will miss her
    dreadfully when she goes at the end of this month. Dianne has said that she will help her
    replacement to settle in and I am sure that the change over will go as smoothly as
    possible. The coming year will be an interesting one. Whether or not we will have all the
    improvements done by next year we can only wait and see. It will all depend on funding.
    Finally, I wish to thank all the people who make up the Hall committee. Their input and
    hard work should be greatly appreciated by this community.<br>
