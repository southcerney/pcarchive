 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened proceedings at 7.30pm and wished everyone a happy new
year. He explained that as the Committee meetings scheduled for the previous Monday
evening had to be cancelled because of the adverse weather conditions the format of this
Parish Council meeting would be slightly altered to account for that fact. He asked for all
Parish Councillors to support the revised procedure.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>APOLOGY</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land had sent an apology for her absence as the road conditions were 
 so icy. Cllr Bennett (CDC) had sent an apology as he was attending a previously 
 postponed meeting, Cllr Jenkins (CDC) apologised as he was at Preston Parish 
 Council meeting and Cllr Messenger had apologised for his absence as road 
 conditions prevented his attendance.</p>

 9th DECEMBER 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2621 – <b>MATTERS ARISING</b> 1st paragraph 3rd line: 
 delete 4pm insert 6pm <br>
 Page 2622 – <b>Graffiti</b> 2nd paragraph 1st line: after incidents insert “of 
 graffiti” <br>
 Page 2622 – <b>Bus Shelter, Station Road</b> last line: add “Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 informed the Parish Council that a timetable had been inserted into the holder 
 of the bus shelter in Station Road; Cllr Nicholas likewise reported that the 
 timetable and holder in the Limes bus shelter were now in order.” <br>
 Page 2622 – <b>Bow Wow hedge</b> last line now to read: “back the hedge, on the 
 south side of Bow Wow lane, opposite Lady Fanshawe’s property.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. Members of the 
 Parish Council were all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Jasmin Tresadern informed the Parish Council that the 
 Youth Parish Council (YPC) had last met on 5th January. The main item discussed 
 was the provision of Christmas lights in the village. Jasmin wanted to know how 
 much money would be available for the scheme and Cllr Stuart explained to her 
 that first it would be necessary for the YPC to get quotations from suppliers, 
 then to find out how the power supply to the lights could be provided and then 
 implications of health and safety considerations. He told Jasmin that Cllr Mrs 
 Land was awaiting contact with any member of the YPC regarding the funding of 
 schemes and Jasmin will inform the group of this request. Cllr Kimberley 
 indicated that he may have access to a supply of lights and asked the YPC to 
 contact him for further discussions. Cllr Stuart thanked Jasmin for attending 
 the meeting, especially as the snow and ice covering the roads and footpaths 
 made walking very hazardous.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 4th January the Clerk took part, by conference 
 phone, in a meeting with members of the Precept Committee where the budget for 
 April 2010–March 2011 was discussed. The recommendations from that Committee 
 will be put to this meeting later for consideration and approval. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During December of the 13 available working days the Clerk 
 reported that he had averaged 4 hours 12 minutes per day which roughly averages 
 3 hours per week in excess of his contract. Over the period the Clerk had taken 
 some of his annual leave entitlement but explained that the management of the 
 Council does not stop during his absence and the workload remains regardless of 
 his time away. Nevertheless, he stated that the arrangement was acceptable.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND 
 VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE AND MATTERS RELATING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Graffiti </b><br>
 In response to a query Cllr Caunce was informed that there was nothing of note 
 to be seen of the graffiti after a recent road sweeping exercise.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Rights of Way <br>
 </b>Cllr Caunce asked Cllr Stuart for an update on his meetings with Mike 
 Barton, Gloucestershire County Council PROWofficer. Cllr Stuart reported that 
 due to the effects of the extreme winter weather, that the whole area and 
 especially around Wildmoorway Lane, was experiencing it is very unlikely that 
 there will be any work carried out on the proposed boardwalk or the rest of the 
 lane until after April at the earliest. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart will attend a meeting of the 
 Eastern Canal Partnership on 21st January. Cllr Stuart has arranged an 
 invitation for Mike Barton who has confirmed that he will there. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart updated Parish Councillors on his meeting with Hartell Construction 
 on how best to refurbish the surface of the Upper Up car park and also how to 
 prevent heavy goods vehicles from using it as a turning area and consequently 
 churning up the gravel surface. Mr Hartell suggested that a fence is built on 
 an east/west line, approximately half way across the car park, coming short of 
 the entrance to enable the recycling activity. The structure would divide the 
 car park and prevent lorries turning. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris left the room as he had given a quotation for 
 the following work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Two quotations had been received for the refurbishment of 
 the car park by disturbing the gravel and re-compacting it. The Parish Council 
 discussed the merits of the differing schemes. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce 
 and seconded by Cllr Kimberley that the Parish Council accepts the lower 
 quotation from James Harris Contracting. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris rejoined the discussion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council were minded to go ahead with installing 
 a fence to divide the car park thereby protecting the surface from abusive use. 
 Councillor Caunce, Councillor Harris and Cllr Stuart agreed to hold a site 
 meeting to finalise the fence line and its design. Cllr Stuart volunteered to 
 arrange for quotations to provide such a fence to prevent lorries from using 
 the car park as a turning area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Keystoke Hedge<br>
 </b>&nbsp;Cllr Nicholas reported that the hedge was still obscuring the public 
 light and the excessive growth should be removed. Cllr Stuart volunteered to 
 contact the owners. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Bus Shelter</b> <br>
 The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Jay who suggested that no further action, 
 as this time, should be taken to replace the defaced perspex panel in the bus 
 shelter in Station Road. Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that originally the suppliers 
 of the shelter had informed her that a replacement panel would cost about £75 
 but a recent quotation had stated the work would be £205. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to Cherry Tree</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had not been able to locate the address of the person alleged to be 
 responsible for damaging the tree. The Clerk will write to Miss Rebecca Lodge 
 requesting information on the whereabouts of the person.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reported on the condition of the play area at Robert 
 Franklin Way. She repeated that there were still no wheels on the train and the 
 graffiti remained. Cllr Harris stated that the wheels would be replaced when he 
 had time. Mention was made that the equipment in the toddlers area looked 
 “tired” and needed cleaning. Jasmin Tresadern volunteered to speak to the Youth 
 Parish Council to see if it might consider washing it down. Cllr Nicholas 
 volunteered to paint the large climbing frame. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported on the Upper Up play area but stated that since the start 
 of the snow fall inspections have been impossible and not necessary as no one 
 had used any of the equipment. The car park, he insisted, must be levelled as 
 soon as possible as it was becoming dangerous to pedestrians. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce stated that the play area was now snow covered but otherwise the 
 equipment was in proper order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow Scheme</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris left the room as he had given a quotation for the following work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Five quotations had been received for the works specified 
 in Bow Wow. After all quotations were examined it was proposed by Cllr Caunce 
 and seconded by Cllr Mrs Tunbridge that the Parish Council accepts the lowest 
 quotation from Philip Dickenson. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris rejoined the discussion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gypsy Lane</b> <br>
 Cllr Kimberley reported that Gypsy Lane was now passable after its recent 
 flooding. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damaged Willow tree, upstream of bridge over river 
 Churn</b> <br>
 Ali Swainston emailed that had inspected the tree and will arrange for a 
 specialist contractor to give a further opinion. He expected to coppice the 
 tree in the near future and would keep the Parish Council informed as to his 
 timetable. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BSC12</b> <br>
 In response to Cllr Nicholas’ report that BSC12 was in need of repair, Cllr 
 Stuart stated that Mike Barton had informed that the path would be 
 investigated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to public seat at Preaching Cross</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas will meet with Matthew King to resolve the damage accidentally 
 caused to the public seat sited by the Preaching Cross. The Clerk will forward 
 seating information to Cllr Nicholas. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ALLOTMENTS AT UPPER UP </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart outlined his proposals for the setting up of 
 an allotment group. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following the abortive attempt to persuade the Gloucester 
 Diocese to reopen Hill Orchard allotments it was suggested that the Parish 
 Council should consider using the section of spare/unused land behind the 
 tennis courts at Upper Up for the purpose. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Since our December meeting, when it was unanimously agreed 
 that we should be of a mind to consider this proposal, we have visited and 
 measured the area of land more precisely. With the details obtained a plan of 
 the site has been drawn with suggested plots sketched in. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following publicity in the local press and in the Cerney 
 News, a number of would-be allotment holders have been in contact with now more 
 than 20 people indicating that they would want a plot. One man said that he has 
 been waiting on Bruton Knowles’ list for more than four years. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Information from many of these people suggests that they 
 do not want a full size allotment as a 350 sq metre plot would be far too much 
 to cope with. Most say they want something about the size of the small plots at 
 the Church Lane allotments: approx a “quarter size” of some 75-80 sq metres 
 (approx 13m x 6m plus pathways). If we set that as an average plot at Upper Up 
 we could have some 21 plots, of which two would be a little smaller as the site 
 is not a true rectangle. There could be some spare space along the hedge 
 against Mr Slator’s pony paddock where sheds could be positioned.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The site would need to be fenced to prevent vandalism and 
 theft of produce but as virtually three sides already have either hedges or 
 fences the expenditure will not be too great. One national specialist fencing 
 company has said that to have a post and chain link fence of 2.4 metres high 
 would cost in the region of £40-50 per metre length plus extra for gates. As 
 there will be some 65 metres of fencing plus gates, that firm would need approx 
 £3.5k to do the job. That type of fence could be too substantial for the 
 purpose and we will naturally get other ideas and estimates from local firms. 
 However, it is unlikely that we would spend much less than £3K on enclosing the 
 site. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Water supply is another requirement and this could be done 
 by either connecting to the Thames Water main near to the cricket pavilion or 
 have a pumping system from the river to a series of tanks. The second will be 
 more labour intensive to keep going but much more economical and easier to 
 control with no regular utility bills to pay. This is something for the actual 
 garden users to settle on.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">From our point of view, the main ongoing problem with such 
 a scheme would be the routine management of the site. It is a time consuming 
 and thankless task having to invoice individual allotment holders with annual 
 rent bills and to cope with a steady flow of enquiries from would be gardeners. 
 It is strongly recommended that we do not undertake to actually carry out such 
 management but rather set up the initial set of “tenants” as a self managing 
 group. The group would need to be agreeable to taking on the site and to 
 dealing with all aspects of the lettings and routine management/rent 
 collection, paying Parish Council an annual sum as rent. It is likely that the 
 people we are having enquiries from are of a type that would be open to such a 
 commitment and would be able to get it to work. Naturally, assistance would be 
 available from several experienced sources to see the group through the initial 
 stages but Parish Council would need to carry out regular inspections to ensure 
 that the site was being run in a satisfactory manner. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Rent levels are open to debate but few allotments in the 
 country are much below £25 pa for a “quarter plot”. However, most council 
 landlords do give substantial discounts to pensioners and those on benefits. It 
 seems that the existing allotment holders in our village pay a minimum £10 per 
 annum for a plot whether it be for a half or quarter plot. Full plots are 
 currently £20 pa. Incidentally, it is understood that full plots coming 
 available on the church’s existing sites will in future be let as two 
 individual half plots to ease the waiting list. If we were to base our 
 projected income from this scheme based on £400 pa we would be setting 
 individual plot rents at £20 pa which is not an extortionate figure. To achieve 
 £500 pa an extra £5 per plot would need to be charged. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Sheds would be an essential requirement but would need to 
 be controlled quite firmly. The type of design and materials used must be to a 
 pre-set standard. Some councils insist on sheds having to be of one size and 
 design purchased from one specific maker. Again this is something to debate and 
 to get the allotment holders group involved in. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">We should use our efforts to ensure that the allotment 
 holders do work with the Composting Club right from the start and to this end 
 it is recommended that we purchase a container or store such as already used by 
 the cricket and football clubs. This should be positioned near to the 
 composting site and will house the new shredder/chipper and the community 
 rotavator (which naturally will be a vital part of any allotment scheme) plus 
 whatever items Parish Council need to keep safe and dry (such as the sand for 
 the Fenplay surfaces). Approximate cost for such a store is £1k but we may get 
 assistance from grants etc. It is worth remembering that a few months ago we 
 committed £690 to purchase the shredder but will fully recoup that sum through 
 a grant from GCC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It is suggested that to confirm the actual level of demand 
 for allotments, everyone expressing interest should be invited to a meeting 
 where they can be informed what is possible and what they would be committing 
 themselves to taking on, not only as allotment holders/gardeners but also as 
 members of a self governing group. Such a meeting should be held before this 
 Parish Council takes any definite steps towards obtaining planning approval or 
 spends any money on the scheme other than possibly purchasing a container for 
 the composting site. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">This community does require more allotments and as we do 
 have the means of satisfying that need, we should seriously consider taking on 
 this project. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council was in full agreement that Cllr Stuart 
 should arrange to hold a meeting of interested participants in the Village Hall 
 as soon as it could be arranged. Cllr Stuart will report to the Parish Council 
 at its next meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND 
 MATTERS RELATING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spreadsheet</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay started his report by commenting that the spreadsheet was very 
 informative overall, highlighting the shortfall in the budget spend for Village 
 Maintenance which could now be applied to extra jobs identified in the 
 community. A peculiarity which should be understood was that the spreadsheet is 
 a calculation of expenditure and did not account for income. For example, in 
 the case of the insurance expense there was nothing to show that the football 
 and cricket clubs had made a contribution. That is for the balance sheet to 
 make clear.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence</b> <br>
 John Hunt had requested a donation to subsidise toilet arrangements for the 
 Street Fair. The Parish Council agreed that it was minded to make a donation of 
 £250 at the appropriate time, when other donations were decided at the Parish 
 Council meeting in March. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that investment income for the Cutts 
 Charity had dramatically reduced although it had been offset by the exceptional 
 generosity of individuals and groups in the village enabling some very special 
 contributions to be made. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Communication Proposal <br>
 </b>Cllr Jay proposed that following the recent exercise when the Clerk had 
 emailed Parish Council business to Parish Councillors because he had been 
 unable to travel due to the treacherous snowy condition of the minor roads the 
 scheme should be considered. Parish Councillors who did not have printing 
 equipment could “buddy” another Councillor. This would reduce the cost of 
 photocopying, travel and also the Clerk’s time in distribution. Parish 
 Councillors not in receipt of their allowance could claim for the cost of an 
 ink cartridge and the Clerk would supply a ream of paper for copying purposes. 
 It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Kimberley that this new 
 arrangement should be tried for a trial period of six months. The Parish 
 Council was in full agreement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PRECEPT PROPOSALS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Precept Committee had agreed a budget and recommended 
 its acceptance to the Parish Council. The figures were broadly in line with 
 those of the previous year and because of a technical adjustment to the 
 calculation of the local tax base there would be an insignificant increase of 
 5p per annum on a band “D” property. Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Caunce seconded 
 a motion that the Parish Council agrees to the budget deliberations. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. The Clerk will inform CDC accordingly.</p>

 Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney GL7 5TL <br>
 Proposal: Creation of a temporary construction access to development approved 
 under permission 09/01069/FUL at Spring Lakes, Station Road, South Cerney GL7 
 5TH (R) Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart had proposed that the Committee 
 recommends to the Parish Council to accept its recommendation not to object to 
 this temporary construction access, provided that as a condition the applicant 
 is required to install a footpath along the western side Station Road, from the 
 entrance to South Cerney Sailing Club/The Landings down as far as a point 
 opposite the Station Road ‘Lakeside’ car park. This will fill in the ‘missing 
 link’ to connect the bridleway – Sustrans Route 45 – to the footpath that runs 
 south from the Lakeside car park. <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chapman had objected to this temporary access because it is on a bend 
 which is not shown on the plans, and the access would not be easily seen when 
 approached from South Cerney village.<br>
 Four responses had been received by email of which 3 had no objection and 1 
 objection. The response therefore made to CDC was no objection. <br>
 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Jay 
 that the Parish Council agrees not to object to 09/04226/FUL and 09/04227/LBC 
 and ratifies the decision on 09/04250/FUL of the Committee. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.4498/WFour Pillars Hotel Condition 24 </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After investigation Ian Coggon (GCC) is of the opinion 
 that to provide a cycleway along the Spine Road frontage to the hotel site 
 would have little advantage as this cycleway would not lead on to any other 
 facilities at either end. There are no proposals or policy to have a cycleway 
 down both sides of the Spine Road and currently a cycleway does exist all the 
 way along one side (opposite the hotel). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In the event that a cycleway was provided under Condition 
 24 then it would involve both pedestrians and cyclists attempting to cross the 
 road to get to the cycleway on the other side which would be potentially 
 hazardous. Cyclists could of course just ride down the road but the provision 
 of the cycleway is then nonsensical. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Site investigation shows that the hotel site is connected 
 by an internal route into the Cotswold Water Park Gateway Centre. This Centre 
 is then connected to the canal side cycle route which gives access under the 
 bridge to the far side of the road and connection to the Spine Road cycleway. 
 This would be the preferred leisure route to be used by cyclists. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mike Napper (CDC) has already said that if a situation is 
 accepted whereby the cycleway as per Condition 24 was not needed then the hotel 
 would need to apply for a variation in condition. To agree to such a variation 
 we would want to ensure that the internal route was secured by condition (if 
 such a condition was in fact reasonable, as it would involve the land owned by 
 the Cotswold Water Park Gateway Centre). We would also prefer that some signing 
 was erected as this would direct people in the right direction. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart was to enquire from Mike Barton if it was 
 possible to create a footpath on the eastern side of the carriageway to connect 
 the grounds of the Four Pillars hotel to the adjacent river Churn.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas asked that Parish Councillors should forward 
 questions or thoughts to him for discussion on the agenda of next month’s 
 Parish Council meeting on the current or future management of Cotswold Water 
 Park. Questions to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP who will be chairing a meeting on 
 Friday 5th March to discuss developments at the Cotswold Water Park could then 
 be formulated.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce noted that large rectangular planter boxes 
 sturdily built from old railway line sleepers had been positioned by a team 
 from Wiltshire County Council, in order to restrict vehicles parking on the 
 bridge and its approaches, on the lane leaving the village in a north easterly 
 direction. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley asked the Clerk to enquire from the 
 Enforcement Officer at CDC if an application for the very large advertising 
 sign on the eastern side of the Spine Road, by the closed off entrance to the 
 Four Pillars hotel had been made. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris presented the Clerk with three cheques 
 totalling £580 he had received for memorial trees.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart explained that Chris Graham our agent dealing 
 with the refurbishment of the footpath from the Upper Up car park westwards for 
 175 metres approximately was unable to proceed until Thames Water’s agent 
 Bruton Knowles had decided whether or not to accept the quotation for the work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart noted that the Village Plan had been 
 operational for 5 years. He had spoken to Chris Coucher at GRCC who was in 
 favour of refreshing and reviewing the plan and was interested in using South 
 Cerney as a template for other areas. Cllr Stuart will inform Mr Coucher that 
 the Parish Council is in agreement that a meeting is held in order to 
 investigate how best to progress the plan.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons stated that salt production in the United 
 Kingdom amounted to some 30,000 tonnes per week whereas there were currently 
 orders for 300,000 tonnes outstanding. As Cerney Wick was served by three 
 separate school buses Gloucestershire Highways should upgrade its access to a 
 secondary route for salting. Unfortunately any change to its status would not 
 come into force this season. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 10.12pm.</p>
