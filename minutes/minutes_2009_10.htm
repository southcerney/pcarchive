 <p class="MsoNormal">Two members of the public were present. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman , Cllr Stuart opened proceedings at 7.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 9th SEPTEMBER 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Kimberley and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Members of the Parish 
 Council were all in favour. Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart abstained as they had not 
 attended the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Jasmin Tresardern and potential new member Chris Wearing 
 represented the Youth Parish Council. Jasmin had the difficult task of 
 explaining that Sinead Peare had left the group through pressure of studies. 
 Cllr Jay remarked that the modern demands placed on students at ‘A’ level was 
 enormous although there were also advantages to be gained for example with 
 recognition through the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme. Members of the Parish 
 Council agreed with Cllr Kimberley and Cllr Stuart who stated that the Parish 
 Council would totally support the reformed group. Cllr Stuart added that it was 
 a golden opportunity for Jasmin to work with Mary Mychaleckyj from Young 
 Gloucestershire. Cllr Mrs Land will liaise with Jasmin on play equipment later 
 in the month. Cllr Stuart agreed with Cllr Caunce who said that past members of 
 the group had done a fantastic job. Cllr Stuart finished by saying that he was 
 proud of Jasmin and praised her for the courage shown in coming to this meeting 
 with the ownerous task of explaining the circumstances in which the group had 
 found itself and hoped that in the near future she would be returning to report 
 on the new arrangements.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Nicholas for deputising for him 
 at the last meeting. Sue Black had been very busy contacting groups and 
 advertising her Village Agent’s work. Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the hedges 
 she had mentioned had been cut. Cllr Harris reported that the missing planks at 
 the Fanshawe Weir were not the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Peter 
 Spielberg, Lady Fanshawe’s estate manager was on the case. Cllr Nicholas 
 reported that communication with Mr Rob Stephens from the Educational Glebe 
 Office on the provision of new allotments was progressing.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 22nd September I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a 
 meeting at CDC of the Play Portfolio group. Katie Spencer gave a report on the 
 service delivery of Play Gloucestershire to communities in the District during 
 the summer. The group was concerned on how to fund the scheme when the Big 
 Lottery funding ceases. Other initiatives discussed included a Young Volunteer 
 Scheme for children which is proving particularly helpful for those with anger 
 management and various other issues. Cllr Stuart expressed his thanks for all 
 of the hard work the Play Rangers have done in South Cerney. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 29th September Cllr Stuart, Cllr Webb and I met 
 with our agents Chris Graham and Stuart Milsom of Moore Allen and Innocent to 
 inspect the recent refurbishment of the path at the western end of Upper Up 
 playing field. Path levels were confirmed and it was obvious that further 
 grading would be necessary to lessen the possibility of future flooding. More 
 gravel was needed for most of the path from the end of the cricket pitch 
 towards the Shire Ditch. On physical inspection it was determined that the 
 drainage pipe which had been installed was not of the proper design or laid at 
 a sufficient drop and would need to be replaced. Mr Graham will prepare a work 
 specification and ask suitable contractors for a quotation if agreement cannot 
 be reached with Bruton Knowles, agents for Thames Water to refurbish the path, 
 in accordance with agreements reached in March 2009. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 9th October I attended a meeting of the 
 Gloucestershire branch of the SLCC in Filton. Bruce Poole a clerk from Bleadon 
 in Somerset gave a talk on “Maintaining Good Relationships with Councillors”. A 
 programme of events for the next 12 months was discussed and various schemes 
 will be circulated to those members who did not attend to canvas their opinion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During September of the 22 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 36 minutes per day which is exactly the time allowed for in my 
 contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 12th OCTOBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelters in Station Road</b>. The Clerk reported 
 that he had ordered a new panel from Garrick Outdoor. The light fitting had 
 been replaced by Southern Electric in the shelter by the Limes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up path reinstatement.</b> Cllr Stuart reported 
 on a recent exercise by Murphy (Thames Water contractors) to complete the 
 outstanding reinstatement of the Upper Up path over the playing fields. Chris 
 Graham and Stuart Milson of Moore Allen and Innocent (Parish Council agents) 
 inspected the work on Tuesday 29th September and collected data on parts of the 
 work considered unacceptable. Cllr Webb and the Clerk accompanied the Chairman 
 during the inspection. Subsequently Chris Graham wrote to Bruton Knowles 
 (Thames Water agents) outlining failings that inspection had identified: (a) No 
 gravel has been placed on the section of path extending to 200 metres from the 
 cycle humps back towards the cricket pitch. The Terram is still showing through 
 and is a trip hazard; (b) The manholes are still significantly proud of ground 
 level; (c) The single drainage pipe that has been installed is not deep enough, 
 is a grey plastic downpipe connected into a black pipe, does not have any 
 drainage holes and does not fall consistently into the stream; (d) The ground 
 levels between the cycle humps and the ditch have not been changed so that 
 there is a natural fall towards the ditch; (e) We consider that there are still 
 potential drainage problems with this area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Actions to be Taken: It was previously advised that all 
 works to be completed by Thames Water and Murphy by 1st October. An email 
 confirmed that this was the case but regrettably the net result is 
 unsatisfactory. Accordingly, a detailed specification will be prepared and 
 three quotations obtained for the remedial works. Bearing in mind weather 
 conditions and timing generally, included with the specification will be a 
 requirement that works are undertaken within the next month and certainly 
 before weather conditions change. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart read a draft letter to the Directors’ Office 
 at Thames Water outlining the dissatisfaction of the Parish Council with the 
 overall behaviour of Murphy and Bruton Knowles. The Clerk was asked to copy the 
 correspondence to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP and our agents MAI.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shorncote Link.</b> Cllr Stuart reported that Mike 
 Barton, PROW gloucestershire County Council confirmed that Thames Water had 
 agreed that they will not be discharging water into the field where the damage 
 had occurred to the new footpath. Instead they will use the more westerly field 
 from where the water can flow into the brook quite easily. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wildmoorway Lane project.</b> Cllr Stuart stated that 
 work will start on Monday 19th October with the cutting back of the overgrown 
 trees followed by the digging/clearing of the ditch. These works should take 
 some four weeks depending on weather conditions. However, funding will be 
 needed to improve the surface of the path. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Stile-free footpaths.</b> Funding has been granted for 
 the replacement of all timber stiles in the Parish with metal kissing gates on 
 footpaths, hopefully starting on Mr William Seymour’s land in the near future. 
 The stone slab stiles will remain. A total of 53 new units will be added to the 
 existing kissing gates. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow.</b> Cllr Stuart agreed to 
 speak to Peter Spielberg regarding the state of Lady Fanshawe’s hedge in Bow 
 Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Shelter. </b>Cllr Stuart reported that the 
 footings underneath the youth shelter at Upper Up had not been repaired by Park 
 Leisure. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up car park refurbishment.</b> Cllr Stuart 
 suggested that the Parish Council considers dividing up the car park to provide 
 gated access to parts of it. Access could be by combination lock for members of 
 the clubs operating from the playing fields. Cllr Stuart volunteered to contact 
 the club organisers and ask for their reaction to such a plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Barracks Footpath.</b> Cllr Nicholas had spoken to Mrs 
 Slator and discussed the possibility of an agreement to divert the newly opened 
 footpath. Mrs Slator was not at all keen but would consider the proposal. 
 Apparently, the owners do not wish to have the footpath diverted to the centre 
 line of their paddocks and would prefer to have it where it has always been. 
 Arrangements had been made for PROW contractors to install a metal kissing gate 
 at the school end and to clear the young trees where required. No fencing is 
 planned to define the path which might be considered an invitation for 
 youngsters to cut across the paddock forcing a new entry into the playing field 
 through the hedge. Possibly the owners might permit a diversion to the very end 
 of the field alongside the river where there is already a good post and rail 
 fence which would mean a longer walk to get to the playground area and that 
 route is inclined to be very wet in winter with the river often flooding the 
 bank. Parish Councillors agreed with Cllr Nicholas who did not consider the 
 question urgent and it would be acceptable to wait and see how the use of the 
 path develops over time.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Drop Kerbs.</b> Cllr Mrs Land ascertained that the drop 
 kerbs had been requisitioned and as soon as finance was available 
 Gloucestershire Highways would start the installation beginning in Clarks Hay.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up biodiversity.</b> Cllr Nicholas was keen that 
 the Parish Council becomes involved in further developing the biodiversity 
 assets at Upper Up. Gareth Harris, Cotswold Water Park biodiversity officer 
 could be helpful in promoting schemes for this plan. The Clerk will email Mr 
 Harris suggesting that he considers meeting with Parish Councillors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Car Parking in Berkeley Close.</b> Cllr Caunce reported 
 that he had emailed Mr Lancaster but had no reply. Cllr Mrs Land had 
 distributed over 100 questionnaires to local residents and had only received 
 six replies. There was no dissension amongst the Committee when Cllr Harris 
 purported that car parking disputes were not the concern of the Parish Council. 
 Cllr Nicholas stated that he did not think that public parking was Parish 
 Council business. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to Cherry tree. </b>Cllr Harris had contacted 
 the individual responsible for damaging the Cherry tree to the north of the 
 junction of Riverway and Clarks Hay. He received assurances that a cheque for 
 £75 would be sent as compensation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hedge at Arragon.</b> The Clerk was asked to write to 
 Mr &amp; Mrs Baker thanking them for the good job which had been carried on cutting 
 back their hedge at Arragon. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hedge at Kewstoke. </b>The Clerk was asked to write to 
 Mr &amp; Mrs Dickson and request that they cut back the hedge along the footpath to 
 the side of their property leading from High Street to Meadow Way as it is 
 obscuring the public light, possibly comprising the safety of users.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. Both 
 Councillors reported that all was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play equipment was all in order. The tree on the 
 southern boundary, mid-way along, needed its crown raising to give better 
 visibility of the play area. Moss clearance of the safety surfaces was awaited.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the Fenplay safety areas awaited refurbishment. 
 Litter was still a minor problem on the cycle mounds although Cllr Stuart 
 suspected that it was not caused by the cyclists. Park Leisure had not repaired 
 the base of the Youth Shelter. Grass cuttings from the Cricket Club’s mowing 
 activities was still being dumped over areas where our contractor has to cut. 
 Although Cllr Stuart has complained to John Hunt (Cricket Club president) there 
 does not seem to be any sanction available to stop the practice. Cllr Stuart 
 reported that a memorial beech tree had died and would need to be replaced.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Adoption of red telephone boxes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had canvassed opinion from South Cerney Trust 
 members on the adoption of the telephone boxes. Seven out of ten had shown no 
 interest in retaining them. Conditions of their transfer had been obtained of 
 which the following were of interest: BT would automatically transfer the 
 billing for the power supply on adoption; the Parish Council would be 
 responsible for all support and maintenance of the kiosk following the transfer 
 of the kiosk. Cllr Caunce stated that there would be an emotional attachment by 
 certain residents to the retention of the boxes. Mr S. Wrigley commented that 
 the kiosks needed to be used for a viable purpose. It was agreed to make the 
 item an agenda item for the November meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendation to the Finance Committee </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommended that the Finance Committee 
 agrees to the quote from Tim Bryant for the refurbishment of the Fenplay safety 
 areas at Upper Up and the removal of moss covering the safety surfaces at 
 Cerney Wick.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Councillors’ Reports </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas was concerned with the growth of knot weed 
 alongside the river Churn in the vicinity of the Eliot Arms. Marstons Brewery, 
 owners of the Eliot Arms had emailed Land Registry documents proving that it 
 did not own the affected river bank although its land does come close. As 
 riparian ownership would be difficult to determine Cllr Nicholas was concerned 
 that this weed, if not controlled, would eventually damage the nearby bridge. 
 He continued that there was a means to control the growth if the weed was 
 injected in the autumn period. In view of the potential danger to the bridge he 
 argued that it would not set a precedent if the Parish Council was to become 
 involved in controlling the weed. The Committee agreed to a recommendation from 
 Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council should debate the problem at its next 
 meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Parish Council meeting Cllr Nicholas stated that 
 both Gloucestershire Highways and the Environment Agency had shown a notable 
 lack of interest in the problem of the knot weed and the potential damage it 
 could cause if left unchecked, as he surmised that dealing with it might set a 
 precedent in their view. Cllr Nicholas had obtained a quotation from Cotswold 
 Water Park Society to deal with the weed in anticipation of the Parish Council 
 agreeing that action should be taken. Cllr Parsons offered to take up the item 
 with Gloucestershire Highways because of the closeness of the bridge. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr 
 Harris that the quotation to deal with the weed from Cotswold Water Park 
 Society be accepted. Parish Councillors voted eight in favour, two against and 
 one abstention. The motion was therefore carried. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported that dog mess was a continuing 
 problem in Beverstone Road and Berkeley Close. Cllr Kimberley asked the Clerk 
 to request more signs from CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris and Cllr Jay reported that vandals had used 
 spray paint to disfigure the road surface in Bow Wow. Cllr Jay stated that 
 Gloucestershire County Council would remove it shortly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb asked the Clerk to write to Gloucestershire 
 Highways thanking them for installing the concrete path from the carriageway to 
 the new bus shelter in Station Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that he had spoken to the resident at 
 Sunset Cottage in Station Road who agreed to remove the red and white tape from 
 the Piece. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that Southern Electric had been 
 contracted to replace the vandalised light fitting in the bus shelter outside 
 the Limes. As the electric supply was continuous, with no isolating switch, it 
 had been necessary to use Southern Electric to do the work. The Clerk was asked 
 to enquire from Southern Electric if it was possible to provide an isolating 
 switch to the supply. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.33pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON
 MONDAY 12th OCTOBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb had 
 attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the expenditure detailed on the spread 
 sheet for period 6 was in order. Village maintenance expenditure was below 
 budget.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> The Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to the 
 quotation from Tim Bryant for the reinstatement of the Fenplay safety surfaces 
 and also the removal of the moss from the safety tiles at Cerney Wick. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee did not object to the above 
 recommendation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Parish Council accepts the quotation. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 selective basis and found everything to be in order. Cllr Jay noted the severe 
 reduction in bank deposit interest now being received. He congratulated the 
 Clerk on his bookwork. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence <br>
 </b>The response from CDC to the query on the disposition of Council Tax 
 collected from Second Homes was unhelpful. According to calculations from Cllr 
 Nicholas and Cllr Webb numbers of Second Homes given in the reply were 
 incorrect. The Clerk was to request from Mr Smith, Revenues and Benefits 
 Manager at CDC that a further response is considered and the explanation given 
 in terms which can be understood. </p>

 The Committee considered that it would be helpful if a start date on the scheme 
 could be notified if permission is granted. <br>
 Gavin Jones, Development Processes Officer at Gloucestershire County Council 
 had replied that should consent be granted there would be a planning condition 
 requiring the applicant to notify us of the date of commencement. Also for a 
 site of this scale we would expect the applicant to liaise with the local 
 community and keep them informed of operations, and that would include 
 commencement details. <br>

 The Committee agreed responses to a consultation from CDC on the contribution 
 made by Parish and Town Councils to the planning decision making process. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9.37pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DIVERSION OF FOOTPATHS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Further to the discussion reported on page 2598 of these 
 Minutes Cllr Nicholas explained the plan to divert other footpaths over the 
 playing fields at Upper Up. Mrs Berry, a neighbouring land owner, is in favour 
 of the plan to extinguish the path through her property to the other side of 
 the adjoining fence. Quite rightly, the Parish Council is concerned that the 
 Barracks footpath will be emerging onto Upper Up at a point which users then 
 must cross the road and if progressing to the nearby playing field must cross 
 back again in a short distance. The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Nicholas that any application for a diversion of the 
 footpaths should be held in abeyance for at least two years until an objective 
 view can be taken on the use of the Barracks footpath. The Clerk was asked to 
 inform Gloucestershire Highways about the exit/entry of the new footpath onto 
 Upper Up at Walnut Tree Farmhouse. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PERSONNEL COMMITTEE ON THE CLERK’S 
 ASSESSMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to leave the room while the report was 
 made by Cllr Jay. Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest as the Clerk 
 was a client of his firm. Other members of the public also left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Personnel Committee met on 30th September. Having now 
 received the 2009/2010 National Salary Award for Local Council Clerks, the 
 Personnel Committee recommended that in continuing recognition of the great 
 respect it has for the hard work and expertise shown by the Clerk it confirms 
 that the current Clerk’s salary should be in line with the incremental 
 structure set out in the above document. That is: Scale LC2 Range (b) step 35 
 back dated to 1st April 2009 and Scale LC2 range (b) step 36 as from 1st April 
 2010. The Casual Users car allowance of 60.1p per mile for the first 8,500 
 miles. In addition the Personnel Committee proposes that the Parish Council 
 accepts the joint recommendation of both The National Association of Local 
 Councils and the Society of Local Council Clerks that the minimum annual leave 
 from 1st April 2009 should be increased from 20 to 21 days with a further 4 
 days after 5 years continuous service. This means that our Clerk’s entitlement 
 is now 25 days annual leave. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Parish Council accepts the recommendations of the Personnel Committee. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas attended a meeting on 24th September at West 
 Manor Barn, Somerford Keynes with representatives of the Parish Councils of 
 Somerford Keynes and Ashton Keynes to discuss strategy on how to incorporate 
 pathways in and around Keynes Country Park into the definitive maps of Public 
 Rights of Way of both Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. The meeting included 
 Yvonne Jordan (Ashton Keynes PC), Sarah Powell &amp; Roger Sleeman (Somerford 
 Keynes PC), Amanda Keys (Operations Officer, Public Rights of Way, 
 Gloucestershire County Council), Councillor Shaun Parsons (Gloucestershire 
 County Council) and David Ryan-Ainslie, (Liaison Officer, CWPJC 1981 -96; 
 Countryside Services Manager, CWPS 1996-2001). It was agreed that a single 
 application would be made on behalf of all three Parish Councils with Somerford 
 Keynes as the contact address. Roger Sleeman had sent an e-mail to Siddington, 
 Poole Keynes and Kemble Parish Councils asking for their support for the 
 application. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) asked that Parish Councillors consider 
 his request for feedback on Youth Provision. Cllr Stuart suggested that he 
 contact Emily Hatchett and Mary Mychaleckyj from Young Gloucestershire for 
 up-to-date information. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported the sighting of a big sandy 
 coloured cat, possibly a puma on the outskirts of the village. Further 
 sightings should be reported to Gareth Harris, Biodiversity Officer at Cotswold 
 Water Park Society. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported that he had been informed that the 
 guttering of the bus shelter at the Limes had been completely ripped away. The 
 Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee will discuss the problem at 
 its next meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jenkins (CDC) reported that he was involved with the 
 disputed fishing rights of the Ashton Keynes angling club. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that an application to extend the 
 licence for the Crown Pub to cover activities in the paddock area of the Crown 
 had been granted albeit with restrictions: live music, and facilities for 
 making music, shall cease at 2300 hrs on all nights; regulated entertainment 
 shall only take place within the marquee during the months of July, August and 
 September; no amplified music shall be played within the marquee at any time. 
 All conditions can be viewed in the Minutes of the licensing panel at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had attended the Lantern Project exhibition in 
 Cirencester. He also attended a presentation by Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue 
 Service which highlighted the availability of free home fire safety checks and 
 asked that the service be promoted in Cerney News. He reported that Bill Collis 
 had informed him that a tree in the hedge at the Laurels was covered in ivy. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting held on 21st September 
 with members of the Scout Association including Tom Harding, County 
 Commissioner and Peter Greirson, District Manager, Cllr Peter Jay (also 
 representing Cerney Trust) and Ian Kennedy, Chairman of South Cerney’s Scout 
 Association. Ian explained his frustration in his attempts to get the National 
 Headquarters involved in determining a plan to take account of when the current 
 lease on the scout hut in Berkeley Close expired in 2014. Cllr Stuart had 
 consequently involved Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP in an attempt to provoke a 
 reaction. Further concern was that the area could be used to build affordable 
 housing when the lease finished. Discussion on the future continued and it was 
 considered that there was the need for a youth meeting facility, preferably in 
 Berkeley Close. If a temporary building was erected alongside the existing 
 building all services could be shared. If, after a suitable period, it is found 
 that there is indeed a need for a Youth Centre, then we can design and build 
 such a facility incorporating an upgraded Scout section. Before action can be 
 taken approval by the National Headquarters is required. Ian Kennedy will email 
 this request and if no response is received within two weeks the County 
 Commissioner will take action directly with the National Headquarters. Cllr 
 Bennett (CDC) remarked that the District Council is still working to the Local 
 Plan policies while our Forward Planning team is looking at the Local 
 Development Framework and how the current policies will fit in. It is therefore 
 essential that the Parish Council contacts Chris Vickery (CDC Forward Planning) 
 as soon as possible if it wishes the scout hut land to be changed from 
 ‘housing’ to ‘leisure’ or something that will ensure the long term future of 
 the scout hut/youth centre.</p>
