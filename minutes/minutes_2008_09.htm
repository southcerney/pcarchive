 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the YPC was in attendance. Cllr Harris asked 
 that the Clerk contact Joe Lodge to ascertain the outcome of his meeting with 
 residents, in the vicinity of the MUGA at Upper Up playing field, who were 
 concerned about its installation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land was persuaded by Cllr Nicholas to defer her 
 comments relating to the Traffic Survey as it had been discussed at the Finance 
 Committee meeting and would be mentioned in that report made later in the 
 meeting. Then she would have an opportunity to debate the subject.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 26th August I attended an extraordinary meeting 
 of the Finance Committee at the Village Hall at 7pm summoned on the 
 instructions of Cllr Stuart. Also in attendance were Councillors Jay, Mrs Land, 
 Nicholas, Stuart and Webb. Cllr Stuart had called the meeting to progress the 
 motion passed at the previous Parish Council meeting which had agreed to 
 contact Hamilton-Baillie Associates, traffic consultants to enquire how much it 
 would cost to produce a traffic plan for the village. After a discussion it was 
 agreed that there was sufficient funds in reserve and allocated to allow for 
 the production of such a plan. It was recognised that other consultants should 
 also be approached and to this end Cllr Nicholas agreed to approach Peter 
 Finlayson, a resident who was involved professionally in such planning, to 
 enquire if he could recommend other like consultancies. Cllr Stuart stated that 
 Chris Franklin of Gloucestershire Highways had informed him that he would be 
 willing to consider working with any professional outfit which might produce a 
 traffic plan. Cllr Jay had retrieved an email dated 18th June 2007 from Paola 
 Spivach of Hamilton-Baillie which gave an outline of what might be expected 
 from such a survey. See Correspondence item number 12. Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 7.45pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 27th August I attended a meeting of the Planning 
 Regulatory Committee at CDC where the Ham Cottage planning application was 
 discussed. Cllr Nicholas spoke on behalf of the Parish Council objecting to the 
 application. Mrs Carolyn Kennedy spoke on behalf of the residents who objected. 
 There was no decision taken on the application as the Committee decided to have 
 an All Members site visit to inspect the implications of the proposed building. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 28th August I attended a meeting of the Gloucestershire 
 Charter group at 7pm held at the Fire Station in Gloucester. The main speaker 
 was John Lane, PROW who illustrated his talk with an interesting slide show. 
 Most informative was the outcome of the survey taken of all the 3,430 miles of 
 bridleways, footpaths, byways and restricted byways that make up the Public 
 Rights of Way network in the county. All assets have been recorded with 
 photographs stored of stiles and bridges which can now be accessed easily on 
 the in-house computer system. He explained that the survey would be kept up to 
 date through a schedule of inspections which he calculated would complete every 
 5 years. As with every department in the County Council the budget was 
 extremely tight and was stretched to cope after the July 2007 floods. Severn 
 Trent Water had donated £500,000 but had attached conditions to the grant so 
 that the money could only be used within the area it supplied and then only on 
 repair to flood damaged assets and not for general maintenance. Martyn 
 Summerell deputised for Chris Rogan, Director of Atkins, Environment 
 Directorate. Martyn gave a report on gulley clearing which would be completed 
 in this financial year. Some gullies were proving difficult to clear and if 
 after charging, a restriction had not been removed, return visits were made 
 with more sophisticated equipment. No gulley had withstood a third visit. 
 Generally he was pleased with the progress being made on the refurbishment of 
 the highways and previous expectations of expense had been revised downwards. 
 The next meeting was arranged for October 30th when a member of the Archives 
 department would give a talk. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During August of the 20 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours and 20 minutes per day which is approximately 15 minutes less per day 
 than my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th SEPTEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had sent an apology for his absence as he was 
 on holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had asked the Clerk to remind members of other 
 Committees of the Walk on Wednesdays (WoW) scheme scheduled for 10th September. 
 Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and 
 Cllr Walker had taken part. The exercise was considered worthwhile as there 
 were a lot less cars in the car park than usual. Cllr Jay thanked colleagues 
 for taking part and apologised for his absence as he was working. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2438 – <b>Safety Surface at Upper Up</b>. The Clerk 
 was asked to remind George Taylor that the safety surface had not yet been 
 repaired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2439 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards</b>. Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb was continuing to research costs from various contractors and would have 
 a proposal to submit for consideration at the November Parish Council meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2439 – <b>Maintenance of Land in Public Ownership</b>. 
 Cllr Stuart, Cllr Webb and the Clerk had met to discuss how to produce a 
 schedule of work required. The Clerk had contacted Glebe Contractors for advice 
 and a representative had met with Cllr Stuart. Cllr Stuart reported that the 
 discussions with Glebe Contractors highlighted the impossibility of accurately 
 listing jobs and believed that the current method of “on demand” reaction 
 catered for the present needs. The Clerk was asked to put this item on the 
 October agenda. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2440 – <b>Laurel Hedge at Pocket Park, Jubilee 
 Gardens</b>. Two quotations had been received. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Committee accepts the lower 
 quotation. The Committee decided to accept the lower. The Clerk was asked to 
 inform the Finance Committee and request its approval. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2440 – <b>Letter to Kelvin Wearing</b>. The Clerk 
 informed Committee that Cllr Stuart had asked him not to release the letter 
 thanking Mr Wearing for his work on the footpath hedge as there was some 
 confusion if he had in fact been responsible for the task. After correspondence 
 emails had been analysed the Committee ordered the Clerk to send the letter to 
 Mr Wearing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2441 – <b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b>. The Clerk 
 reported that he had written to Betec informing them that the adhesion of the 
 surface material on the notice board was not acceptable and that the backing in 
 the covered area needed to be upgraded. Cllr Caunce would contact Betec to 
 expedite the work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2441 – <b>Hedge at entrance to Cerney Wick play area.</b> 
 Cllr Caunce was satisfied with the completed work carried out by David King and 
 asked the Clerk to recommend to the Finance Committee that his invoice is paid. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2445 – <b>Overgrowing hedge on PROW at 4 Churn Close</b>. 
 Cllr Harris noted that some work had been carried out on the hedge. The Clerk 
 was asked to contact Mrs Roberts for confirmation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2446 – <b>Geoffrey Franklin</b>. Cllr Harris had been 
 unable to make contact with Mr Franklin about the state of his ditches, but 
 would continue trying. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2446 – <b>Hedge at Lynton, School Lane</b>. Cllr 
 Caunce had contacted the residents who had cut back their overgrowing hedge and 
 pointed out to him how they would realign future growth.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker carried out his first inspection of the play 
 area and made the following observations: Toddlers Play Area – 1. One piece of 
 wood loose on top of the rear carriage; 2. Two wheels missing from the main 
 train (totally removed). Play Equipment for Older Children – 1. Platform of 360 
 deg Swing is loose and needs tightening; 2. Twelve protection mats are loose 
 and uneven needing to be secured with plastic ties, dirt and grass needs to be 
 cleaned off to lay flat. Senior Swings – 1. Aluminium swing badly bent; 2. Bolt 
 has no washer and is wearing away aluminium seat; 3. Swing needs to be replaced 
 as rubber seat is past is wear and tear; 4. Ten safety mats require securing 
 with black ties and cleaning out and laying back down flat. Hags Play Unit – 1. 
 Missing a piece of wood from side of climbing frame; 2. Approximately twenty 
 safety mats require securing with black ties and cleaning out and laying back 
 down flat. Picnic Table &amp; Seat – 1. Picnic table centre piece broken on right 
 hand side (requires replacing as soon as possible); 2. Picnic table fourth 
 piece also broken on left side (requires replacing as soon as possible). High 
 Fence &amp; Hedge on Lakeside Boundary – 1. Fence ripped by stile and also small 
 hole appearing by horse riding sign. General comments: 1. Grass requires 
 cutting all over the park; 2. Grass has been thrown over the fence from 
 adjacent properties onto the playing field. Old and new cuttings can be seen 
 very clearly and even stuck to the fence; 3. There are also a few branches 
 hanging really low over bridle path, affecting horse riders but not 
 pedestrians, that require cutting down. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris and Cllr Walker agreed to a suggestion from 
 Cllr Caunce that both meet to reappraise the points raised in the report and 
 make a joint recommendation of the work needed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">However, it was agreed that contractors are asked to quote 
 to repair the picnic table. Cllr Walker will email the photographic evidence to 
 the Clerk who will pass it on to selected contractors. Because of the urgency 
 of the repair a deadline for replies of Wednesday 10th September would be 
 imposed. The Clerk reported that two quotations had been received. The Parish 
 Council agreed to accept the lower and would vote later.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had emailed his report prior to his departure 
 on holiday. The safety surface of the activity has not been repaired. Murphy 
 has still to connect the drainage pipe at the Cycle Mounds. The surface of the 
 car park is in reasonable condition. Reinstatement of the surfaces over new 
 pipeline and the extension of the permissive path to the Shorncote Link are on 
 going. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had expressed his disappointment with the 
 contractors Park Leisure who installed the equipment. He recommended that 
 payment should be withheld until unsatisfactory construction elements had been 
 rectified. He was particularly concerned with the finish beneath the youth 
 shelter, track indentations on the tarmac area and other hazards noted at the 
 post installation inspection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that he had sent a copy of the post 
 inspection report to James McGrath, Park Leisure representative who would visit 
 the site on Friday 12th September.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that the ditch and hedge work had all 
 been cleared to the front of the play area and the visibility for road users 
 improved.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was agreed that Finance Committee be requested to 
 accept the following recommendations: The invoice presented by David King for 
 work at Cerney Wick be paid; that the lower quote from R.O.W. Berry to prune 
 the laurel hedge on the Pocket Park, Jubilee Gardens for £95 be accepted.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the ground maintenance 
 contractors had not cut the south side of the open ditch near the Piece in 
 Station Road on the two previous occasions. The Clerk was to ask Glebe 
 Contractors to investigate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the high dry stone wall of the 
 river bank adjacent to Mr Genillard’s house, in Bow Wow had been damaged by a 
 tracked excavator which had pushed out the wall whilst manoeuvring. The ivy 
 cover was hiding the damage. The Clerk was to ask Chris Franklin, 
 Gloucestershire Highways (GH) to investigate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge did not think that the repair to the 
 highway surface, at Amber Mead in Silver Street, made after the new tarmac had 
 just been laid, was good enough. A previous email from Gillian Portlock stated 
 that contractors had 6 months to make good repairs. The Clerk will add it to 
 the watch list and remind GH in February 2009 if the matter has not been 
 resolved satisfactorily. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker was concerned about fly tipping from the rear 
 of properties adjacent to the Robert Franklin Way on to the playing field. The 
 Clerk was asked to write to the occupants to request that they desist from this 
 practice. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had emailed his extreme annoyance to the 
 Committee with the standard of work and damage caused by contractors of 
 Gloucestershire Highways working on the banks of the river Churn in Bow Wow. 
 The Millennium Seat had been damaged, relief for recent flooding had been 
 achieved by cutting drainage channels from the area through the side of the 
 bank thereby washing away top soil and exposing the mesh of the wire baskets 
 which were hazardous to animals and young children. The Clerk was asked to 
 arrange a meeting with Chris Franklin of GH to discuss the concerns of Parish 
 Councillors. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Jay and Cllr Harris volunteered to attend if 
 available. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to write to Mr Stansfield to 
 suggest that he allows the Parish Council to remove the hedging and other 
 growth from the south of his property, bordering the river Churn in order that 
 the view of the church might be improved for those resting on the Millennium 
 Seat opposite.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;There being no further business Cllr Caunce had 
 closed the meeting at 8:22pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th 
 SEPTEMBER</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm.. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent an apology for his absence as he was on holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traffic Plan</b> <br>
 It had been agreed at an Extraordinary Meeting of the Finance Committee that 
 other consultancies should be considered to provide a traffic plan for the 
 village. The Committee had considered Cllr Stuart’s suggestion that a 
 questionnaire be sent to all households to determine residents’ opinion on what 
 was necessary. Cllr Nicholas stated that it was important that the Parish 
 Council did not have a knee-jerk reaction to recent lobbying and careful 
 thought must be applied before any decision is taken. The Clerk reported that 
 one resident had volunteered to join the sub-committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Hall Roof</b> <br>
 The Finance Committee recommends that the Parish Council approves the plan for 
 rethatching the ridge of the Village Hall roof and requests that the Parish 
 Council accordingly engages the services of a recommended contractor. There was 
 no objection from Parish Councillors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce would contact Betec to expedite the completion of the work on the 
 notice board. Cllr Jay stated that, until the contract had been finished to a 
 satisfactory standard, payment would continue to be withheld. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Generally the spread sheet indicated that the expenses of the Parish Council 
 were within the allocated budget. By inserting the expenditure for the MUGA 
 surface in the budget analysis for Village Maintenance it had distorted the 
 spend percentage. It was agreed that the amount should be transferred from 
 column “N” to column “X” as it had been allocated to the Reserve Fund.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th 
 SEPTEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas had opened the meeting at 9.10pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent an apology for his absence as he was on holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/E/3 adherence of planning conditions <br>
 </b>Temporary use of existing building as a fishing equipment shop in 
 association with existing fisheries on Lakes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 16 at Lake 11, 
 Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney Conditions of note: <br>
 2. By 5th September 2008, the permitted use shall stop. Unless further planning 
 permission is granted in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the 
 expiry date, the use permitted shall permanently cease. <br>
 Reason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to give further consideration to 
 the acceptability of the proposed use after the temporary period has expired. 
 This condition is attached in the light of Circular 11/95. <br>
 3. The application site shall be used only for the sale of fishing equipment 
 and for no other purpose, including any other purpose in Class A1 of the 
 Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 2005 or the 
 equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument amending or replacing the 
 2005 Order or any other change of use permitted by the Town and Country 
 Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. <br>
 Reason: It is essential that the Local Planning Authority retains control over 
 the use of the premises because unrestricted retail development may not be 
 acceptable in an open countryside location. Another planning application will 
 be necessary if it is proposed to change the use of the premises to any use 
 other than that specified in this condition. This condition is appropriate in 
 the light of advice within PPS1 and Circular 11/95. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to ask the Enforcement Officer to check if 
 the conditions were being breached.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>07/02826/FUL CT.7528/D</b> <br>
 Mr Ian Kennedy expressed his praise of the Planning (Regulatory) Committee 
 which he had observed, albeit from a distance, for the well conducted site 
 visit of CDC Councillors made recently. There were 17 people in the party and 
 the inspection took 50 minutes. Cllr Clarke (CDC) concurred stating that the 
 site visit was well organised and conducted very professionally. He had 
 attended as Ward Member. Mr Napper from the Planning Department at CDC was 
 there and also an officer from Gloucestershire Highways. Mr Kennedy recalled 
 that in 2002 all surrounding rear gardens were under water and he is convinced 
 that if onethird of the land is covered in concrete it will be liable to flood. 
 Recently the growth on the field had been mown and he had reported the 
 potential destruction of the Great Crested Newt habitat to PC Jon Palfrey. Cllr 
 Nicholas reported that he had spoken on the Parish Council’s objection to the 
 revised scheme for a proposed house in the garden of Ham Cottage, Ham Lane at 
 the Planning (Regulatory) Committee meeting on 27th August. The Committee had 
 decided to have a full meeting on the site before voting on the application 
 which will be held on 17th September and either Cllr Nicholas or the Clerk will 
 give the Parish Council’s reasons for its objection then. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>06/00525/FUL CT.2648/3/P</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb recalled that a condition had been imposed on the granted application 
 for the lodges on Lake 10, Waters Edge, Cerney Wick Lane and was concerned that 
 they were not being observed. The Clerk would inform the Enforcement Officer.
 <br>
 Conditions of note: <br>
 16. No part of the proposed development shall be brought into beneficial use 
 until the pedestrian/cycle link to the spine road cycle path has been 
 permanently constructed in accordance with the submitted details. Reason: To 
 ensure the provision of safe cycle/pedestrian links to the existing water park 
 cycle routes. <br>
 17. No part of the proposed development shall be brought into beneficial use 
 until the public foot-path through the site has been upgraded to a standard 
 suitable for wheelchair use in accordance with details, which shall have been 
 submitted for approval by the Local Planning Authority. <br>
 Reason: To provide and enhance facilities in the Water Park for disabled 
 people. Cllr Caunce volunteered to speak with Sean Hodgson a director of the 
 Waters Edge development to ascertain his reasons for the alleged breach of 
 conditions.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications received by CDC</b></p>

 Applicant: Mr M. Thomas, c/o Watermark, Isis Lakes, Spine Road, South Cerney
 <br>
 Proposal: Construction of a motel with car park (revised scheme) on land at 
 Lake 7, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney <br>
 The amended plans do not overcome the reasons for the previous objections made 
 by South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council, namely: The proposed motel 
 development would fundamentally change the character of this rural location, as 
 viewed from the adjoining footpaths. The Parish Council is concerned as to the 
 precise appearance of the proposed buildings. The amended plans still show no 
 details describing the roof colour to be used. Conditions requested if 
 permission is granted as follows:<br>
 1. A wheel wash to be mandatory for all vehicles exiting the site during 
 construction. <br>
 2. A dedicated lane should be installed, to allow traffic accessing the motel 
 to turn right safely. <br>
 3. There is now sufficient reason with the level of new development along this 
 stretch of the B4696 (Spine Road) to reduce the speed limit to 40mph between 
 Station Road/Cerney Wick Lane junction north towards the A419 or to the line of 
 the old canal which is the Gloucestershire/Wiltshire border.<br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked Cllr Clarke (CDC) if he could 
 investigate what procedures were in place to monitor the occupancy of holiday 
 homes in the Water Park. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb stated that it was not a fair distribution of 
 Council Tax throughout the county when the parish of South Cerney with Cerney 
 Wick had a 13.1% density of second homes while the average was 3.2% and did not 
 benefit directly yet facilities to sustain these properties were similar to 
 those of regular dwellings and their occupants. If their legal rights were 
 observed, these part time residents would be entitled to vote in local 
 elections. Cllr Parsons (GCC) conceded that the scheme was part of the rating 
 system. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb requested that a dog bin be installed at or near 
 the entrance to the allotments at the end of Church Lane as such waste was 
 being put in the bins inside the church yard which was unacceptable. The Clerk 
 will include the request in the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Agenda 
 for its October meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform Gloucestershire 
 Highways that the drain outside Lower Churn House in Bow Wow needs to be 
 cleared out. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris informed his colleagues that the deadline for 
 photographs for the proposed village calendar was 22nd September. He asked 
 Parish Councillors if they could indicate, by email, to the Clerk if the 13th 
 or 20th at 10am or 3pm would be most acceptable. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris remarked that the WoW (Walk on Wednesdays) 
 initiative was a worthwhile exercise as evidenced by the lack of cars in the 
 school car park. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr 
 Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker had all taken part. Cllr Jay thanked his 
 colleagues for attending and apologised for his absence as he was working. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay informed the Parish Council that he and Cllr 
 Stuart had met with Mr Robert Westell Area Estates Manager at Aggregate 
 Industries to discuss how to improve the permissive path on Lake 16 to the rear 
 of Kingfisher Place to Huxley Court and possibly beyond. Mr Westell will 
 consider a suggestion that if Aggregate Industries supplied the material to 
 construct a more accessible path, the Parish Council would try and persuade the 
 Pay Back in the Community team to supply the labour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb had a request for a small seat to be 
 erected in the bus shelter. Cllr Jay stated that the seats had been removed 
 some 10 years or so ago as they encouraged anti social behaviour. The Clerk was 
 asked to include the request in the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
 Agenda for its October meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to report to the

 Wick Sailing Club and ask them politely if they could cut back the hedge 
 surrounding their property alongside the road, towards Cerney Wick.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that cyclists were still using 
 public footpaths endangering pedestrians. She could not be sure, however, if 
 the culprits were local people or holiday makers. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land informed colleagues that she had attended a 
 session at CDC on Understanding Planning hosted by Mr Kevin Field (CDC). She 
 was not impressed with the presentation of the subject and considered it a 
 waste of time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay stated that the reinstatement work in Bow Wow was 
 unsatisfactory. By raising the height of the bank flooding after recent rain 
 had occurred which had been relieved by digging out a trench to drain the 
 excess to the river. This in turn washed away the top soil of the gabion 
 baskets exposing the mesh which was hazardous to children and animals. There 
 had also been significant damage caused to the Millennium Seat. Cllr Harris 
 reported that the dry stone wall, part of the river bank, had been damaged 
 also. Cllr Jay asked the Clerk to arrange a meeting on site with Chris 
 Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways to discuss these matters.</p>
