 Webb that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and 
 Cllr Nicholas abstained as both had not attended the meeting. The remainder of 
 the Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Michael Brown, Joe Lodge, Sinead Peare and Jasmine 
 Tresadern of the Youth Parish Council attended the meeting and Joe Lodge gave a 
 brief resumé of their activities. Joe apologised for the group not attending 
 previous meetings. Joe had finished first in his group trekking over Dartmoor 
 in the Ten Tors competition. Cllr Stuart, on behalf of the Parish Council, 
 congratulated him on this achievement. Joe continued that the group had 
 reorganised itself and new responsibilities delegated. There had been 
 discussion on replacing the basketball hoop but no firm decision had been 
 reached except all agreed that they did not want to extend the tarmac area. The 
 group were researching a series of play equipment and when a decision was 
 reached they would inform the Parish Council of its proposals. Cllr Mrs Land 
 stressed the importance of choosing equipment which would be suitable for the 
 less agile members of the community. Cllr Nicholas advised that if a safety 
 surface was needed it could prove expensive and careful thought must be applied 
 to this element of any package. The Parish Council agreed to remove the 
 basketball post and hoop and the Clerk would arrange for this to be carried 
 out. Sinead Peare requested the Chairman to promote the YPC report at the AGM 
 on 20th May. The Chairman agreed to call for the report before the Police made 
 theirs. The Clerk agreed to invite either Mary Mychaleckyj or Emily Hallett to 
 support the group at the AGM. Cllr Jay wished the group well in their 
 forthcoming examinations. They then all left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land reported that she had attended the Police 
 Consultative Committee meeting in Siddington on 15th April. She raised the 
 on-going parking problem especially in the centre of South Cerney and was 
 expecting a report from the PCSOs at the next meeting which will be held in the 
 Village Hall, South Cerney sometime in July. Cllr Stuart thanked her for 
 attending the meeting and said that it was much appreciated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce noted that there had been no progress in the 
 construction of a path on Lake 10 which was a condition of the development and 
 that action was also awaited on the work outside the Four Pillars hotel. The 
 last communication stated that the District Council was awaiting a response 
 from Gloucestershire County Council on its assessment of the proposal. Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) asked the Clerk to let him have a copy of the latest 
 correspondence regarding the matter. He was also disappointed that no action 
 had been taken by CDC in enforcing the removal of advertisements which did not 
 have permission. He suggested that a senior manager from CDC should be asked to 
 attend a meeting of Parish Councillors and explain the reasons for the delay. 
 Parish Councillors did not commit themselves and there was no proposition 
 considered. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that he had been informed that the 
 sewage leak near the Lakeside car park had been repaired. Cllr Kimberley 
 reported that he had experienced a strong stench of sewage on the previous 
 Sunday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During April of the 10 available working days I averaged 5 
 hours 50 minutes per day which is more than 2 hours a day in excess of my 
 contract. This was due to preparing the Parish Council’s accounts for audit and 
 completing the minutes and agenda for the Annual Parish meeting on 20th May. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart informed the meeting that while the Clerk was 
 on holiday an incident occurred and access to the insurance documents had been 
 necessary. The Clerk had picked up the email, telephoned back and arranged for 
 him to retrieve the paperwork from his office. Cllr Stuart thanked the Clerk 
 for his cooperation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SUPPORT OF SOMERFORD KEYNES PARISH COUNCIL</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas stated that Somerford Keynes Parish Council 
 had expressed its concern over the threat to curtail the historic public access 
 to Keynes Country Park. There was uncertainity over the plans of the new lessee 
 regarding the permissive rights of way. If the new sub-lease prevented access 
 serious public displeasure would result in a valid potential problem. Cllr 
 Nicholas continued that the legal set up was unnecessarily obtuse. There was 
 also concern that Gloucestershire County Council may have acted ultra vires 
 (outside the control of the authority). The lease clearly forbade the lessee, 
 Watermark Investments Developments Ltd, to construct holiday lodges. Buildings 
 could be erected for the benefit of staff and security. Cllr Parsons (GCC) said 
 that assurances had been given that access to the permissive rights of way 
 would continue although between dusk and dawn it would be restricted because 
 security needed to be maintained. There was a possibility that at some future 
 date access to permissive rights of way may be rescinded. There was no threat 
 to the PROW. Cllr Jay mentioned that there were at least two instances where 
 access had been blocked. Cllr Parsons (GCC) was aware but countered that the 
 action had been reversed soon afterwards. Cllr Jay thanked Cllr Nicholas for 
 his research on the implications of the lease. Somerford Keynes Parish Council 
 had referred the action of GCC to the Audit Commission querying if best value 
 had been achieved and who else had been invited to bid for the concession. Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) informed the Parish Council that the Audit Commission’s report 
 was expected this month. Cllr Harris informed the council that the park was now 
 called Cotswold Country Park. Cllr Parsons (GCC) said that officers at 
 Gloucestershire County Council were responsible for drawing up the lease and in 
 his view proper procedures were abided by. Cllr Nicholas explained the 
 differences and implications of a Public Right of Way and a Permissive Right of 
 Way. Cllr Stuart said that the public purse had financed the Water Park all to 
 no avail to the local public. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council supports Somerford Keynes 
 Parish Council in its endeavours to ensure future public access to Cotswold 
 Country Park is maintained. The Parish Council was unanimous in its agreement 
 with the proposal.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 11th MAY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce opened the meeting at 7 pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Meeting with Gloucestershire Highways representatives.
 </b>Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart had a meeting with Chris Franklin and Paul Swift 
 of Gloucestershire Highways. During the meeting which lasted about 90 minutes, 
 the trees in the Bow Wow, 20 mph zones and tactile paving were discussed. 
 Discussions about the trees in Bow Wow were progressing and the scruffy Ash 
 tree by the water’s edge will be dealt with in the near future. Chris Franklin 
 will arrange for the damaged wall to be rebuilt. Reinstatement of Bow Wow will 
 take place, after the Gas Board has relaid the mains pipe there, later in the 
 year. The Clerk was to ask Dave Ludford, Environment Agency, to continue to 
 keep the Parish Council informed of developments. Action on converting parts of 
 the village to a 20 mph zone should await national government direction as its 
 intention to create such zones had been broadcast recently. Better pedestrian 
 crossing points in Silver Street, High Street, Clarks Hay and Broadway Lane 
 were discussed and it was agreed that Paul Swift will liaise with Cllr Mrs Land 
 regarding the installation of tactile pavements. Gloucestershire Highways is 
 aware of the proliferation of advertising signs along the Spine Road, 
 especially at the junction of Station Road, Cerney Wick Lane and Spine Road 
 crossroads. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grand Opening of facilities at Upper Up.</b> Cllr 
 Caunce remarked on the successful opening of new facilities on the Upper Up 
 playing fields. £167 had been collected from the sale of tickets for the prize 
 of a tandem parachute jump. The Committee agreed with Cllr Stuart who 
 recommended that the proceeds should be given to the Help for Heroes charity 
 and that the Parish Council consider increasing the donation by £83 to make a 
 total of £250. It further recommended that the Parish Council considers making 
 a £25 donation to the Salvation Army in recognition of its band’s performance 
 at the opening. Committee members agreed to a suggestion that the Parish 
 Council record its thanks and appreciation to Alan and Sarah Browning from Red 
 Onion for providing refreshments. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shorncote Link.</b> Cllr Stuart reported that work to 
 complete the path at the western end of the Upper Up playing field was still 
 unsatisfactory. He had informed Stuart Milsom (MAI) who in turn would contact 
 Richard Maggs (Thames Water) and request that satisfactory completion is 
 awaited.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grass Cutting.</b> Cllr Mrs Chapman had informed Cllr 
 Caunce that in her opinion grass cutting in Cerney Wick was below standard. 
 Cllr Caunce had informed Adrian Gibbs and a close watch will be kept on the 
 contractor’s work in future. In defence of Adrian Gibbs, Cllr Stuart remarked 
 that over the period in discussion the growth of grass had been exceptionally 
 fast and possibly the contractor who had introduced new equipment had not quite 
 mastered the machinery. Cllr Mrs Chubb remarked that residents in her 
 neighbourhood were very pleased with the latest cut. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Bus Shelter.</b> Cllr Caunce had spoken 
 with Paul Swift, Gloucestershire Highways about the proposed positioning the 
 bus shelter. Mr Swift had no objection and reconfirmed that Gloucestershire 
 Highways would provide a pathway from the shelter to the road. Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 reported that not one of the contractors which the Clerk had asked to quote had 
 contacted her for information. Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to let him have the 
 names and contact details and he would try to get a result. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had persuaded Kevin Messenger to quote for 
 laying a concrete base. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
 that the Parish Council accepts. The Parish Council was in agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewerage Leak.</b> Cllr Kimberley reported that the 
 stench of sewage in Station Road, near to Lakeside car park was still a 
 problem. Cllr Harris will make more enquiries to try and resolve what action 
 has been taken or is needed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dog Litter Signs.</b> Cllr Kimberley thanked the Clerk 
 for providing self adhesive labels which alerted pet owners to the necessity of 
 clearing up after their animals foul public areas. He had received more 
 complaints about the state of Gypsy Lane. The Dog Wardens are aware and will be 
 keeping a look out for miscreants. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Parking Problems in Berkeley Close.</b> Cllr Kimberley 
 reported that parking arrangements in Berkeley Close were becoming problematic. 
 He suggested that the Parish Council considers approaching Fosseway Housing to 
 see if it would agree to converting part of its grassed area for car parking 
 purposes. The Clerk would add this item to the agenda for the next Committee 
 meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play area was all in order. There was a tree 
 leaning out towards the road which needed to be removed. Cllr Caunce had 
 liaised with Stephen Wrigley, Chairman of the Cerney Wick Village Committee and 
 agreed a resolution to the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. All 
 equipment was in order. Upper Up Cllr Stuart reported that there was some 
 broken pallet wood which needed to be removed from the cycle mounds. Although 
 Eddie Curtis is currently on sick leave he has delegated the litter picking job 
 which is being carried out satisfactorily except in the area around the 
 recycling area. Despite assurances from CDC that the area will be kept tidy by 
 SITA, nothing has been done to improve the situation in the past week. Cllr 
 Stuart is also becoming increasingly alarmed by the damage caused to the 
 surface when the bins are changed. The ground is becoming badly gouged and a 
 danger to pedestrians. The Clerk will inform Scott Williams (CDC) of the 
 problem. In the light of a clean up and safety issues Cllr Jay stated that he 
 will propose a resolution for next month’s agenda that the bins are removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to top up the donation to the Help for Heroes charity achieved through the sale 
 of tickets for the tandem parachute jump by £83 to £250. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to donate £25 to the Salvation Army towards their expenses incurred in 
 performing at the opening ceremony at Upper Up playing fields.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to contract Tim Bryant to repair the fence at Lakeside.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the surface of the PROW BSC13 
 from Station Road to Bow Wow is in need of attention. The Clerk will inform 
 Mike Barton at Gloucestershire County Council PROW. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked that the Committee agrees to the use of 
 Upper Up as an over flow car park for those attending the Duck Race and 
 associated events of the Street Fair. The Committee had no objection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas enquired what should be done with wooden 
 planks left over from the erection of the compost bins. It was agreed that Cllr 
 Harris would store them for future use by the group. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas noted that there was no reference to any 
 financial contribution to the restoration of BSC20 Wildmoorway Lane to Wilmoor 
 Lock. Cllr Stuart had been in discussions with the Water Park Society and 
 hopefully would enlighten the Parish Council at its meeting on Wednesday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had spoken to Jill Bewley from the Cotswold 
 Water Park Society regarding their applications for grants to improve BSC20. 
 The application for the previous grant had been unsuccessful but it had been 
 resubmitted. Ms Bewley told Cllr Stuart that for every £1 committed by other 
 agencies as a grant would mean £3 for the Society if the appeal was successful. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Task List was projected and updated. Cllr Webb and the 
 Clerk will meet to decide on a strategy to involve the Gloucestershire Charter 
 group in expediting the completion of the cycleway enhancement opposite the 
 Four Pillars hotel. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.25pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY
 11th MAY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SPREAD SHEET ANALYSIS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the expenditure detailed on the spread 
 sheet was in order although the Cost of Employing the Clerk was distorted as 
 period 1 coincided with an accumulated payment to HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE PLAYING FIELDS
 AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to top up the donation of £167 to 
 the Help for Heroes charity achieved through the sale of tickets for the tandem 
 parachute jump by £83 to £250. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr 
 Caunce that the Parish Council accepts this recommendation. The Parish Council 
 was in agreement. </p>

 recommendations.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to inform Fosseway Living that 
 the front fence hedge at 30 Broadway Lane was overgrowing the public footpath 
 impeding pedestrian access. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger thanked Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart for the 
 help provided to Siddington Parish Council in preparing its questionnaire on 
 its Village Plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that WoW, Walk on Wednesday initiative 
 at Ann Edwards School was in full swing and the award would be determined at 
 the end of this half term. The winning pupils will vote on which “Reward Days” 
 they wish to take part. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that on 21st April he had met with 
 Mike Barton, GCC PROW and discussed Wildmoorway Lane and the difficulties in 
 working with Payback in the Community. On 6th May Cllr Stuart had a meeting 
 with the acting Commanding Officer, Adjutant and Sgt Matty Holford of the 
 Silver Stars at the barracks. The tandem jump had been agreed. The Silver Stars 
 needed to have an update on the agreed flying times for their drop aircraft. On 
 20th May Cllr Stuart will meet the new surveyor from Aggregate Industries. The 
 Play Rangers were pleased with the initial response to their initiative on the 
 Upper Up playing fields. On the first day 12 youngsters took part. This had 
 doubled to 24 by week three. Helen Jones GCC Youth Services had explained that 
 the mobile skate boards had not been available for the opening of facilities at 
 Upper Up as the equipment, originally supplied by Park Leisure Ltd, had been 
 condemned as unfit for use as it was dangerous. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart continued that it should be recorded since our 
 last Parish Council meeting the Cricket Club building had been subjected to an 
 arson attack. The front door had been smashed off its hinges and it seems that 
 whoever did the damage used the rail from the veranda as a battering ram as the 
 door frame had been split and all three security locks had been pushed out. The 
 fire had been started in a waste bin used to store the goal nets for the youth 
 football teams and the resulting fire has damaged the partition wall between 
 the hail and kitchen area. The actual structural damage was limited due to the 
 very prompt arrival of three fire engines and the flames were extinguished 
 quickly. However, the smoke damage is extensive and the entire interior needs 
 attention. Work has commenced on the chemical cleaning of the interior Monday 
 11th May and that will take some time to complete. Then the repairs will be 
 carried out all by contractors employed by Norwich Union Insurance. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the day of the fire 17th April I had been to the field 
 mid afternoon and noticed that there were many young people all over the area 
 due to it being school holidays. The actual attack happened late afternoon and 
 an adult phoned the emergency services but claims to have not seen anyone 
 actually damaging the building. Despite the fact that the field was crowded 
 about an hour previously, by the time the police arrived, soon after the fire 
 service, there was hardly anyone there. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It would be good to hear what investigations if any have 
 been made by the police. There must have been at least three police vehicles 
 present at the incident with five or more uniformed officers. Perhaps we expect 
 too much in hoping that we will ever be kept informed by the police. We will 
 raise these questions at the Annual Meeting next week. </p>
