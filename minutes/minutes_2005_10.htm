 reported that he had very recently emailed Cllr Mrs Pollard additional points 
 for inclusion in the Village Plan. Cllr Mrs Pollard requested that all Parish 
 Councillors who had further subjects for insertion to email them to her 
 immediately. The presentation of the plan would be redesigned to give a 
 clearer, simpler layout of its objectives. A meeting of the Village Plan Sub 
 Committee was arranged for later in the month after which the plan would be 
 introduced to the Parish Council for approval.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">CLERK’S REPORT<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">On Saturday 17th 
 September I attended the official presentation of the Bledisloe Plate at the 
 Cross, South Cerney. Cllr Squire accepted the award from Sir John Adye KCMG, 
 Chairman of Gloucestershire CPRE Branch. Also present representing the Parish 
 Council were Cllr Harris, Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr Webb. Other members of the 
 presentation party attending were Professor Adrian Phillips and Finals Judge, 
 Richard Lloyd, Vice-Chairman of the Branch. On Wednesday 21st September I 
 attended the AGM of the SLCC which was held at Yate Town Council Offices. The 
 speakers included Hester Oxford from GCC giving a progress report on her 
 attempts to create a charter for Parish, Town, District and County Councils; 
 Mike Kennedy, National President of the SLCC and Judith Lang, South 
 Gloucestershire Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Over the past weekend I attended the annual Clerk’s Conference 
 at Stratford upon Avon returning home on Monday afternoon. The Conference was 
 opened by the retiring President Mike Kennedy at 2pm on Saturday 8th October. 
 He gave a short history of his year in office and the numerous places he had 
 visited including his meeting with the Gloucestershire branch of the SLCC. The 
 theme of the Conference was a “Cleaner, Safer, Greener Environment”. Peter 
 Parker from ODPM outlined the government’s plans to implement the objectives, 
 four of which South Cerney, in my opinion, has already achieved. In no 
 particular order the plan is to create attractive and welcoming parks; 
 improving the infrastructure; making places cleaner and maintaining them as 
 such; making places safer and tackling antisocial behaviour; engaging and 
 empowering local people and communities; catering for children and tackling 
 inequality. To achieve these objectives, grants should be streamlined, although 
 not specifically but on the general principle of cleaner, safer and greener. 
 The first afternoon workshop session I attended gave an in-depth description of 
 the purpose and management of community support officers (CSOs). Surprisingly, 
 in my view, CSOs have little powers and these are in the gift of the Chief 
 Constable to be awarded from a restricted menu of policing duties. For example, 
 a CSO only has the right to detain a suspect for a maximum of 30 minutes. On 
 the other hand because of the light training given to CSOs they cannot be used 
 as mainline Police Constables and are therefore less likely to be withdrawn 
 from post for other police duties. Some Chief Constables demand a fee from 
 local communities to assist with their deployment. The next workshop was opened 
 by John Arthur, Town Clerk of Peterlee who introduced Dee Bingham from ENCAMS 
 (Environment Campaigns Ltd) which was originally responsible for the Keep 
 Britain Tidy and Blue Flag Beaches campaigns. It was emphasised that it was not 
 a government department but a charitable trust which as well as advising 
 government also criticised it when thought necessary. Currently the most 
 obvious problems were fly-tipping and abandoned vehicles. Ms Bingham admitted 
 that ENCAMS operated predominantly in urban areas and the organisation was 
 urgently rethinking its rural strategy. Another workshop I visited debated 
 whether or not to scrap the Quality Parish Scheme. Although since its launch in 
 2003 only 200 of the 8000 parish councils had qualified so far, another 800 
 were in the pipeline. Defra was currently reviewing the scheme. Overall the 
 group at the session was in favour of its continuance.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">On Sunday morning I attended a lecture on the challenges of 
 working alone at home given by Bethan Osborne, Human Relations Advisor at SLCC. 
 It was very interesting but little of note to record except minor tax 
 advantages which seemed too complicated to take advantage to claim. Before the 
 lunch break I joined colleagues debating “This conference believes higher 
 precepts support progressive local councils delivering independent community 
 services, appropriate to the needs of a satisfied electorate”. It was a lively 
 and humourous debate which conference overwhelmingly supported. After lunch the 
 AGM accepted the report and accounts for the previous year, elected a new 
 president and conducted other<font size="1"> </font>SLCC business. The last 
 workshop I attended on Sunday described the concept of living streets and how 
 to achieve this in conjunction with traffic and other road users. Plenty of 
 slides showed how obesity has relentlessly increased in western society through 
 lack of exercise, reliance on car transport and diet. Action was needed to 
 change attitudes and persuade us all to leave the car at home especially on 
 shorter journeys. WOW (Walk on Wednesday) was a current campaign.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">The first session on Monday morning was conducted by the Chief 
 Executive of the SLCC, Nick Randle. Its theme was the Professional Clerk and 
 Community Governance. He explained how policy is shaping our sector and the 
 changes taking place which was affecting the role of the Clerk. By its nature 
 the role of the Clerk is mostly unseen and the Society will be running a 
 campaign in the next few months to bring this role more publicity by 
 encouraging local newspapers to enlighten communities. He reaffirmed the 
 attributes needed to be a clerk and welcomed the new terms and conditions 
 agreed with NALC. Training and continuous development were necessary to enhance 
 the Clerk’s performance and a benchmark qualification CiCLA should be sought as 
 entry to the sector. Following on was a workshop conducted by Andrew Osborne (Defra 
 – Local Environment Quality Team member) on the Clean Neighbourhoods and 
 Environment Act 2005 which had been introduced in the House of Commons on 7th 
 December 2004 and received Royal Assent on 7th April 2005. This will give 
 Parish Councils the power to issue FPNs (Fixed Penalty Notice) for litter, 
 graffiti, fly posting and dog offences. It will also allow Parish Councils to 
 introduce dog control orders for a range of offences. There will be no new 
 funding available for its introduction and it will be a power and not a duty. 
 Enforcement is only part of the answer and eduction, campaigning, communicating 
 and partnerships must be also used. Parish Council powers come into force in 
 April 2006. If, for example a Dog Control Order was implemented it would 
 override any existing byelaw. Elected representatives would not be allowed to 
 issue FPNs and Clerks would have to attend a training program before any such 
 order could be issued. Fines would be set by the Primary Authority within the 
 range of £50–£85 although discounts would be available at the discretion of the 
 Parish Council regardless of the Primary Authority. If the collecting Council 
 has Quality status the fines can be used for any budgeted project otherwise 
 receipts can only be used in conjunction with the FPN.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">I left the conference at 11.30am and did not attend the final 
 session.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">During September I averaged 3 hours 36 minutes over the 22 
 available working days which is par for my contract.</p>

 Mrs Pollard that the Parish Council agrees to the inspection by Mr Hicks who 
 had quoted £300 plus VAT to include a risk assessment. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour.</p>

 the vicinity of Bow Wow. Cllr Jay reported that Ms Portlock was startled over 
 the condition of the bank erosion and would consider the situation. She would 
 also take advice on the options necessary to keep the river clear of weed. Cllr 
 Jay suggested to her that members of the Unpaid Works Unit might be used as the

 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">On Saturday and 
 Sunday of last week members of the Unpaid Works Unit had lifted the tiles at 
 Upper Up and Cerney Wick. Cllr Caunce was especially impressed with the 
 conscientious and diligent behaviour of the people involved and the Committee 
 agreed with him when he suggested that the Clerk write and thank the National 
 Probation Service for their fine efforts. The Clerk was also asked to thank 
 Helen Dorling of South Cerney Riding School in Cerney Wick for her donation to 
 the Parish Council which she hoped would be used for the benefit of the youth 
 of the community. Cllr Stuart reported that all the tiles had now been recycled 
 locally and the Clerk was asked to thank Hills for their generous offer to 
 accept them as waste which had not been necessary.</p>

 that the safety tiles had been uplifted over the weekend of 8th and 9th October 
 and the swings padlocked to prevent their use. The cycle mounds were being used 
 by a considerable number of people. The Young Offenders group under the 
 supervision of the National Probation Service had painted the concrete posts 
 and treated the timber fencing with wood preservative at no cost to the Parish 
 Council. Cllr Stuart reported an incident in the vicinity of the CCTV camera at 
 Upper Up which convinced him that some local youths no longer treated the 
 installation as a deterrent to their anti social behaviour. The Clerk was to 
 enquire from Les Haines (CDC) if there was a record available of when the 
 camera was in operation.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to inform Ali Swainston at Cotswold 
 Water Park Society that the bridle path from the Spine Road to the bridge over 
 the river Thames was over growing and needed attention.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Harris suggested that a tender should be sent out for 
 quotes to remove the tower slide from the Robert Franklin Way play area, remove 
 the safety tiles, fill in resultant space with top soil, seed the area and 
 leave the site clean and tidy. The Committee agreed with Cllr Stuart who argued 
 that the equipment should be offered to GPFA in the first instance. Cllr Stuart 
 added that the Unpaid Works Unit would be prepared to dismantle and re-erect 
 the slide at another location.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Mrs Chubb was concerned with the remains left in the ditch 
 after its recent strimming. Cllr Harris agreed to inspect and report back to 
 the Parish Council.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Jay had been asked by the Cricket Club if the Parish 
 Council would grant permission for it to erect a chain link fence to provide a 
 cricket net practice area to coach youngsters. The bowling surface would be a 
 roll up removable mat on a concrete base and the run up on recycled rubber 
 safety tiles. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that 
 the Parish Council be minded to approve the continuation of the project. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart reported that he had been contacted by Gordon 
 Stratford from South Cerney Football Club who informed him that the goal posts 
 were now illegal and needed to be replaced. To ensure grant funding the 
 football club needed to prove that they were in possession of a lease for the 
 ground. The Parish Council agreed that it was improbable that any such lease 
 existed but thought that a lease based on the one agreed to with the Cricket 
 Club would be a good basis on which to start. Cllr Nicholas warned that the 
 Football Club should carefully check the criteria of such a lease.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart further reported that GCC PROW was dealing with the 
 legalities concerned in the creation of the footpath from Upper Up to Keynes 
 Park.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart also reported that Mike Barton GCC PROW was hoping 
 to arrange a meeting with Ben Knight to discuss the creation of the cycle path 
 along the old canal from South Cerney to Siddington.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart finally reported in order that GCC PROW might adopt 
 the steps from Bow Wow to BSC1 as a public right of way it was necessary to 
 obtain 20 signed declarations from residents who had used the steps over 20 
 years.</p>

 informed him that the District Council would be deciding on its Councillors’

 His office was preparing a standard claim form which would be circulated.</p>

 The Committee agreed with Cllr Jay who had suggested that the 
 Village Hall Running Costs would be better analysed by allocating £300.00 of the April 
 spend to the Village Hall Capital Project Grant. Similarly the £723.92 spent in September on 
 recarpeting the Committee Room should be allocated to the Village Hall Capital Project Grant 
 and not the Village Hall Running Costs. Web costs were extracted from the office 
 expenses and allocated to professional fees. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Smith 
 who suggested that a separate budget category be created for IT purposes in next year’s 
 budget.</p>

 Applicant: Lake Ten Developments Ltd, c/o DPDS Consulting

 Erection of forty (40) semi-detached holiday lodges, use of

 highway and drainage infrastructure; location for replacement clubhouse; part 
 infilling of lake; landscaping and open space; closure of existing access and construction of new 
 access (revised scheme) at Lake 10,Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney (R)<br>
 The Committee considered that the traffic assessment is 
 fundamentally flawed as appraisal is 5 years out of date. See Chapter 8 of Planning Environmental 
 Appraisal. It ignores the fact that permission has since been given for 50 (fifty) dwellings 
 on neighbouring Lake 11. If permission is granted the Parish Council requests:<br>
 1. The entrance is moved either back to the south east corner 
 of site or north west along the lane towards the Spine Road to increase visibility for traffic 
 exiting/entering the site; 2. The whole junction of Cerney Wick Lane and B4696 (Spine Road) is 
 redesigned to accept the inevitable traffic increase; 3. Homes are designated as holiday 
 homes and include the common condition that they remain empty during the month of 
 February; 4. Wheel wash is mandatory for all vehicles exiting the site during construction 
 phase.<br>

 hereby permitted shall be used to provide holiday accommodation only, which shall not be 
 occupied as permanent, unrestricted accommodation or as a primary place of residence, 
 and the said accommodation shall not be occupied for two periods of two weeks between 
 October and March in each calendar year. Reason: The site is not suitable for permanent,

 location. This condition is imposed in the light of PPS7 and PPG21, Policies 2 and 38 of 
 the Cotswold District Local Plan and emerging Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 21, 28 
 and UT1. 3. The use of the development hereby permitted shall be solely ancillary to the 
 use of the lake for recreational fishing purposes as previously authorised under planning 
 permission Local Planning Authority ref CT.4073/D, dated 19th February 2003. Reason: 
 Unrestricted holiday accommodation at this location would be detrimental to the

 shall not start before the finish for the external woodwork has been approved in writing 
 by the Local Planning Authority. The external woodwork shall be finished and 
 thereafter maintained in the approved colour. Reason: To ensure that, in accordance with 
 Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 2, 40 and Water Park Policy 8.1, emerging Cotswold 
 District Local Plan Revised Deposit Policies 21, 48 and UT1, PPS1 and PPS7, the development 
 will safeguard the character of the site and its wider setting. It is important to 
 protect and maintain the character and appearance of the area in which this development 
 is located. The colour of the finish of the external woodwork will have a significant effect 
 on the appearance of the proposed development.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">AIRFIELD LIAISON INAUGURAL MEETING<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart volunteered to attend the meeting on 
 Tuesday 18th October at Duke of Gloucester Barracks. Cllr Nicholas suggested that any 
 statement made included “further private and/or recreational use (or quasi recreational 
 use) of the South Cerney airfield should avoid intensification of the current levels of 
 aircraft noise”. Cllr Bennett informed Parish Councillors that the Cotswold District Council 
 had not empowered the meeting but that he and Cllr Mrs Clark would attend.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart then read a statement which he would, with Parish 
 Council approval, make to the meeting on 18th October. “For many years, South Cerney Parish 
 Council has been subjected to a sustained stream of complaints about and demands that we 
 use our influence to stop the weekend flying from Duke of Gloucester Barracks. In particular, 
 the complaints have been aimed at what some consider to be a mainly commercial activity 
 taking place from a government establishment.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Our Parish Council represents over 3,200 people and we have 
 seen that the complaints come from a very small number of these. In fact, we have really only 
 had regular complaints from two people one of whom only resides here on an irregular basis. 
 We have also received occasional requests from maybe seven or eight other people 
 including an owner of a lodge on the water park.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">As Councillors, we have spoken to numerous inhabitants of the 
 Parish regarding the flying from the airfield and the greater majority are fully in favour 
 of the activities continuing. Furthermore, our Council has considered and debated the 
 question of the flying and have on several occasions unanimously voted that we totally support the 
 continued flying from the airfield. We notified the two main complainants of that fact 
 and also told them that we considered the matter to be closed.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">We were dismayed when we were informed that Mr Brassington, the 
 CDC Environmental Health Officer was setting up this Liaison Group without his 
 first having discussed the situation with local councillors including ourselves. If we had 
 been consulted, we would have strongly argued against its formation as we consider that 
 the low level of complaint is such that it does not warrant such a time consuming exercise. 
 All that this Liaison Group will do is to resurrect the enthusiasm of the complainants and 
 no doubt we will all be receiving a new crop of letters and phone calls from them in 
 the immediate future. This is surely a case of a vociferous minority wearing down the resolve 
 of the local council. South Cerney Parish Council would prefer that this proposed Liaison 
 Group should not be set up but will take an active role if it is agreed to continue with 
 its formation”.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Caunce that 
 the Parish Council agrees that Chairman Cllr Stuart makes the above statement to the 
 meeting on 18th October. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
