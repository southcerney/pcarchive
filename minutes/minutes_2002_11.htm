    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 13th NOVEMBER 2002</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart welcomed Lt. Col. Séan English Commanding
    Officer 29 Regt Royal Logistics Corps based at Duke of Gloucester Barracks, South Cerney
    to this private meeting of Parish Councillors. Three members of the public awaiting to
    attend the Parish Council meeting were also invited to remain. Lt. Col. English gave a
    brief synopsis of his career to date and his role now as Commanding Officer of his
    Regiment. Currently there were 317 serving members of which 17 were officers and the
    remaining non-commissioned soldiers were mostly above the rank of Private. Forty-five per
    cent of his personnel were deployed around the world and this added to his welfare duties
    in dealing with members' families. Morale was extremely high which was evidenced in the
    disciplinary record of less than one case in three months. Lt. Col. English actively
    encourages members of his regiment to interact with local residents and offered to help
    with village activities. The Duke of Gloucester Barracks is home to the Silver Stars free
    fall parachute display team, the Parascending Club, and activities from model car racing
    to amateur dramatics take place on the base. Since his arrival he has carried out a full
    review of all military air activity and stressed that no flying activity would take place
    on sensitive weekends if avoidable and it would be restricted to three weekends per month
    when appropriate. He agreed to publish a list of potential flying days on the airfield in
    the Cerney News. He hoped to invite representatives of the community to partake in social
    events at the Barracks twice a year. Cllr Stuart and Cllr Dunn asked that Capt. Ian
    Cheeseman be congratulated for the efforts he made in helping to organise the recent
    Jubilee celebrations held in the village. Parish Councillors were in agreement that the
    Remembrance Day parade by members of the Regiment was a credit to the Army. Cllr Mrs
    Spriggs remarked that although she was the nearest resident to the base on the Parish
    Council she had no problem with activity on the airfield. Cllr Nicholas said that it was
    much appreciated that Lt. Col. English was willing to be co-opted as a School Governor of
    Ann Edwards School. In conclusion Lt. Col. English thanked Parish Councillors for the
    invitation to attend the meeting and the opportunity to discuss the relevant issues. Lt.
    Col. English then left the meeting at 7.30pm.</p>

    The Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Gardiner, Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC)
    and Cllr Jones (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 9 OCTOBER 2002</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Dunn that the Minutes were a true
    and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by
    the Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    Matters arising would be debated at Committee stage and be discussed when the Chairmen of
    the Committees made their reports. The Clerk then reported on his actions over the
    previous month.<br>
    I contacted Barry Greenaway for an update on street lighting work. Twin street lights had
    been erected at the start of Bow Wow overhanging the brook. At the Station Road/High
    Street Junction, near the Limes, developers must complete their work and until they do so
    he is unable to do much. In Station Road lanterns but not the brackets had been replaced
    to redirect the lighting to the highway. He was trying to get the contractor to complete
    the other outstanding work.<br>
    I wrote to thank Mr G. Watson (CDC Enforcement Officer) for his reply concerning queries
    at Orchard House and urged him to prosecute those responsible if the lime tree should die.<br>
    Response forms were faxed to CDC Planning.<br>
    A submission was sent to the Appeal Inspector supporting CDC's refusal to grant planning
    permission to Westbury Homes. As it had not been possible to agree the text for the Parish
    Council¹s report on the appeal refusal in the Cerney News before the deadline it is on
    this month's agenda for deliberation.<br>
    All payments to suppliers were dispatched.<br>
    South Cerney Football Club had paid £10.94 for their use of water on the playing field.
    They had a credit of £1.41 from a previous payment deducted from the £12.35 demanded.<br>
    A risk assessment should include provision of adequate insurance cover, play area safety
    inspections, banking procedures, transfers from deposit to current account, Clerk's
    sickness or unavailability, Parish Council records and anything else which might disrupt
    the work of the Parish Council. T.D. Construction had verbally agreed to halve his quote
    to adjust the guard rails on the access ramp at Upper Up. An interim payment of £8,225
    had been made.<br>
    Kevin Richings, Thames Tree Services was instructed to cut down the dead cherry tree in
    Clarks Hay to below ground level but he should liaise with Cllr Gardiner for specific
    instructions.<br>
    A quotation for £469 (ex VAT) and specification for a 2m x 1m scramble type net had been
    received from Lappset. Hammond &amp; Taylor Superlift quoted £239.70 (inc VAT). A
    response from Tayplay (Perth) Scotland was awaited. Jeremy Simmons had been asked to strim
    the ditch in Station Road, attend to the nettles at Robert Franklin Way play area and to
    cut the area beyond the football and cricket pitches at Upper Up to a lower level.<br>
    Mr Bull had been advised of missing and damaged street signs.<br>
    I contacted Jason Bell Managing Director for the contractors responsible for the sub
    station at the Limes and he promised to secure the structure until the work was completed.
    John Offer design engineer at Westbury Homes had supplied the contact and would also talk
    to the contractors. Lt. Col English 29 Regt accepted an invitation to meet the Parish
    Council before the November meeting.<br>
    I wrote to the residents at Lakeside apropos rubbish dumping at the railway arches. One
    reply had been received.<br>
    Mr Jenkins of Watermark had replied concerning traffic speed in Wildmoorway Lane.<br>
    A list of the Parish Council's information schedule had been forwarded to the Information
    Commissioner.<br>
    I attended the annual conference of the SLCC in Harrogate on the 19/20/21 October.<br>
    On 6 November I accompanied Cllr Nicholas to Whitton Associates to witness the opening of
    tenders for the Upper Up park development.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT</strong><br>
    <br>
    The Clerk and members of the public were asked to leave the meeting while Parish
    Councillors discussed the deliberations of the Personnel Committee. The Clerk was asked to
    rejoin the meeting where he was informed that it had been agreed to promote him to Grade
    20.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 11
    November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    CT.8163/D<br>
    Cllr Gardiner, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart were concerned with the composition of the
    sample walling at Orchard House. Cllr Nicholas quoted from the Decision Notice permitting
    development and referred particularly to the following: Item 2 stated that the proposed
    wall shall be built of natural Cotswold rubble walling stone; Item 3 said that the
    development shall not start until a sample panel of walling at least one metre square
    showing the proposed coursing and finish has been erected on the site and subsequently
    approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and the walls shall be constructed
    only in the same way as the approved panel. The panel shall be retained on site until the
    completion of the walling; Item 5 reiterated that the development shall not start until
    samples of the proposed walling materials have been approved in writing by the Local
    Planning Authority and only the approved materials shall be used. Item 6 compounded that
    before work starts, the design and details of the walling shall be approved in writing by
    the Local Planning Authority. The design details shall be accompanied by drawings to a
    minimum scale of 1:5 with cross section profiles, elevations and sections. The works shall
    only be carried out in accordance with the approved details. The Clerk was asked to write
    to the case officer Mr Drake (CDC) that current samples of the wall on display were not in
    accordance with the granted Conditions. Local Plan<br>
    The Parish Council discussed what action should be taken in respect of the forthcoming
    draft Local Plan which was anticipated would be published towards the end of November.
    When published there would be a period of six weeks for receipt of representations. The
    time allowed for consultation would inevitably fall over the festive season which could
    restrict residents' input. It was decided to invite members of the community to an open
    meeting to be held in the Village Hall at 7.30pm on Thursday 2 January 2003. Their views
    would then be considered at the Parish Council Meeting the following Wednesday when the
    Parish Council would formulate its response.<br>

    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br>
    34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT.0006/3/H: Future of CAMAS site<br>
    &nbsp; A series of emails originating with Paul Fong (Hunter Page) trying to cultivate a
    meeting between CDC, the Parish Council and the developers to discuss the future of the
    site had been received. M. Kitchen (CDC) was not amenable to the idea. The Parish Council
    agreed with the Planning Committee that it was premature to meet with the developers. Cllr
    Nicholas suggested that an open meeting, to encourage as wide a debate as possible on the
    future of the site, should include input from interested organisations within the
    community. After a short debate it was agreed that the site be included for discussion at
    the open meeting planned for 2 January<br>
    49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDC ­ Use Classes re CAMAS site<br>
    &nbsp; In reply to a query as to what Use Classes were permitted for the CAMAS site M.
    Kitchen (CDC) referred to paragraph 7 of the Inspector¹s Report to the First Secretary of
    State as being sufficient to allow an informed debate about the future of the site.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PARISH COUNCIL REPORT IN CERNEY NEWS</strong><br>
    <br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the Clerk compose an article for publication in the Cerney
    News outlining the reasons which the Secretary of State gave for dismissing the appeal by
    Westbury Homes for the larger development on the CAMAS site and the Parish Council's
    submission, to another appeal, in support of the Cotswold District Council¹s refusal to
    grant permission to the smaller development of 30 houses on the same site. Residents would
    also be invited to attend a public meeting in the Village Hall on Thursday 2 January at
    7.30 to discuss the implications of the draft Local Plan which is due for publication
    shortly. Cllr Harris asked that the Free Phone number 0800 542 1890 for reporting public
    lighting problems also be published.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Due to the absence of Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of
    the Finance Committee which had met on 11 November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up Park Tenders</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas and the Clerk had attended a meeting held at Whitton Associates to open
    received tenders for the reduced scheme planned for the Upper Up park. Of the five tenders
    received James Harris Contracting was the most competitive. Cllr King had analysed the
    tenders, especially those from James Harris Contracting and Phoenix, for their viability
    as they were the most competitively priced. He determined that the Parish Council would
    attain more value from James Harris Contracting besides it being the lowest tender. Cllr
    Dunn expressed his reservations about using a member of the Parish Council for the
    contract and was concerned that residents might construe this choice as &quot;jobs for the
    boys&quot;. Cllr Mrs Spriggs was also concerned as to how the public might react to his
    appointment. Cllr Mrs Chubb argued that as the tendering process had been independent and
    properly researched it was right and proper to accept the lowest quote regardless of
    public opinion. Cllr Stuart added that, no matter how transparent the procedure was,
    people will criticise the decision. Cllr Harris who had been unavoidably delayed entered
    the Committee Room and was asked to wait outside until the debate finished. After further
    discussions it was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pearse to accept the
    tender from James Harris Contracting. The Parish Council voted five (5) in favour, one (1)
    against and two (2) abstentions. The motion was therefore carried. Cllr Harris was then
    asked to rejoin the meeting. The Clerk was asked to inform Whitton Associates of the
    decision of the Parish Council and to ask them for (a) precise definition of the
    contingency; (b) whether the contractor had Public Liability insurance; (c) if there was a
    clause to determine the timing; (d) if there was an overrun penalty; (e) a latest start
    date and (f) the certainty that the development, when completed, could be insured.<br>
    <strong>Response from Audit Commission</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that no reply had been received.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 11 November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris asked that the Clerk enquire from Mr Greenaway if it was intended to erect a
    further light near the footbridge down Bow Wow. Upper Up Tower Slide Scramble Net
    Quotations had been received from Wicksteed Leisure, Lappset and Hammond Taylor. Of the
    suppliers contacted all proved unwilling to rectify another suppliers' apparatus. The
    Clerk was asked to contact GPFA to recommend a suitable contractor who would be willing to
    attach the net to the slide at Upper Up.<br>
    <strong>Ramp at Upper Up</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to enquire from TD Construction when he intended to complete the
    project.<br>
    <strong>Willow Trees</strong><br>
    It was agreed that as Cllr Harris had informed Mr G. Watson (CDC) no further action was
    necessary at this time. Members of the Committee would carry out an inventory of trees for
    which the Parish Council was responsible over the winter period.<br>
    <strong>Station Road Ditch</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb had complained that the contractors had not made a very good job of
    strimming the ditch in Station Road. Cllr Harris had investigated and explained, in his
    opinion, that as the ditch was a natural habitat the sides had been trimmed adequately.<br>
    <strong>Trees on the Piece</strong><br>
    Only one quote had been received for this project. Cllr King had been in contact with Tim
    Bendle who had refused to give a quotation as he considered that the specification was
    fallacious. Cllr Harris, who had originated the specification, explained how time
    consuming he found the procedure and countered that if Mr Bendle had contacted him he
    would have clarified any query concerning the quote. It was agreed that the Committee
    produce a more detailed specification at their meeting next month.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Car Park</strong><br>
    The Clerk was to ask Phoenix to complete top dressing of the Upper Up car park and to ask
    the contractor to quote for the installation of a &quot;sleeping policeman&quot; at the
    entrance. Cllr Harris would furnish the Clerk with a drawing and measurements for a
    dividing fence to facilitate parking although it was decided to monitor car parking over
    the coming months to see if a fence was necessary.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the car park surface at Upper Up was showing signs of wear and
    the holes needed to be filled. At the Robert Franklin Way play area he described the swing
    as &quot;extremely sad&quot; with nettles growing up through the safety surface. At Cerney
    Wick the fence had finally been repaired and dead elms in the hedge on Church Lane
    removed. He was concerned that the safety tiles were very slippery beneath the climbing
    frame and asked the Clerk to research a good treatment for removing the algae slime on the
    tiles. The rubbish bin in the play area had not been emptied for some time. Cllr Gardiner
    would carry out the next round of inspections.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TRAFFIC SPEED THROUGH THE VILLAGE</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Nicholas remarked that there was money in the budget to provide for road safety. Cllr
    King was critical of traffic speed especially in Broadway Lane. At every entrance road to
    the village larger weight limit signs were needed. Cllr Mrs Spriggs remarked that she had
    occasionally to redirect lost drivers of heavy goods vehicles who had entered the village.
    In a written submission the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner suggested that pinch points
    throughout the village, especially on its four entrances, should be considered. The Clerk
    was asked to invite a representative from Glos County Highways, the Cotswold District
    Council and the Police to attend a meeting with the Parish Council.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllrs Dunn, Cllr Harris, Cllr King and Cllr Stuart will meet with Cllr Gardiner on 23
    November at 10.30am to plant the remaining four bags of daffodil bulbs.<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that a car was occasionally being parked on the public open space in
    front of the Limes and asked the Clerk to notify the owner to desist.<br>
    Cllr Stuart had had complaints that cars were parking on the verge of the corner of Clarks
    Hay and Station Road and asked the Clerk to notify the owners to desist.<br>
    Cllr Stuart had asked car owners not to park at the entrance to the Langet opposite the
    new disabled ramp to Upper Up playing fields. At first they complied but have now reverted
    to their old habits. The Clerk reported the miscreants to PC G. Lager who had replied that
    he would do his best. He explained that &quot;'a likely offence would be causing an
    unnecessary obstruction' which sounds easy but the legislators have moved the goal posts
    which makes it more difficult for the Police to proceed because each offence needs a
    complainant i.e. the name of someone who has been inconvenienced.&quot;<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pearse asked that the residents of Huxley Court be asked not to dump rubbish in
    its vicinity. The Clerk will notify the occupants of the four properties concerned.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the hedges on the western side of the lane near the disused
    railway bridge in Cerney Wick were overgrown. Cllr Harris informed the Parish Council that
    the hedges were the responsibility of the Cotswold Water Park Society.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the drain which runs from Green Acres to Oklahoma in Cerney
    Wick needed to be cleared. The Clerk would inform Mr S. Taffinder landowner of the
    majority of the adjacent property that he was responsible for its clearance.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 10.50pm. </td>
