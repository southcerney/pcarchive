    The Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner opened the meeting at 7.30 pm and welcomed the assembled
    Councillors to their penultimate meeting<p><strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Harris and Cllr Jones (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 12 FEBRUARY 2003</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pearse had been omitted from the list of attending councillors. The Clerk
    apologised and would amend the record accordingly. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and
    seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Minutes were a true and accurate record. The Parish
    Council was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>GOLF BALLS</strong><br>
    Mr Franklin, Manager South Cerney Golf Course explained that the footpath where the lost
    golf balls were found was the property of the Golf Course. Warning signs had been erected
    at the footpath entrance and also on the first tee to alert golfers. Cllr Spriggs brought
    a bucket of 90 golf balls to the meeting she had collected as proof that the menace
    existed. Cllr Spriggs stated that users of the path were nervous that inevitably someone
    would be hit. Cllr Mrs Pearse had walked the footpath and not found any stray golf balls
    and Cllr Mrs Gardiner had found four. Cllr Nicholas said that Mr Franklin should agree
    that the number of balls landing on the footpath was significant. Cllr Dunn said it was up
    to users of the footpath and the Golf Course to use common sense and to be aware of the
    potential danger. Mr Franklin said that the Course Rules now informed players that the
    canal and footpath were out of bounds which should persuade golfers to be more careful and
    he would also place a further warning notice on the second tee. Mr Franklin said that
    players on the first two holes will be directed not to tee off when they can see footpath
    users who were in a position putting them at risk to a mis-hit shot. Before leaving the
    meeting Mr Franklin spoke of his concern to the damage being done to the supports of the
    old railway bridge on Bow Wow Lane. The Clerk would inform the relevant responsible
    authority. The Chairperson thanked Mr Franklin for attending the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    Planning response forms were faxed to CDC Planning. All payments to suppliers were
    dispatched. Copies of letters written to Mrs J. Squire (Cerney News), Mike James (Cricket
    Club), R. Shaw (Elmhurst), D. P. Bennett (Oakleaze), J. Whittaker (Area Traffic Manager
    Cotswolds) and Ms Cooksley were passed to the Chairperson Cllr Mrs J. Gardiner for her
    information. The comments on the Local Plan were emailed to 10 Parish Councillors and a
    hard copy passed to Cllr Mrs Spriggs. An abbreviated version of the contents was also
    published in Cerney News along with an appeal for a Village<br>
    <strong>Projects Grants Co-Ordinator</strong>.<br>
    On Friday 21 February I attended a meeting with D. Taylor, Mrs J. Roberts, Mr Roberts and
    15th Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon at the Upper Up ramp. From a demonstration by Mrs
    Roberts it was obvious that the ramp in its present configuration is incapable of use by
    electrically driven wheelchairs. Mrs Roberts and the Marquis agreed with Mr Taylor's
    suggestion that the inner dividing wall be shortened by two metres to increase the width
    of the landing area which should also be made level. The width of the access at the bottom
    of the ramp would have to be enlarged. Mr Taylor calculated that the retaining wall at the
    bank side be increased in length to 14 ft which would allow space for entry of wheelchairs
    after he installed the safety barriers. The Parish Council will now have to decide if it
    is prepared to make these alterations.<br>
    Mrs Roberts agreed to carry out a survey of how local footpaths catered for disabled users
    on behalf of the Parish Council.<br>
    Since the Committee meetings held last Monday I have been in contact with Dan Goddard CDC
    Building Regulations who informed me that the access structure was exempt from building
    regulations as it is not attached to a building. The Disability Discrimination Act which
    comes into force in 2004 is a civil act which would require individual action. He told me
    to contact the Centre for Accessible Environment for further information. They pointed out
    that the platform at the apex of the 'V' should have a turning circle of at least 1.5m.
    Interestingly, under the Code of Practice if another entrance was available which provided
    reasonable alternative access, and was clearly signed as such, that would suffice if it
    was safe and did not violate the dignity of disabled users.<br>
    I also met Mr Timbrell and agreed where the sleeping policeman should be placed at the
    entrance to the car park. Mr Taylor recommended that the ramp be no more than 4 inches
    high leading to a flat area of approximately 1 ft wide and a gap left at each end to allow
    surface water to drain off the car park. Mr Timbrell informed me that the new design would
    cost £50 more than his quotation allowed. On behalf of the Parish Council I agreed to
    this as the increase would still make his final price less than any of the other
    quotations received.<br>
    On Tuesday 25 March I attended a meeting with Cllr King and Cllr Nicholas to discuss how
    to fund the Robert Franklin Way play equipment project. I agreed to a suggestion that I
    manage the necessary grant funding for this project. It was further agreed that I keep a
    record of the time spent at this task and all Parish Council work and if appropriate the
    Parish Council should consider increasing my contracted hours. To date I have made an
    application to the Countryside Agency for a Community Services Grant which has been
    acknowledged. I have also enquired from two other sources so far without reply.<br>
    On Wednesday 5 March I attended a meeting of the SLCC in Newent which discussed matters of
    common interest. I was able to inform one Clerk of my experience with GCC when the Parish
    Council purchased Robert Franklin Way playing field.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT AND SALARY AWARD</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner was of the opinion that the salary award for the period April 2003-March
    2004 had been agreed when the Personnel Committee last met. Cllr Mrs Gardiner would check
    her records and report her findings at the Parish Council meeting in April.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up Access Ramp</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to contact D. Taylor (GCC Highways) about the possibility of putting a
    new footpath in from the end of the ramp to the entrance of the car park. Cllr Mrs Pearse
    volunteered to ask Mrs D.Tresadern to test the ramp in her wheelchair and report her
    findings to the Parish Council. The Clerk reported on his meeting with Mrs Roberts, 15th
    Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon and D. Taylor (GCC Highways) where it was demonstrated
    that the access was unsuitable for powered wheelchairs. See Clerk's Report.<br>
    A discussion ensued on how to resolve the situation. Finally it was decided that the Clerk
    enquire from D. Taylor if GCC Highways would consider building a footpath on the western
    side of Upper Up to enable access from the pedestrian access to the car park.<br>
    <strong>Road Safety Improvements</strong><br>
    No reply had been received from Mr Whittaker or Mr Handley.<br>
    <strong>Blocked Surface Water Drain on Cirencester Road</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that one of the four drains on Cirencester Road near to the Talland
    Riding School was still blocked and asked the Clerk to inform D. Taylor GCC Highways.<br>
    <strong>Rubbish Bin Exteriors</strong><br>
    The Clerk informed Mike Weir (CDC) that the plastic outer sleeves of the rubbish bins at
    the Preaching Cross and at the end of Bow Wow by Lower Mill were missing.<br>
    <strong>Manhole Cover</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported the damaged BT manhole cover outside Gable Cottage in Silver Street.
    Progress enquiries should be made to 0800 216 927 quoting Fault Ref SS8QRF83.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 10
    March.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    CT.8163/D<br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform CDC Environmental Health and Safety department that
    residents were concerned with the safety of the wall at Orchard House, Upper Up because of
    its excessive height and the fact that it immediately joins the footpath. The Clerk was
    asked to ascertain from the Enforcement Officer what time scale had been allowed for
    either its alteration or a new application for permission.<br>
    <br>

    for the residential redevelopment of CAMAS site to provide 30 dwellings under application
    CT.0006/3/J Cllr Mrs Spriggs suggested that a Parish Council representative attend the

    At the Committee meeting Mr P. Jay had pointed out inaccuracies in the key of Figure 67
    where it illustrated protected open spaces in the Bow Wow area. On the map showing the
    cycle path between South Cerney and Siddington the text and map differed. Mr Jay was of
    the opinion that the development of cycle paths should be for the benefit of useful users,
    for example people using them to go to work or for school children on their way to school
    or college. The development for leisure purposes should be a secondary consideration.<br>
    29.&amp;30. CDC &amp; GCC ­ Mineral extraction conditions on CAMAS site<br>

    details for future possible use.<br>

    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart read Cllr Harris' inspection report in his absence. At Upper Up the chainwork
    of the basketball board was in need of repair. At Robert Franklin Way the play bark levels
    were low and needed topping up. The concrete seat is damaged and should be replaced. At
    Cerney Wick the seats on the swings had not yet been replaced and the play surface was
    slippery. The safety surface underneath the climbing frame was extremely dangerous. The
    Clerk was asked to purchase a suitable patio cleaner to remove the deposit on the safety
    surfaces. Cllr Gardiner will carry out the next round of inspections.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TREE SURVEY</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart carried out the tree survey on 12 January. Cllr Stuart
    presented a work schedule and a quotation for its implementation to the Parish Council
    based on a priority rating of 1-5. Cllr Harris had written to the Parish Council that he
    had spare trees to plant on the bank at the Piece. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner
    and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council agrees to implementing priorities 1
    and 2 quoted at £65 and £90 respectively. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
