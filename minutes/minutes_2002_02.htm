    <strong>Planning Permission refused by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.0006/3/D<br>
    Redevelopment of CAMAS site for residential purposes and the erection of a new community
    sports hall at Camas Building Materials Ltd, Station Road, South Cerney, Cirencester,
    Glos. CDC refused permission because the application was significantly contrary to the
    current approved Local Plan and to the emerging strategy for its review. Vigorous debate
    followed Cllr Nicholas' outlining of the history and reporting on the meeting members of
    the Parish Council had with Mr M. Kitchen (CDC). Cllr Nicholas commented that the Parish
    Council originally had No Objection to the application but that this response was not
    positive support for the development. The appeal inquiry would be held on 25 June after
    which the Secretary of State would determine the outcome. Cllr Mrs Spriggs pointed out
    that the proposed 150 new homes would irrevocably change the village and were not needed
    in the Parish. She referred to the Village Appraisal to support her argument. Cllr Mrs
    Spriggs estimated that the new development if passed would increase the number of houses
    in the village by 20% in 18 months. Cllr Mrs Gardiner refuted Cllr Mrs Spriggs assertion
    that the Parish Council was perceived to be begging for the new houses. Cllr Harris
    perspicaciously noted that piecemeal development would afford no &quot;planning gain&quot;
    at all and questioned what would happen to the land if it was not given permission for
    residential development as South Cerney had 95% of the industrial land bank in the South
    Cotswold area according to Mr M. Kitchen (CDC). Cllr Jones (CDC) pointed out that there
    were restrictions to development in the Structure Plan for the area but it was difficult
    to forecast beyond the Local Plan timescale. Cllr Stuart said it was a dilemma that if the
    appeal was not in favour of the application and Westbury Homes succeeded in piecemeal
    development the Parish would lose out on any possible planning gain. He referred to the
    situation experienced in Lechlade as an example of a large development which had provided
    substantial gain to the town. Cllr Mrs Gardiner, who said that she had lived in South
    Cerney since 1961, had seen it develop to the progressive village it was today and hoped
    it would continue to do so. Houses, she pointed out, were more preferable on the site than
    industrial development. Moreover, it would be detrimental to the village if the site was
    eventually developed in dribs and drabs. Cllr Stuart agreed with Cllr Mrs Gardiner that it
    was inevitable that some sort of development would take place. Cllr King suggested that
    the debate be opened to local residents at a public meeting. It was agreed by the Parish
    Council that the Clerk would arrange to organise the meeting on 28 February to be followed
    with a Parish Council meeting on 1 March to determine its response to the appeal.<br>
    <br>
    CT.4528/H<br>
    Erection of a dwelling at the site of a derelict lock cottage at Wildmoor Lock Cottage,
    South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>

    <strong>Traffic Calming in Broadway Lane</strong><br>
    An industrial developer had offered to pay for some sort of traffic calming gateway
    feature in Broadway Lane. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) undertook to ensure that the Parish Council
    would get an opportunity to comment its final details.<br>

    £1,921.97<br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner inspected and agreed the Clerk¹s travel expenses for January.<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council
    agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    The Committee considered that an account received for payment from the District Audit for
    fees of £486 based on 18 hours at £27 per hour plus VAT was excessive and asked the
    Clerk to express its surprise to the District Audit and request them to justify the time
    taken to perform the audit. It was decided to withhold payment until a reply from the
    District Audit was forthcoming. The Parish Council was in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Precept</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas was concerned as to which Act specifically enabled the Parish Council to
    precept for the work planned at Upper Up. GRCC had informed the Clerk that the Local
    Government Miscellaneous Provision Act 1976 granted this authority and included
    Recreational Facilities in a list in Section 19.<br>
    The Clerk had been unable to obtain a copy of the Act but Cllr Nicholas would endeavour to
    do so.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ground Maintenance Tender Analysis</strong><br>
    The tender returns for ground maintenance had been analysed from Cotswold Estate Services,
    D. Chubb, R. O. W. Berry, Jeremy Simmons Landscapes and R. Gardiner. Although Jeremy
    Simmons Landscapes was 4.5% more expensive overall than Cotswold Estate Services it was
    considered that the efforts made in the previous year by the contractor contributed to the
    Best Kept Village award. It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Stuart that
    the Parish Council agrees to employ Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd for grass cutting in
    South Cerney. The Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr Mrs Chubb who declared an
    interest, agreed. It was proposed by Cllr King and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the
    contract for ground maintenance in Cerney Wick be awarded to R. Gardiner as it was the
    lowest quotation received. The Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr Mrs Gardiner and
    Cllr Gardiner who declared an interest, agreed.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>Bus Shelter Repair</strong><br>
    The Committee thanked Cllr Gardiner for the help he had given Clive Symcox with the repair
    to the bus shelter. It was agreed that the shelter needed to be decorated and the Clerk

    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported on her playground inspections. At Upper Up play area the safety
    tiles were coming apart. The basketball board needed repainting. A rail had been broken in
    the fence surrounding the car park. The car park was badly pot-holed. At Robert Franklin
    Way the bark needed to be replaced. The play surface in the football goal area was mucky.
    There was a lot of litter on both sites. At Cerney Wick one swing had small holes in the
    seat and the wooden seat was green and slimy. The play surface at the climbing frame and
    swings was slippery. The fence was broken on the north side of the play area. There was
    some litter about. Cllr Harris will carry out the inspections in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MILLENNIUM REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had spoken with Lesley Sproat from the Environment Agency regarding the water
    voles but she advised that a planning application for the project should now be made with
    the proviso that work on the project should not commence until a vole survey had taken
    place. Cllr Harris had instructed Martin Portus accordingly who informed him that tender
    prices should be available by mid-March. Cllr Stuart agreed he would attend a meeting of
    the sub-committee when firm quotations had been received.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ground Maintenance Quotes</strong><br>
    The Committee concurred with the deliberations of the Finance Committee. The Parish
    Council was all in favour and the Clerk instructed to inform the successful contractors.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Overgrowing hedge on the Piece</strong><br>

    He had prepared a specification for the work needed with a proviso that it be undertaken
    before 1 April so as not to disturb nesting birds. The Clerk was asked to contact suitable
    contractors.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Golden Jubilee</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting held on 31 January with Capt Cheeseman, Cllr Dunn and
    Mrs A. Stuart. Capt Cheeseman informed the group that the airfield would be unavailable

    bonfire near to the site of the Millennium Park and that the Army would provide a spit
    roast and bar facilities but no decisions had yet been taken.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ditch in Station Road</strong><br>
    Mr D. Taylor of GCC Highways informed that Clerk that bank slippage might occur near the
    two outflow pipes as a result of the ditch clearing undertaken by the Parish Council. He
    advised that half a ton of 3-inch shingle be deposited to act as a baffle to the water
    flow. Cllrs Gardiner and Harris had inspected the ditch and found that material was only
    necessary in the area of the grille. The Clerk was asked to obtain quotes for this work.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>No Cycling Signs</strong><br>

    <br>
    <strong>Blocked Drains</strong><br>

    Lennards was causing flooding of the carriageway. The Clerk was asked to inform D. Taylor,
    GCC Highways.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cycle Racks</strong><br>
    Cotswold Water Park has asked the Parish Council to nominate suitable sites in the village
    to locate cycle racks. These racks are of a distinctive design based on a traditional
    metal &quot;park railing&quot; with a cycle embodied within it to show it is a cycle rack.
    The Parish Council agreed that the racks could be located at each of the three play areas,
    outside the Village Hall by the saddle stones, at the end of Church Lane near the gate to
    the allotments, at the bus shelter and the Laurels. Cllr Mrs Pearse was to ask the Vicar
    if he would consider a cycle rack to be placed inside the churchyard.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Notification of Tree Work</strong><br>
    The Parish Council had no objection to the proposed tree work at Farthings, Silver Street.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CODE OF CONDUCT</strong><br>

    Councillors. The Clerk was asked to make copies and distribute them to each Councillor.
    James Ellis, CDC Monitoring Officer would be notifying the Parish Council shortly of a
    roadshow he intended to hold to disseminate further information regarding the Code. The
    Parish Council is obliged to adopt a Local Code of Conduct by 5 May 2002. The Clerk was
    asked to put this item on next month's agenda.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FLOOD REPORT</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported on a Flood Prevention meeting she attended on 18 January. The
    Environment Agency had resolved four initial problems regarding river Churn strategy.
    Local landowners would be contacted regarding water storage up stream of Siddington and
    South Cerney which was predicted to have in place by 2004-05 but compulsory purchase
    orders would be needed and this could cause some delay. Thames Water had checked all the
    monitoring systems and reported that the two in South Cerney were being operated correctly
    under normal conditions. All six pumping stations appeared to be working correctly. The
    studies had been carried out in extremely dry conditions. Thames Water had undertaken to
    clean the whole system. Due to the absence of a representative Fosseway Housing submitted
    a written report informing the meeting that all the work in the drainage system was now
    completed. Fosseway Housing required isolating valves but this has been delayed as a
    special licence is necessary which Thames Water would arrange.<br>
