    <br>
    <b>CHAIRMAN’S REPORT</b><br>
    <br>
    A couple of weeks ago we had the first election of parish councillors for 
    some 12 years. Most times we have had to beg or even bully people into being 
    co-opted to make up the numbers but this time I am delighted to say, we had 
    12 candidates for 11 seats so we had an election, one of only 11 out of a 
    possible 115 in the CDC area. To back this up we had a pretty good turn out 
    at the polling station and I would like to thank everyone who voted 
    especially if you voted for me! </p>
    <p>Our new team are all here this evening and I will now ask each of them to 
    introduce themselves and say if they are new councillors. </p>
    <p>We had three of our previous council step down at the end of the last 
    session and I must thank all of them for the great work they have done for 
    this village during the past four years. I will not embarrass them by 
    extolling their virtues but we will miss their experience and it will be a 
    hard act for this new team to follow. Thank you so very much to David Smith, 
    Christina Pollard and our own Mr Fixit Tony Squire. </p>
    <p>So what have we as a council achieved for you as a community in the past 
    12 months? In fact this council can be rather proud of its achievements and 
    also of how well we have managed the budget in obtaining those achievements. 
    The successes were the result of darned good team work not only within this 
    council but also with our working in partnership with all sorts of 
    individuals, officials and organisations. </p>
    <p>Our house keeping budget or the annual precept to give it its correct 
    title was £57,000 for 2006-07. We actually spent 92.13% of that totalling 
    £54,189.04. This current year we have to start various schemes you asked for 
    in the Village Plan and we have increased the precept to £66,750 which means 
    that a dwelling in the “B” band of council tax is paying £48.26 per year 
    towards everything this parish council does. In fact the increase per week 
    due to the raise in the precept is about 12p or 13p per week. I suggest we 
    give darned good value for your money. </p>
    <p>So apart from spending your money what have we achieved in the past 12 
    months? </p>
    <p>The most important result I think you will agree was getting Thames Water 
    to undertake the renewal of the faulty pumping main sewer from Robert 
    Franklin Way to Shorncote at a projected cost of £5 million. To go back to 
    my previous statement, this was undoubtedly the result of teamwork. 
    Individuals like David Spencer did a lot towards the result, this Parish 
    Council used their influence with special mention of Philip Nicholas who 
    attended the Flooding Forum meetings where I know he used his negotiating 
    skills to our advantage, our local District Councillors especially Clive 
    Bennett who was like a bull dog getting results and our MP Geoffrey 
    Clifton-Brown who I know kicked some very complacent backsides and got 
    results. Despite various claims by different political parties at the 
    election hustings, no one person or party was responsible for the result. We 
    did it together. Thanks to all involved. </p>
    <p>In last year’s minutes there is mention of the Village Plan which we had 
    put together just before that meeting. Some of the items on that Plan are 
    permanently ongoing objectives but some of the definite aims have been 
    completed. The most impressive being the new Play Group building. It is a 
    fantastic place and a tremendous credit to the playgroup team responsible 
    for getting it done. The Parish Council have supported the scheme from the 
    start but it was their team that deserve all the praise.</p>
    <p>Again, in last year’s meeting we spoke about the then newly formed Youth 
    Parish Council. This group of young people have gone from strength to 
    strength and it is especially good to see their representatives here tonight 
    and one of them is giving a report later. </p>
    <p>In conjunction with our friends in GRCC we carried out a Housing Needs 
    Survey. That shows that there is a higher than expected demand for housing 
    by local people who wish to remain in the village but cannot afford to. How 
    that need can be satisfied will tax our brains for the next few years. </p>
    <p>The old Preaching Cross has been renovated and looks so much better. It 
    looked really tatty after the War Memorial was rebuilt so now we have both 
    to be proud of. Incidentally, a special thank you to the person or people 
    who are putting fresh flowers on the War Memorial. It’s a very special 
    action and one that so many appreciate. </p>
    <p>Once again we were successful in the Calor Gas Village of the Year 
    competition and came home with £1,000 in our pocket. Last year we won the 
    £500 first prizes in the categories for IT and “Young People” and were 
    runners up in the Building Community Life competition. </p>
    <p>We were not on the podium in the Bledisloe Cup last summer despite being 
    in the finals. </p>
    <p>At long last the three Vehicle Activated Signs were installed at the 
    major entrances to the village and seem to have had the desired effect on 
    most speeding drivers as have the new speed limits along the Cirencester 
    road past Trenchard Gardens. We have requested that speed traps are used on 
    that section but we are never informed by the police if they actually do 
    such checks. </p>
    <p>The new Crossing Patrol or lollypop lady as I still call her at the High 
    Street junction with Broadway Lane is good to see. We were looking at having 
    a pedestrian crossing there but after a traffic and pedestrian survey 
    Gloucestershire Highways informed us that it was not justified and they 
    would not install one. </p>
    <p>Still on the question of streets, we have been promised that Broadway 
    Lane will be resurfaced but not until Thames Water has completed their pipe 
    laying works along that road. Until then, please drive along it with great 
    care! </p>
    <p>On the credit side we part financed the additional street lights in that 
    area which has made it easier to see the pot holes! </p>
    <p>We also subsidised the building by GCC PROW of the new foot bridge over 
    the river Churn on the canal path between the Lock House and Siddington. 
    That is part of our long term scheme in both the Village Appraisal and the 
    Village Plan, to construct a path suitable for not only pedestrians but also 
    wheel chair users and cyclists. </p>
    <p>Another batch of broadleaf trees has been planted in the Upper Up 
    recreation area and our thanks to those members of the community who have 
    paid for these to commemorate either a loved one or a special event in their 
    lives. That area is developing into a great facility for us all. </p>
    <p>Again this past year we have used the services of the Payback in the 
    Community people to carry out work we could not have otherwise afforded. I 
    hope this service continues to be available to us. </p>
    <p>Earlier I thanked all the councillors for their work and commitment but I 
    must now say a special thank you to our clerk Maurice McKee. Without 
    Maurice’s dedication to this village we would be struggling. How anyone can 
    get through the variety of tasks that he does is beyond my comprehension and 
    to do it all with his some times wacky sense of humour makes it a pleasure 
    to work with him. Maurice, many thanks for all your efforts. They are truly 
    appreciated. </p>
    <p>So that was the year that was! We had a very successful 12 months and if 
    we can achieve anything like it again this year, things will continue to 
    roll on for Cerney.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT BY PCSO LESLEY POOLEY, GLOUCESTERSHIRE CONSTABULARY</b><br>
    <br>
    PCSO Pooley had little time to prepare for the meeting as she was not given 
    the task until very recently. Nevertheless PCSO Pooley gave a comprehensive 
    statistical report on the occurrence of crime in the area. Notably, the 
    number of crimes recorded was very low. </p>
    <p>Mrs J. Roberts proposed that the meeting record its thanks and 
    appreciation for the work performed by PCSO Pooley. The meeting was all in 
    favour. </p>
    <p>The Chairman thanked PCSO L. Pooley (Gloucestershire Constabulary) for 
    her attendance as it was her off duty period. </p>

        restrict the hours when the play area at Robert Franklin Way could be 
        used and signs stating such would be erected shortly. The Youth Parish 
        Council would be consulted to see if they had any ideas on how the

    <p>.<b>REPORT FROM CLLR SHAUN PARSONS (GCC)</b> </p>
    <p>This year I will provide a brief outline of the range of services which 
    the county council provides and also the financial constraints within which 
    it works. The county council budget is about £600m compared to the Districts 
    £12m. Of this £600m, £300m of this is the schools budget and ring fenced.</p>
    <p>By way of background the county is experiencing growth in the elderly and 
    retired relative to the total population and it is therefore no surprise 
    that the single largest expense item is the Community and Adult Care 
    directorate, better known as Social Services, this is about £120m and 
    growing. The Children and Youth directorate has a budget of about £70m. This 
    directorate is responsible for administering schools and includes other 
    services such as the youth service. Financing costs amount to about £30m and 
    is forecast to grow significantly. The Community Safety directorate, which 
    is mainly accounted for by the Fire Service amounts to about £25m. This 
    leaves the Environment Directorate which amounts to about £50m and is 
    accounted for in the main by highways expenditure, (this excludes capital 
    expenditure on roads) and waste, though there are a number of other services 
    which it is responsible for such as economic development. </p>
    <p>Local Government continues to have to meet the burden of a number of 
    stealth taxes of which maybe the best known is the so called pension tax. 
    18% of the wages bill is now accounted for by pensions contributions. 
    Further stealth taxes introduced recently have been the 5% charge on capital 
    expenditure, which hits the highways hard since large amounts of highways 
    expenditure is capitalised. Lastly this year the national government have 
    introduced a further significant land fill levy. All these taxes reduce the 
    amount of money which is available to spend on services since the government 
    ensures that the total pot of money is kept relatively small. The government 
    award this year was £2.6%, which was way below inflation. None the less the 
    Conservative administration managed to hold the council tax increase to 
    3.4%, the lowest increase in council tax since it was introduced ten years 
    ago. </p>
    <p>Lastly residents should be aware that Gloucestershire does relatively 
    poorly compared to other counties in the amount of money it receives School 
    expenditure is £315 per child less than the average county, equivalent to 
    £25m per annum; the Police £14m less; the NHS £66m.less. Despite continuing 
    efforts, it would seem that central government feel that more money is not 
    necessary since Gloucestershire has low levels of unemployment and is seen 
    as a relatively well of county. However why this argument applies to our 
    children I fail to understand. </p>
    <p>Cllr P. Jay stated that the Parish Council was very grateful for the 
    representations made on its behalf by Cllr Parsons but he was critical of 
    the lack of facilities provided by Gloucestershire County Council for the 
    youth of the village. From statistics recently supplied by MAIDeN and 
    sponsored by GCC there were 434 youths in the age range 10-19 which was 
    above the average for towns and villages of similar size to South Cerney 
    within the Cotswold District and Gloucestershire as a whole. Coupled with 
    those who were above the age of 44 being less than average it was obvious 
    that South Cerney was not an old foggy village. </p>

    <b>REPORT FROM CAPTAIN GILES CUTTER, ADJUTANT 29th PC &amp; MC</b><br>
    <br>
    Over the last 12 months 29 PC &amp; Mov Regt RLC has continued to provide 
    service support in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as undertaking worldwide 
    deployments in smaller groupings. This included the deployment of regimental 
    soldiers to Lebanon to facilitate the evacuation of civilian nationals 
    during the hostilities last summer. At any one time, around a third of the 
    regiment has been away supporting operations. The Joint Air Mounting Centre 
    continues to assist the movement of UK-based troops to operational and 
    exercise theatres. </p>
    <p>The rejuvenation of the Duke of Gloucester Barracks has continued with 
    the completion of the workshop and wash-down and the imminent commissioning 
    of the new dining hall (the foundation stone of which was laid by the Duke 
    of Gloucester in spring last year). Upgraded Single Living-in Accommodation 
    Modules (SLAM) are under construction and, along with improved utilities, 
    will assist the receipt of the Regiment’s two new squadrons which will move 
    to South Cerney in the period Jun 08 - Jul 10. The two-phase transition will 
    see 60 new personnel arriving next year with a further 60 shortly 
    afterwards. </p>
    <p>The unit continues to undertake a broad range of sporting and 
    extra-curricular activities, making best use of the airfield and the Water 
    Park facilities. This includes the development of the Silver Stars freefall 
    team and military sports parachute instruction which is largely financed by 
    offering spare seats in the team’s aircraft to civilian enthusiasts. The 
    team’s activities are reported annually through the autumn Airfield Liaison 
    Meeting.<br>

    <b>REPORT FROM JOE LODGE, MEMBER OF SOUTH CERNEY YOUTH COUNCIL</b><br>
    <br>
    Hello ladies and gentlemen, I am Joe Lodge I am communicator for the South 
    Cerney Youth Parish Council, we as a council were set up in October of last 
    year by the CDC Youth Participation Officer Claire Dowan in conjunction will 
    the South Cerney Parish Council. We spent the first couple of months working 
    on how the youth parish council would work and what it is intended to do, 
    from this we have decided to act as a shadow committee of the current parish 
    council with the only change being the role of the clerk being split into 
    two positions with a Minute Taker whose job is to take the minutes and write 
    them up from our monthly meetings this position was filled by Sinead Peare 
    and a Communicator who is responsible for the agendas and the other 
    communications as filled by me. We have since also elected our chairperson 
    or so called “Bossy Person” filled by Rebecca Lodge who is unable to attend 
    due to work, and will be leaving the council due to attending university in 
    September. And elected a Finance Manager renamed “The Man with the money” 
    this position was filled by Michael Brown. Also joining the council 
    currently concentrating on PR are Dominic Brown and Rachel King, and we have 
    specialist representatives from the local secondary schools for Deer Park: 
    Tomas Nicholas and for Kingshill: Dan Mills. </p>
    <p>We as a council have a separate budget; in an account only the youth 
    parish council can access, with grants from the older parish council the CDC 
    and a private donation and the winnings from winning the Calor gas best 
    villages in the youth section and once we are better established intend to 
    use this to benefit the youth of the village. We make reports on what we 
    have done each month to the older parish council and their monthly meetings. 
    So far we have organised two major events both held in upper up play field. 
    The first was a organised sports day in conjunction with Scott Burry, the 
    CDC’s Sports Development officer who brought in coaches and we allowed the 
    youth from the village and surrounding areas to be instructed in sports such 
    as tennis, cricket and football. We have since in organised a Fun Run to 
    raise money for sports relief, which was a major success with approximately 
    150 attendees. </p>
    <p>In the future we plan to hold another of the Sports days with assistance 
    from Scott Bury, and an organised event based on Sports and Play due to the 
    summer off the streets campaign all to raise profile and we also intend in 
    the future to send out leaflets and questionnaires to get more of the 
    youth’s opinion. If you would like to contact us leave a comment on to our 
    section of the parish council webpage or me directly by my email, which also 
    appears on the site. If you have anything concerning the youth of the 
    village, which requires funding you can fill out a funding application that 
    appears on the page as well as the minutes of the monthly meetings. We 
    intend to have an election in June should any young person be interested in 
    standing for a position please contact me and our AGM is scheduled for the 
    21st of June. </p>
    <p>Thanks for listening do you have any Questions about the Youth Parish 
    Council or our role?<br>

    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CLLR. C. BENNETT (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr C. Bennett firstly introduced the two newly elected District 
    Councillors, Mrs Judith Aram and Peter Messenger to the meeting. He then 
    paid tribute to Mrs Anne Clark who had represented the ward for the past 12 
    years. </p>
    <p>Twelve months ago I was appointed to the Cabinet of the district council 
    with the portfolio of Safe and Strong Communities. I am responsible for a 
    department of the council which deals with anti-social behaviour so I have 
    spent a considerable amount of time working with the police and schools. It 
    has been very interesting but I know there is a long way to go and there is 
    no single, simple answer to the problems caused by a small minority of 
    youngsters. I sit on the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership committee 
    which is made up of a variety of agencies ranging from Police, drug 
    rehabilitation, probation service, prolific offenders, youth service schools 
    and fire service. This committee provided £10,000 for an investigation into 
    the anti-social behaviour black spots in Cirencester. </p>
    <p>With the assistance of the police my department in the council has 
    extended the area of Cirencester where it is an offence to drink in a public 
    place. It’s been spread out from the town centre area to cover the Beeches 
    and Chesterton. There had been problems with drunken youths on the public 
    open spaces so a crackdown was necessary. </p>
    <p>I spent a day out with the mobile police station. It was a great 
    experience and the travelling copper is a very welcome sight in some of the 
    smaller communities. It is an excellent intelligence gathering operation. 
    People who called at the van often passed on snippets which all helped to 
    build up a bigger picture and identified crime hotspots. </p>
    <p>The new Neighbourhood policing scheme means that we should soon have four 
    police officers dedicated to the area around South Cerney and the Water 
    Park. Perhaps the next thing will be to house them locally and we can call 
    them village Bobbies. What goes round comes round! </p>
    <p>The council’s Community Welfare department has been raising its profile 
    in the last year with anti-crime exhibitions and promotions in many places 
    in the Cotswolds. Advice has been given on many aspects of property and 
    personal security. </p>
    <p>I am pleased to report that a survey carried out in the county revealed 
    that those people who felt safest lived in the Cotswolds. Almost 96% of 
    those spoken to felt safe walking alone in the district during the daytime 
    and 66% felt safe walking alone at night. We all know that statistically we 
    live in a safe area. I think the figures show that we are getting the 
    message across. </p>
    <p>I am expecting to be re-appointed to the cabinet with an increased 
    portfolio, now to include licensing and cemeteries. </p>

    <b>2006 CHURCH REPORT READ BY MR T. SQUIRE ON BEHALF OF THE VICAR, REV’D J. 
    CALVERT</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>All Hallows, South Cerney</b> </p>
    <p><i><b>Fabric:</b></i> most notable was the effort to raise the sum to 
    repair the two west windows in the church. The centre window commemorating 
    Ann Edwards contains Victorian glass of a high quality contained within 15th 
    century tracery. The tracery needed urgent repair as it was beginning to 
    damage the stained glass. Grants were obtained and both jig saws and 
    Christmas cards were produced to help raise the sum required. The repairs 
    were carried out in early 2007 and the window is now fully restored. </p>
    <p>The enlargement of the churchyard finally came to fruition last summer 
    with a visit by the Bishop of Gloucester, Michael Perham, to consecrate the 
    new extension. It is now being used for the interment of ashes. </p>
    <p><i><b>Ministry:</b></i> All Hallows continues to minister to all 
    residents in the parish through the work of church members and the local 
    ministry team. This ministry involves a ministry to the sick and bereaved, 
    regular contact with Ann Edwards School and the village playgroup. Both 
    playgroup and school have attended church on various occasions in the year 
    and the vicar led assemblies. “Open the Book” is a popular way of 
    introducing Bible stories to the school children and this scheme is provided 
    by a team of church members and a representative from the United Church. </p>
    <p>Holy Week, 2006 saw some innovations with a very popular donkey-led 
    procession on Palm Sunday, Stations of the Cross and a meal with Communion 
    on Maundy Thursday. Christmas 2006 saw a full church for our candle-lit 
    Carol Service, Midnight Communion and Crib Service. These and other ventures 
    help to bring the Gospel message afresh to those who chose to take part. </p>
    <p>The Church Street Fair and Flower Festival in its present form began in 
    1991 and, to quote from a piece of publicity in 1993 (written by Janis 
    Greenwood), helped us to see that “our mission in South Cerney included, 
    among other things, helping to foster a sense of community in an 
    increasingly individualistic age”. Although the event has grown like topsy 
    over the years and is an essential part of our annual financing, your 
    church’s aim in running the event is still very much the same. </p>
    <p><b>Holy Trinity, Cerney Wick</b> </p>
    <p>Holy Trinity continues its monthly services and caters for a small number 
    of villages supported a contingent from South Cerney. For several years 
    discussions have centred around the possible dual use of the church building 
    both as a place of worship and a village hall. I am extremely disappointed 
    to acknowledge that what at first appeared to be an exciting and viable 
    project, fully supported by the diocese and the Parochial Church Council, 
    eventually failed because it was not supported by the majority of villagers. 
    This means that the future of the church building is not secure. </p>
    <p><b>Closing Comments</b> </p>
    <p>This is my last report for the Parish Council as, after 20 years of 
    ministry in the parish, I am to retire shortly. It has been a privilege to 
    share in so many people’s joys and sorrows and, as well as exercising 
    leadership in the church, I hope I have also contributed positively to the 
    community at large.</p>
    <p>With my prayers and best wishes for South Cerney and Cerney Wick as they 
    face the future.<br>
    <br>
    <b>SOUTH CERNEY UNITED CHURCH REPORT BY RETA-MAY MATTHEWS</b> </p>
    <p>As the representative from South Cerney United Church, I wish to thank 
    the Parish Council and other village organisations not only for this 
    opportunity to speak but for their support over the last several years 
    during our redevelopment. For those of you not familiar with us we are a 
    non-conformist joint Congregational and Methodist Church welcoming all 
    denominations to worship and share in our community activities. We are part 
    of a local group of Churches based in Cirencester and our current minister 
    is ordained through the United Reformed Church. Our congregation in South 
    Cerney consists of approximately 30 members and adherents. We are fully 
    accredited to provide baptism, wedding, funeral and pastoral care services. </p>
    <p>Over the past several years we had made significant improvements to our 
    building including access for all abilities which has allowed us to greatly 
    expand our weekly activities and services to our members and to the 
    community. In addition to our original Sunday worship, Thursday coffee 
    morning and monthly Fellowship, we have been running a very successful 
    Parents and Toddlers morning for approximately 9 years. &quot;Cerney Seedlings&quot; 
    has about 30 little ones on the active register and more are being added on 
    a regular basis. Events such as The Cirencester Band Concert and our monthly 
    non-cash Bingo afternoons are also well attended. </p>
    <p>Several years ago we extended our weekly coffee morning to include a 
    lunch club which is very popular and this is followed by an activities 
    afternoon where people are encouraged to congregate to knit, play board 
    games, Whist or just to ‘sit and natter’. We also have arts and crafts on a 
    separate afternoon. Our worship services now include a bible study group and 
    informal quiet times set aside for contemplation, discussion, music, prayer 
    and sharing to enrich our spiritual life. There is something along these 
    lines available every Monday at 2:30 pm so anyone of any denomination can 
    come to join us especially if they have missed a Sunday service. All our 
    special events and weekly activities are well publicised in the Cerney News. 
    We would like to see increased village participation at these as they are 
    meant to be all inclusive. </p>
    <p>The CDC also runs two exercise programs at our facility. One is geared 
    for the less active as a falls prevention course and the other is 18 moves 
    for health, calm and well being. The ‘Active and Able’ class is very well 
    attended but the Tai Chi for beginners may have to be discontinued as 
    attendance is dropping. If you know of anyone who is not up to the Tai Chi 
    Classes here at the Village Hall, one of our two courses may suit them. This 
    week the CDC has also started a pilot group Weight Management Course with us 
    and it is already fully booked. Other than these CDC sponsored events, all 
    our activities are run by unpaid volunteers from our church and members of 
    our Circuit churches.</p>
    <p>Currently the only day of the week that the building is not in regular 
    use is Friday. Since we are now seen as a bit of a village &quot;drop in&quot; centre, 
    we would like to encourage some organisation other than ourselves to come in 
    on Fridays to perform just such a service. I don’t know how it can be done 
    or what the limitations would be, but we are ideally situated for such a 
    service to be offered. I am sure many in the village who care for an elderly 
    or disabled person would be glad of a safe, secure environment where their 
    loved one could perhaps have lunch and be cared for over a few hours. I have 
    been contacted by one person with similar thoughts and would appreciate any 
    input, positive or negative, from any interested party. </p>
    <p>All our rooms are available for rental and with our new improvements 
    rental income has increased. We are currently looking for a qualified 
    cleaner 4 hours a month to help keep things in order. If you know of anyone 
    please let us know. The candidate will have to be CRB checked at our expense 
    to comply with our &quot;Safe from Harm&quot; policy as we are a popular venue for 
    children’s parties etc. St John’s Ambulance Courses are regularly held in 
    our building. With the addition of a new electric piano, we are also now 
    regularly renting to music groups for rehearsals and meetings and other 
    village and local organisations have used our rooms from time to time as we 
    keep our rental fees in line with those of the Village Hall. </p>
    <p>On occasion we worship with All Hallows and we work in conjunction with 
    them to present a united Christian presence in the village. They continue to 
    use our building and share utility costs and other agreed expenses. Income 
    from rentals also goes into the Joint Church Account to help defray these 
    expenditures. Recently and in the past I have received phone calls regarding 
    the Old Post Office and although the former residents were members of our 
    church, we would like to point out that we are in no way connected to the 
    sale or the development of said property which was left to Cancer Research.</p>
    <p>Lastly, South Cerney United Church would like to invite you all to 
    celebrate the completion of our latest redevelopment project on Sunday 24th 
    June. Refreshments will be served from 4:30pm onwards and will be followed 
    by a special Thanksgiving service at 6pm led by our minister Rev Stuart 
    Drummond.</p>
    <p><b>REPORT ON ANN EDWARDS CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIMARY SCHOOL READ BY ROGER 
    EDGAR ON BEHALF OF STEPHEN RICHARDSON, HEADTEACHER</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Personnel</b><br>
    We have seen more changes in staff this year. Mrs Anne Clayton and Mrs 
    Stefanie Rothery were taken on as teaching assistants and Mr Andrew Kirkup 
    and Miss Molly Russell as full-time teachers. We also congratulate Mrs Vicki 
    Roseblade who is pregnant. The governing body has also seen more changes 
    with Mrs Cheryl Svennson, Mr Steven Walker and Mrs Vicki Jones joining us as 
    parent governors.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Curriculum and SATS</b><br>
    All the children in KS2 and Y2 are about to take their optional or statutory 
    SATs and our SATs results for 2006 were very pleasing, with excellent 
    progress being made by children within the school and pupils achieving well 
    at the end of KS2. The school continues to offer a good quality of education 
    for its pupils and they receive a broad and balanced curriculum. We are a 
    category 2A school within the LEA.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other extra curricular school activities</b><br>
    The school continues to offer a full range of after school clubs including 
    for example, football, netball, tag rugby, cricket, rounders, cookery, 
    gardening, Spanish, computer, chess, bug club, scrabble club, modelling/warhammer 
    club, French, drama and judo. These are well attended by the pupils. Our Y4, 
    Y5 and Y6 children have either taken part in or will soon be taking part in 
    residential visits to The Wilderness Centre, Braeside, and Skern Lodge. We 
    now offer an after school club from 3pm-6pm run by Gooseberry Bush nursery 
    and take up as been very good. Plans for a breakfast club are being 
    considered for September. Premier Sports now co-ordinate clubs in 
    basketball, football and gymnastics.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Health 4 Schools</b> <br>
    We are taking part in the above project with a view to increasing children’s 
    awareness of growing, cooking and eating their own food and keeping fit. We 
    have installed better cooking equipment in school and each class has access 
    to an area to grow vegetables and plants. Our broad beans and other crops 
    are looking good. We have started a toastie Tuesday initiative where 
    children can buy toast at break time and this is also proving very popular.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other projects</b><br>
    We have had visits from the Lifestyle Education Bus, various theatre groups, 
    Nick Williams the Birdwise man and the children have visited SCOEC for two 
    days. Pupils will be taking part in the Dance Festival, schools swimming 
    gala and have played a number of sporting fixtures against other schools. We 
    continue to work closely with the Playgroup in their new building and we 
    have allowed them to use part of our playing field which will soon be fenced 
    to allow them more grass area. We have plans to add to our outdoor play 
    equipment over the summer term – the tyre play system has been a wonderful 
    addition and the entrance to the school is to be moved to allow better 
    access and exit from school. </p>

    <b>VILLAGE HALL REPORT BY MRS A. STUART</b><br>
    <br>
    The hall continues to be used by diverse groups, from toddlers who have been 
    honing their cooking skills, to the Cosy Club, run by the older members of 
    the community. </p>
    <p>A number of changes took place on the management committee, with Peter 
    Jay stepping down after carrying out the duties of treasurer for a number of 
    years. We were delighted to welcome Roger and Gill Scott who have taken on 
    the task. The Caretaker also stood down after 6 years of sterling work. We 
    were pleased to welcome John Veitch to the position of Booking 
    Clerk/Cleaner. John continues to keep up the standards set by Fiona and 
    Nigel Keates, the previous Caretaker duo. </p>
    <p>This year a decision was made to change the night of running the Cerney 
    Cinema from Saturday to Friday. As last year, attendance during the winter 
    months was down, which was not helped by the poor choice of films. However 
    the CDC has been able to arrange for popular films to be shown over the past 
    couple of months and we have raised a considerable amount of money towards 
    village hall funds. (On Friday we are showing ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ – why 
    not come along – I understand it is an excellent film, in June we are 
    showing ‘The History Boys’ and in July we hope to show ‘Miss Potter’ – so 
    you see currently it remains a good selection of films.) </p>
    <p>Again all on the Village Hall Management Committee would like to thank 
    the Parish Council for their continued financial support. </p>
    <p>Finally thanks should go to all the Trustees of the Village Hall who 
    continue to be very proactive. Attendance at committee meetings remains 
    excellent and generally everyone works for the good of the hall. Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <b>DAVID HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CERNEY WICK VILLAGE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
    <p>Dr Howard jokingly mentioned that a more appropriate title might be the 
    Cerney Wick Tent Committee now that tents had been substituted in place of 
    the village hall. He was disappointed that the dual purpose plan envisaged 
    for the use of Holy Trinity church as a village hall had for various reasons 
    been abandoned primarily in his view as there was no security of tenure and 
    there was the emotional problem with some residents reconciling the change 
    from a building of worship to include secular activities. It was the 
    intention of the Cerney Wick Village Committee to erect a village hall and 
    he hoped that the scheme might be included in the South Cerney Parish 
    Council’s village plan projects.</p>
    <p>Dr Howard complained about the state of the verges, especially in the 
    vicinity of “Morning Dew”, caused by contractors’ vehicles parked there and 
    forcing other large vehicles using the carriageway to use the opposite verge 
    when passing by, thereby causing damage. The road verge was very dilapidated 
    and he would like to see the lane restored. Cllr Caunce interrupted stating 
    that he had been in contact with the owner of the property who had agreed to 
    inform the contractors and made a commitment to reinstate. </p>
    <p>Dr Howard was also concerned about the junction of Cerney Wick lane, 
    Station Road and the Spine Road which he considered dangerous. He suggested 
    that speed restrictions be imposed. Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) informed him that 
    speed restrictions are being discussed. </p>
    <p>One gentleman in the audience enquired if the car park at Upper Up might 
    be resurfaced in tarmacadam. Cllr M. Stuart replied that an estimate had 
    been acquired but the cost was prohibitive. At today’s prices it would cost 
    in the range of £25,000. It was not just the laying of tarmacadam but also 
    the associated drainage work which would be necessary. By creating such a 
    large area rain water would flood into Upper Up causing more problems. </p>
    <p>Cllr Mrs Land complained about the speed of some vehicles in Broadway 
    Lane. </p>
    <p>There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 9.20pm.</p>
