 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge apologised for her absence due to a
 family reunion. Cllr Bennett (CDC) had apologised for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 10th JUNE 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that
 the minutes were a true and accurate record. Members of the Parish Council were
 all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge informed the Parish Council that the Youth
 Parish Council (YPC) had a meeting with Clare Dowan (CDC) and discussed future
 strategy and plans for the transition period. There would be a turnover of
 personnel within the YPC and it was agreed a preferable option was to replace
 members en bloc instead of by piecemeal recruitment. A notice would be
 published in Cerney News, probably in September after the holidays, asking for
 volunteers. The YPC had decided that it favoured the “Birds Nest” type of play
 equipment for the redundant basketball court at Upper Up. Sinead Peare asked
 the Parish Council for the precise area and amount of money available for the
 scheme. Cllr Nicholas explained to her that there was more than enough area to
 fulfil the ambition. Cllr Stuart told her that it was first of all necessary to
 contact some play equipment representatives and for them to estimate a cost for
 various equipment capacities. Cllr Mrs Land will help the group by making
 contact with suppliers.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger (CDC) will contact Cllr Bennett (CDC)
 regarding the possibility of setting up an evening meeting with the Mr Neudegg,
 Chief Executive Officer at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce enquired if there was anything to report on
 the grant application on behalf of the Football Club to GPFA. Cllr Jay reported
 that the GPFA was minded to make a grant but first of all it needed
 confirmation that an application had been made to the Football Foundation as
 the money requested would primarily be used for football activities. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land had eventually made contact with Paul Swift
 at Gloucestershire Highways and arranged to meet with him at 4pm on Wednesday
 15th July. Cllr Nicholas would, if circumstances allowed, also attend to
 discuss the pavement design at the Old Post Office. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Caunce
 that a letter of thanks be sent to Mr R. Lawrence at Cotswold Hoburne for his
 cooperation in removing the advertising hoardings alongside the Spine Road.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 11th June I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a
 meeting with Roger Sollis CDC and Clair a CDC environmental warden at the Upper
 Up car park recycling area. Sita had obviously been there and tidied up prior
 to our arrival and besides some evidence of broken glass and the odd empty beer
 can the site was reasonably clean. CDC will continue to monitor the site. The
 problem of gouging was discussed and in an ideal world a concrete plinth for
 the bins to rest on would eliminate the problem. Everyone is aware of the
 financial restraints currently in force but if this site is to continue some
 effort and compromise must be found to the damage being caused. I emailed Cllr
 Bennett to thank him for his input in cracking the communications breakdown
 between the Parish Council and the Waste Management team at CDC. Our long
 association with Roger Sollis assures us that our trust and faith in the Waste
 Management team will be rebuilt. Cllr Stuart visits the area on most days and
 if the situation worsens we are confident that any report will now be acted
 upon. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 15th June I attended a briefing session given by
 Kim Bedford of GAPTC at CDC Trinity Road on the Power of Well Being. Its powers
 are similar to S.137 with the exception that grants can be made to individuals
 and schemes outside the geographical area of the council. Before a Parish
 Council can use the regulation the Clerk must have the CiLCA qualification, 80%
 of Parish Councillors must have attended a training module, the Parish Council
 must have a community engagement statement of intent in place and at least
 two-thirds of members of the council must have stood for election. Every time a
 council is elected the Power of Well Being must be reaffirmed. Under current
 S.137 regulations Parish Councils can spend £6.15 per elector per annum. South
 Cerney had 2,616 electors on 1st February 2009 so it can spend just over
 £16,000 on schemes under S.137. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 23rd June I attended a meeting of the Play
 Portfolio group at CDC. I released the Completion Certificate for the youth
 shelter to Rosemary Lynn. The mobile skate park which was withdrawn from use by
 Gloucestershire’s Health and Safety officers because of the number of persons
 needed to service its operation will now be sold as a fixed unit. Discussions
 to provide an alternative piece of kit are continuing with another contractor
 from West Oxfordshire. The plan is for the delivery of 12 sessions over the
 summer period which will be advertised in the “Summer Off The Streets”
 brochure. This brochure which will be 24 pages packed with events will be
 published shortly. Two sites at Lechlade and Andoversford have been favoured by
 the Playbuilder project and a further two will be selected from a short list of
 five. The priority criteria needed for selection is proof of deprivation of
 play facilities. Claire Dowan (CDC) will enquire if a metal plaque is available
 for the youth shelter to replace the plastic stick-on ones which are
 continually removed. The next meeting was arranged for 22nd September starting
 at the earlier time of 10am. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 24th June I attended a meeting of the Finance
 Committee to which Roger Scott, Treasurer of the Village Hall, was invited.
 Cllr Jay, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb also attended. Cllr Mrs Land
 had sent her apology for absence as she had been delayed. The objective of the
 meeting was to reallocate the funds held in reserve by the Parish Council.
 Roger Scott produced a projection over the next 10 years of potential expenses
 for the Village Hall. The roofing of this Committee Room was the most urgent
 matter although other schemes including the rethatching of the main roof should
 also be considered. The Village Hall committee had received various quotations
 for the urgent repair of the Committee Room roof and are minded to accept one
 using Rhepanol a synthetic covering which can be applied without heat and is
 guaranteed for 25 years whereas asphalt has only a 10 year life. After
 discussion it was decided to amalgamate the Village Hall roof maintenance with
 the Village Hall fabric amounts to create a Village Hall reserve fund. The Play
 Equipment replacement fund was increased by £5,000 through reducing the Road
 Safety Improvements &amp; Lighting reserve by a similar amount. A major capital
 investment to refurbish the surface of the Upper Up car park would be a
 priority which would be financed directly through the precept as a one-off
 improvement. The scheme would be publicised to residents through the Cerney
 News. It was estimated that it could cost between £20,000 and £25,000. The
 meeting closed at 9pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 25th June I accompanied Cllr Webb to a meeting
 of the Gloucestershire Charter group at the Fire Station in Barnwood,
 Gloucester. Martyn Summerell Senior Area Highways Manager of Gloucestershire
 Highways was asked to explain the delay in producing the feasibility assessment
 on the cyclepath outside the Four Pillars Hotel on the Spine Road.
 Unfortunately he couldn’t but promised to let me know within a week and if not
 I was to contact him. On other matters he explained that the new 08000 514 514
 method of contacting local offices was working well; the system was handling
 about 1,000 calls a week with the longest waiting time 2 minutes 30 seconds.
 The operation of the scheme is guaranteed for a year and if feed back
 substantiates its success an application for its extension will be made. There
 is a backlog of £170 million of road repairs. There are 35,000 potholes fixed
 every year and a new monthly initiative called Pothole Friday now operates
 where senior managers inspect how the repairs are being carried out. Eighty per
 cent of potholes are repaired by the hot fix method and to extend the working
 life of the material major depots are being fitted out with heating bins to
 keep the tarmacadam ready for use throughout the day. The second round of grass
 cutting will start on Monday 6th July with main roads and major junctions
 taking priority. This will be followed after 6 weeks with a third cut. Mr
 Summerell asked that if there were any areas which needed attention outside of
 the schedule a report should be made to the freephone.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Carey Wallin, Putting People First Programme Manager at
 GCC, gave a talk on how the scheme was being administered. Putting People First
 sets the direction for adult social care over the next 10 years and more. She
 described the sort of society it envisages, where people can have choice and
 control in their lives, and whether they need support from others now or in the
 future. It concentrates on helping people live independently in their own
 homes. Further information will be available from the Village Agents when they
 come to visit Parish Councillors before the meeting on 12th August. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Hester Hunt informed the meeting that the meetings would
 be held quarterly instead of the bi-monthly arrangement. The next meeting will
 be notified shortly but it was expected to be in September or October. The
 meeting closed at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During June of the 22 available working days I averaged 3
 hours 12 minutes per day which is less than 2 hours a week than the time
 allowed in my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th JULY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley,
 Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce opened the meeting at 7.05pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had sent an apology for her absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Crime Prevention.</b> Cllr Stuart reported that Cllr
 Jay had attended a meeting organised by A.PS Mark Godsland Ad Cert ED &amp; CP,
 Cotswold District, Crime Prevention Design Advisor, National Bike Safe Crime
 Reduction Advisor &amp; IAM Group Observer (MC) from the Cotswold and Stroud
 Division of Gloucestershire Police. Members of the Cricket and Football Clubs
 were also in attendance. Various methods of deterring the current wave of
 vandalism of the facilities at Upper Up were discussed at the meeting on 30th
 June. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow.</b> Cllr Harris reported that a gas pipe from
 Box Bush bridge eastwards would be installed. The work would eventually lead to
 the removal of the unsightly pipes at Bridge House. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shorncote Link</b>. Cllr Stuart stated that flooding
 was a continuing problem on the public footpath leading to the Country Park at
 Somerford Keynes. Drainage pipes through the path had been of some benefit but
 more were needed. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP had replied favourably to a letter
 requesting his influence on outstanding matters regarding the sewerage scheme.
 Other work to shore up the entry to Upper Up playing fields from the
 Cirencester to Ashton Keynes road was planned by Mike Barton from
 Gloucestershire Public Rights of Way. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recycling Bins at Upper Up.</b> Cllr Stuart
 complimented the actions of Cllr Bennett (CDC) in using his authority to bring
 about a meeting with the waste department at CDC the day following the last
 Parish Council meeting. The results, so far, have been encouraging although
 some people are still leaving sacks of plastic alongside the bins instead of in
 them. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Shelter.</b> Cllr Stuart reported that on the
 base, three out of the five squares were showing hair line cracks. The
 Committee agreed with his recommendation to continue to withhold the remainder
 of the payment to Park Leisure. The Clerk would keep the contractor informed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Aggregate Industries Contact.</b> Cllr Stuart expects
 the Aggregates surveyor to contact him shortly.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter in Station Road.</b> Cllr Mrs Chubb was
 pleased to report that the structure was now complete and in regular use by
 young and old alike. Cllr Caunce stated that Kevin Messenger who laid the
 concrete base had been particularly cooperative and helpful throughout the
 scheme. The Committee agreed with Cllr Caunce who saw no reason to withhold
 payment to the contractors concerned. The Clerk was asked to arrange for a
 timetable to be published on its notice board and apply to GCC for the
 previously agreed grant to defray its cost. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Litter Picking in Cerney Wick.</b> Mr Curtis had asked
 the Parish Council to reconsider its previous offer. The Committee agreed to
 recommend to the Finance Committee that the Parish Council pays Mr Curtis £12
 per month for a minimum of one visit per month to collect litter in Cerney
 Wick. The Clerk confirmed that Mr Curtis had accepted the revised offer. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow.</b> Cllr Harris asked the
 Clerk to write again in August to Lady Fanshawe to remind her if the evergreen
 hedge and other branches overgrowing the carriageway on the north side of Bow
 Wow, between Lower Mill and the bridge over the river Churn, had not been cut
 back. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lime Trees, Station Road</b>. Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr
 Harris who reported that he had cut back the branches of the Lime trees outside
 the Limes development in Station Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Flooding at Cerney Wick.</b> Cllr Caunce reported that
 he had a positive meeting with Chris Franklin, Paul Swift from Gloucestershire
 Highways, Cllr Mrs Chapman and other village residents to discuss the problem
 of flooding outside the Barn in Cerney Wick. He is hopeful that a solution to
 the problem may will be found. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ANNUAL INSPECTION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Members of the Committee had been asked to read the
 elements of the report relevant to the playgrounds they inspected. Cllr Stuart
 remarked that the report highlighted the unsuitable access from the car park at
 Upper Up to the MUGA for the less able bodied but especially wheeled chairs.
 Cllr Stuart suggested that a material could be laid in the grass to provide a
 better surface for such users and he would research the project more thoroughly
 and report his findings at the next Committee meeting. The access from the
 Langet entrance to the play area could also be included in the scheme.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. Cllr Mrs
 Chubb reported that all equipment was in order. However, there was a Willow
 tree on the west side boundary the limbs of which needed to be removed. The
 Clerk will arrange for a quotation from a suitable contractor. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play equipment was all in order. There was a tree
 in the hedge on the right at the entrance to play area which needed its crown
 raising to give better visibility. The surface of the play equipment area
 needed to be swept. The Clerk will arrange for a quotation from a suitable
 contractor. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the play equipment was in good order. The Fenplay
 safety surface needed the special sand to be reapplied before the end of the
 summer period. The basketball post had still not been removed. The ground
 maintenance contractor had strimmed the cycle mounds during the previous week
 but left areas of seeding wild flowers for later. The base of the youth shelter
 was showing signs of cracking at the joints of the redundant holes. Moles in
 the area are an increasing problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk will compile a basket of tasks for contractors
 to quote for including: removal of fallen Willow limbs on the western boundary
 of Robert Franklin Way playing field; the application of special sand to the
 safety surfaces of the play area at Upper Up; the raising of a tree’s crown in
 the hedge on the right at the entrance to the play ground in Cerney Wick and
 the sweeping of the surface beneath the play equipment there.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees
 to pay both contractors for the installation of the new bus shelter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees
 to pay the £5 entry fee for the GPFA Playing Fields and Play Grounds 2009
 competition. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees
 to consider paying Mr Curtis £12 per month for a minimum of one visit per month
 to collect litter in Cerney Wick. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>UPPER UP CAR PARK REFURBISHMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had noted a material,
 displayed at a show he had attended, which he considered suitable as a means to
 refurbish the surface of the car park. At a rough estimate he thought that it
 would need 1,400 sq.m at a cost of £13 per sq.m plus aggregates and labour. The
 material would support vehicles up to 30 ton per square metre but could not be
 used where the recycling bins are situated because of the gouging of the
 surface during their installation and removal. He will research further and
 report back at the next Committee meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that the surface of the south bound
 carriageway outside Timbrells Close had collapsed forming a perfectly
 hemispherical hole about 30cms in circumference. Cllr Nicholas noted that since
 he made his report the hole had been repaired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported that huge Willow trunk in Gypsy
 Lane (BSC48), near to the bridge which crosses the Shire Ditch is in danger of
 collapse. The Clerk will inform Mike Barton, GCC Public Rights of Way officer. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported disturbances on the playing field at
 Robert Franklin Way. The Committee was not convinced that providing more
 notices would solve the problem. Cllr Harris was advised to contact Les Haines
 Community Safety Officer at CDC for advice. Cllr Harris had spoken to Les
 Haines who advised that notices might provide an element of deterrence. The
 Clerk will arrange for the production of two suitable signs. Cllr Caunce and
 Cllr Stuart agreed to attend a site meeting to be arranged by Cllr Harris with
 Les Haines for further discussion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that materials had been earmarked for
 work to start on the steps in Bow Wow.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb and the Clerk had attended a meeting of the
 Gloucestershire Charter group on 25th June to enquire into the reason for the
 delay in the assessment being carried out by Gloucestershire Highways on the
 implementation of the planning condition to provide a cycleway opposite the
 Four Pillars hotel. Martyn Summerell Senior Area Highways Manager for
 Gloucestershire Highways had emailed an update of his continuing pursuit of a
 solution and delegated a colleague, Terry Gibson to liaise with the Clerk. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the
 meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON
 MONDAY 6th JULY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and
 Cllr Webb had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the expenditure detailed on the spread
 sheet for period 3 was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE PLAYING FIELDS
 AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to pay both contractors for the
 installation of the bus shelter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to pay the £5 entry fee for the

 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to consider paying Mr Curtis £12
 per month for a minimum of one visit per month to collect litter in Cerney
 Wick. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee had not objected to any of the above
 recommendations.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce
 that the Parish Council agrees to the recommendations of the Playing Fields and
 Village Maintenance Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that
 the Parish Council agrees to make the payments recommended by the Finance
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Redistribution of Reserve Funds
 </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed to recommend that the Parish Council
 accepts its reallocation of the Parish Council funds. The Clerk had emailed all
 Parish Councillors with its deliberations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that
 the Parish Council agrees to the redistribution of the Parish Council’s reserve
 funds. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence <br>
 </b>All relevant correspondence to the Committee was noted and no further
 action was deemed necessary with the exception of item 16 which was the
 notification of the outcome of the audit. Chairman of the Finance Committee,
 Cllr Jay commended the Clerk on his efforts and congratulated him on achieving
 a successful outcome of the audit. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE HELD
 ON MONDAY 6th JULY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr
 Stuart and Cllr Webb had attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas opened the meeting
 at 9pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Pavement frontage to Old Post Office, High Street
 (CT.1239 and CT.1241)</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas stated that there had been an obvious lack
 of consideration for the safety of pedestrians, since the new entry/exit road
 will cross the footpath path without any visual warnings. Also, there will be a
 problem created by the attraction for vehicles to park and/or turn at the front
 of Plot 1, creating further hazards to pedestrians. Overall, there has been a
 lack of proper planning during the approval process, because the grass verges
 shown on the planning application fall outside the area of land that is owned
 by the developers. Therefore, it should be requested from Gloucestershire
 Highways that the low-walled island (which would otherwise be used as a
 round-about) and the large expanse of tarmac (which would be used as a car
 park) be replaced by a new area of wide grass verge, to echo and enhance the
 vernacular street scene. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas enquired if the Parish Council had any
 objection to him carrying on with the project. The Parish Council had no
 objection.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BY COTSWOLD DISTRICT

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CONSIDERATION OF A PROPOSITION BY CLLR JAY THAT THE
 RECYCLING BINS AT UPPER UP CAR PARK ARE REMOVED</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In view of the positive developments reported earlier,
 Cllr Jay decided to withdraw his proposition that the recycling bins are
 removed from the Upper Up car park. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land reported that she had been visiting the
 Upper Up playing field and recycling centre at regular intervals to check on
 the abuse of the facilities especially by dog owners.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Between 11th June and 8th July around 6-7.30am she had
 noted a succession of pet owners exercise their animals on the area with scant
 regard for the deposits they leave. Cllr Mrs Land is particularly concerned
 that when dogs foul the children's play area the owners do not collect the
 faeces. Cllr Mrs Land described the main culprits as (a) one man with two dogs,
 (b) one lady with a black labrador and (c) one couple who drive a blue
 Volkswagen Golf. The Clerk will report the incidents to Kate Bishop (CDC) and
 ask for her assistance to solve the problem.</p>
