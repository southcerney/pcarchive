 <p ALIGN="LEFT">APOLOGIES<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">Cllr Smith had made 
 an apology for his absence due to business commitments. Cllr Bennett (CDC) also 
 apologised for his absence.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 12th OCTOBER 2005</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs. Chapman and seconded by Cllr Mrs. 
 Chubb that the Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. Cllr Jay, 
 Cllr Squire and Cllr Webb all abstained as they did not attend the meeting in 
 October. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">MATTERS ARISING</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Football Club<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">Cllr Stuart reported 
 that he had written to Gordon Stratford regarding the use of the Upper Up 
 football pitches by the South Cerney Football Club which the Parish Council 
 totally supported. Although currently there was no lease, the football club 
 used the area with the full permission and encouragement of the Parish Council. 
 Mr. Stratford had informed the Chairman that his letter had been acceptable for 
 the purpose of applying for grant funding to the Football Association.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">CLLR PARSONS’ (GCC) REPORT</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Chairman Cllr Stuart invited Cllr Parsons (GCC) to make his 
 report as he had other meetings to attend that evening.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Sewage Problems<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">Cllr Parsons began by 
 saying that although he was not directly responsible for sorting out the 
 problem he had become involved because the highway had been damaged and he was 
 quite happy to continue. All that can be done at the moment is to bring 
 pressure on Thames Water, he said. After discussions Thames Water had agreed to 
 cease monitoring the situation and investigate the cause of the recent sewerage 
 calamity in Station Road. Cllr Parsons gave a short history of the breakdowns 
 in the system from July 2004 to the present day. After this meeting he would be 
 writing to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP asking him to inform the Chief Executive 
 Officer at Thames&nbsp; Water about the current problems being experienced by 
 South Cerney residents. Rob Bull (CDC) will be liaising with Thames Water on 
 behalf of CDC.</font></p>
 <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Mrs. Clark (CDC) reported that she would be seconding a 
 motion which would be proposed by Cllr Bennett (CDC) at the next meeting of the 
 Cotswold District Council.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Nicholas informed the Parish Council that the situation 
 which had developed in Station Road was fundamentally different to the flooding 
 which had occurred previously. This current problem was to do with the rising 
 main sewerage pipe which took sewage to Shorncote through a 12 inch diameter 
 pressurised pipe and this had failed.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Squire agreed with Cllr Stuart who stated that the main 
 sewerage pipe was nearly 50 years old and conversations with various people 
 indicated that the pipe would probably require renewing in the near future.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Nicholas asked Cllr Parsons (GCC) to inform Geoffrey 
 Clifton-Brown MP that the malodorous stench in the dwellings in Kingfisher 
 Place was continuing to cause concern to the residents. Cllr Parsons (GCC) 
 agreed.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Webb complained that the long awaited report from Thames 
 Water on the previous flood was still not forthcoming. Cllr Nicholas explained 
 that the breakage in the pressurised rising main was totally different from the 
 fiasco Cllr Webb was referring to and specific conditions needed to be in place 
 before a conclusion could be ascertained by Thames Water engineers.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Parsons (GCC) noted that sewage from new developments like 
 the Four Seasons hotel and the Jeremy Paxton development at Lower Mill will 
 have their sewerage moved by tanker. He thought that this practice was a 
 worrying trend especially for the future.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Stuart seconded a vote of thanks on 
 behalf of the residents of the village to the personnel from GCC and CDC who 
 helped limit the consequent mess and distress of the burst main. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Mud on the highways</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Caunce asked if something could not be done to keep the 
 highway leading to Cerney Wick from the Spine Road clean. Cllr Parsons (GCC) 
 said that it was time to test the protocol which had been agreed between the 
 parties responsible for keeping the highway clear and asked the Clerk to inform 
 Martyn Summerell at GCC Highways Cotswold Division of all occurrences.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Parsons left the meeting at 8pm.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">CLERK’S REPORT</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">On Thursday 13th October I accompanied Cllr Stuart to the 
 presentation of the Bledisloe Awards at Stanway House, Winchcombe.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Yesterday afternoon 8th November, I met with John Whittaker GCC 
 Highways, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire to confirm the exact positioning of the 
 interactive speed signs which should be installed shortly. Notification of the 
 change in speed limits from Silver Street to Preston Toll Bar will be 
 promulgated on the 10th November and if no objections are received by 1st 
 December their change will take place after then. Consultations are continuing 
 regarding the positioning of the pedestrian crossing in High Street. Due to 
 residents’ objections it will be suggested that the crossing point is moved 
 closer to the junction of Clarks Hay and Station Road.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">During October I averaged 4 hours 53 minutes per available 
 working day. It is difficult to allocate a precise daily average as some two 
 and a half days were spent at the SLCC annual conference which technically is 
 classed as training.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 7th November.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cerney Wick Lane<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">Cllr Caunce reported 
 an accumulation of dirt on the lane through lorries using Lakes 10 and 11. The 
 problem was being exacerbated because the lane was so narrow that when two 
 lorries passed each other the edges of the road bank were being damaged. This 
 has had the effect of compromising the drainage of the lane. The Clerk was 
 asked to report to the Enforcement Officer (CDC) that there was no wheel wash 
 installed at Lake 10.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Advertising Signs<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">No reply had been 
 received from Mrs. G. Portlock (GCC Highways) regarding the proliferation of 
 advertising signs throughout the village.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Tarmac<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">No quote had been 
 received from Mr. Francis for tarmacing the car park at Upper Up. In the 
 absence of any further quotes the Committee agreed to postpone any further 
 action until spring time.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">360 deg Swing<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">No copy 
 correspondence had been received from Steve Griffiths of Macventure Play Co. 
 The Clerk was asked to contact him for an update.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Interactive Speed, Fixed Speed Signs and Zebra Crossing<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">The Clerk reported 
 that a meeting had been arranged with John Whittaker, GCC Highways for 3pm on 
 Tuesday 8th November at the junction of Silver Street and Northmoor Lane to 
 discuss outstanding matters.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Robert Franklin Way Slide<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">Cllr Harris reported 
 that his contact was no longer interested in the stainless steel slide. Cllr 
 Stuart offered to negotiate with Steve Hanson of the Community Payback team if 
 it was possible for them to remove and dispose of the structure. No offers had 
 been forthcoming to aid its removal. Cllr Squire will ask Hills if it might 
 supply a skip to remove the concrete from the base.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Paxton Hedge<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">The Clerk had been 
 informed by GCC Highways on Friday 4th November that it would be writing to Mr. 
 Paxton regarding his hedge. If it was not cut back within two weeks then the 
 matter would be passed to the County Solicitor for action.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Harris reported that the remains of the strimming in the 
 bottom of the ditch in Station Road would decay naturally and presented no 
 immediate problem.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart also reported that Mike Barton GCC PROW had not yet 
 been able to arrange a meeting with Ben Knight to discuss the creation of the 
 cycle path along the old canal from South Cerney to Siddington.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Jay complained that GCC Highways was applying its usual 
 creeping forgetfulness<font size="1"> </font>regarding a response to the 
 Clerk’s enquiry about unauthorised advertising signs in the village. The Clerk 
 reported that Cllr Bennett (CDC) had informed him that he had spoken to various 
 officers at CDC and told them to make approaches to Thames Water to get 
 something done to solve the sewerage problem. He would be tabling a motion (no 
 pun intended) at the next full council meeting. Cllr Mrs. Clark (CDC) will 
 second the motion. They were calling on Thames Water to take urgent action to 
 rectify the problems with sewers in South Cerney to prevent any more instances 
 of untreated sewage washing into peoples properties, public highways and other 
 areas. He would like to go further and call for a ban on further development 
 until the sewers are replaced but does not think that would get through, and it 
 was better to get what you can, rather than nothing of what you want. He also 
 congratulated CDC staff who on Sunday, 23rd October, once they were informed of 
 the problem they had sandbags protecting threatened houses within less than an 
 hour.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart was informed by a local resident that Thames Water 
 was aware that the life expectancy of the main sewer to Shorncote was exhausted 
 and is now due for replacement. This would be a major undertaking as the sewer 
 was very deep in places.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">INSPECTION REPORTS</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cerney Wick play area</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Caunce reported no problems with the equipment. He would 
 inform the new Chair of Cerney Wick Village Committee Mrs. Kerry Bamford that 
 the hedge needed to be cut back. The new safety surface had been installed.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Upper Up play area</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart reported that the new safety surface had been 
 installed and alterations to the slide had been carried out. On inspection 
 minor adjustments had been recommended by Mr. John Hicks which the installers 
 had agreed to carry out in the next few days. The Committee recommend to the 
 Finance Committee that payment for the work be made as soon as it has been 
 satisfactorily completed. The CCTV camera would be removed in the next few 
 days. Overall, Cllr Stuart noticed a marked reduction in bad behaviour in the 
 neighbourhood of its coverage. Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart agreed that the 
 grass on the playing fields would need another cut. The Committee agreed to 
 recommend the action to the Finance Committee. The Community Payback team has 
 started cutting the hedge at the west end of the cricket field to open up a 
 vista.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Robert Franklin Way play area</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Harris reported that there was no equipment problems. Cllr 
 Harris asked that signs be erected to prevent dog owners using the enclosed 
 toddlers play area to secure their animals while supervising their children on 
 the rest of the play area. An old hazardous ash trunk needs to be removed.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest and left the room.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Stuart that 
 James Harris Contracting removes the old ash trunk for £50. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Harris returned to the meeting.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Clerk was asked to provide two “No Dogs” signs to be placed 
 on the fence surrounding the toddlers play area.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">FINANCE<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">Due to Cllr Smith’s 
 absence, Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which 
 had met on 9th November.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jubilee Gardens Offer<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">The Clerk was asked 
 to ascertain from CDC its intentions regarding the offer from the Parish 
 Council to purchase the public space at Jubilee Gardens because the ground 
 maintenance budget for next year would have to be increased if it agreed to 
 transfer the land to the Parish Council. Cllr Mrs. Clark (CDC) had spoken to 
 the CDC Chief Executive Officer Mr. Bob Austin who was not adverse to the idea. 
 The portfolio holder at CDC would be asked to reply to the Clerk.</p>
 </font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT" COLOR="#231f20"><b>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Outstanding Debt<br>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">The Finance Committee 
 was pleased that its strategy in achieving full payment of an outstanding debt 
 which had reached a satisfactory conclusion and congratulated the Clerk on his 
 perseverance.</p>

 Construction of an office building for the use of Watermark in 
 association with their surrounding leisure facilities at Lake 11 Cotswold Water Park, 
 South Cerney (R)<br>
 The new access at the south eastern side of the site is 
 directly opposite the entrance to Lake 9 access to which is usually locked. Vehicles using Lake 9 cause 
 an obstruction while unlocking their entrance gate. If permission granted traffic leaving Lake 
 11 should only turn right. The bund on the south eastern side should NOT be removed. It 
 provides a sound barrier to residents of Cerney Wick from traffic noise on the B4696 (Spine 
 Road). The proposal that the sewerage system joins the main drainage 
 system to Shorncote when this will not cope was clearly demonstrated recently by recent 
 events when the system broke down in Station Road, South Cerney and the road, open ditch and 
 other drains were flooded by raw sewage, in two if not three separate incidents, on 
 different days. The road junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Station Road (South 
 Cerney) and the B4696 (Spine Road) should be redesigned to accept the inevitable traffic 
 increase. The junction should be fundamentally improved and upgraded with better 
 illumination/traffic lights in the interests of safety.<br>

 to the colour or texture of the concrete roofing tiles or walls.<br>

 attended at Duke of Gloucester Barracks on 18th October 2005.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">“As agreed, I represented the Parish Council at the above 
 meeting, which had been setup as a “joint initiative” by the Environmental Officer of the CDC 
 (Mr. Ray Brassington) and the 29 Regt RLC.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">All local Parish and Town Councils in the area affected by the 
 aircraft had been invited to attend but only three parish representatives turned up. They 
 included myself plus one from Driffield with Harnhill and one representing three of the 
 Ampneys. Cirencester sent apologies but none of the other villages replied. Anne Clark 
 and Clive Bennett were also there as Ward Councillors. Three executive officers from CDC, 
 one newspaper reporter plus four army personnel and one minutes secretary made up the 
 assembly.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">After the welcome and introductions were made Col. McKend 
 volunteered to take the chair and set out the purpose of the meeting. He suggested that 
 future meetings be held at six monthly intervals but that representation be limited to elected 
 councillors, which meant that representatives of the complainants would be excluded. Ray 
 Brassington felt that there should be a place for reps of the complainants but he was 
 outnumbered. I asked if I could read the prepared statement at that juncture rather than wait 
 until nearly the end of the agenda, as our council is opposed to the formation of the ALM. 
 Although this request was refused, the message had got through to the meeting and there 
 was a marked change in the attitude in several of the delegates.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Col. McKend gave a top class presentation on the role of the 
 Silver Stars within the Regiment. By doing so he appeared to alter the views held by 
 the councillors from the other two villages who had no idea that others than the Silver Stars 
 used Cerney airfield for parachuting. Their main cause for complaint was the noise from 
 the other planes such as the Skyvan used by the paras. etc</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Considerable discussion on the flight paths took place but I 
 believe that the Army finally convinced every one that these routes were the only ones 
 available to minimise the noise and that at times they had to be altered due to prevailing winds 
 etc.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Colonel confirmed that he requests other users should 
 adhere to the flight pattern used by the Silver Stars but has no overall control. The use of the 
 Sky Van is beyond his and this committee’s remit.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">I then read the statement on behalf of this Council and it was 
 well received by most present.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">We then discussed the methods of dealing with complaints and RB 
 suggested that the Army set up a system to record all such calls and letters listing 
 when they had been received, from whom, and what action had been taken. He was told that such a 
 system had been in operation for many years. I took the opportunity of asking RB 
 how he recorded all complaints he received and if he could tell us how many such 
 calls he had recorded in the previous twelve months. He initially ignored this request and 
 went off at a tangent. I waited until he had finished and I said that I was still awaiting a 
 reply to my question that he had ignored. He then shuffled his pile of papers pulled out some 
 maps on which were a series of yellow spots. He explained that whenever he received a 
 complaint about the aircraft noise he marked the position of the complainant's home on the map. No 
 names, addresses, phone numbers. I counted these yellow spots and suggested that 
 perhaps 23 complaints from an area with a population of over 48000 was insufficient to 
 warrant such a time consuming exercise as he had arranged for today. His colleague then 
 suggested that although there were only 23 individual complaints, there could be at least one 
 other in each household who also were upset by the noise! Cllr Clive Bennett suggested that 
 there could be as many as four in each house but even then there would be less than 100 
 complainers!</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">RB would not accept that anyone should be precluded from being 
 able to complain and that all who phoned the camp should be advised that they should 
 contact then – local parish council. I disagreed and stated that all complaints should be 
 directed to the CDC and to Mr. B in particular.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">The meeting continued for just over two hours and at the end. 
 Col. McKend suggested that perhaps future meetings should be held every twelve months, not 
 six monthly as originally suggested. All except RB and his colleague agreed to this. RB 
 requested that we could call an extraordinary meeting in the period up to the next scheduled 
 meeting if a need arose.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Minutes of the meeting are being sent to all representatives 
 and as soon as these are received they will be included in the usual correspondence section of 
 our agenda for the next meeting.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">I think the meeting was a useful exercise but we should now 
 officially/formally write to both the Colonel and to the CDC suggesting that the entire scheme is 
 unnecessary and should be abandoned.”</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Stuart then read a response to Ms. Cooksley’s letter and 
 asked the assembled Parish Councillors for their approval.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that 
 the Parish Council totally supports the content of the letter and the actions of the 
 Chairman. It also agrees that no further meetings of the Airfield Liaison Committee are 
 necessary and we should inform the authorities concerned that we recommend that the Aircraft 
 Liaison Group be disbanded. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">COTSWOLD WATER PARK LIAISON COMMITTEE REPORT</p>
 </b></font><font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Webb gave his report on the Cotswold Water Park Liaison 
 meeting he attended at&nbsp; Keynes Country Park on 12th October 2005.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">The meeting elected members to the Liaison Committee. Cllr Webb 
 informed the Parish Council that eventually the footprint of the Water Park would 
 extend as far as Fairford. Officers of the Society were confident that the Limited Company 
 was financially secure and support was expected from the Regional Development Authority. 
 The mineral extraction rights would last for the next 40 years. There was confusion 
 over the title Cotswold Water Park which is fundamentally different to the Cotswold Water 
 Park Society Ltd.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Harris interjected disingenuously that as there were less 
 and less opportunities for the public to use the water facilities through the private 
 development of the lakes maybe a more appropriate title might be “The Pits”.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Webb volunteered to attend further meetings of the Liaison 
 Committee on behalf of the Parish Council.</p>
 <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Chairman thanked Cllr Webb for attending the meeting.</p>
