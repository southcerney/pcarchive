 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had apologised for his absence, Cllr Bennett 
 (CDC) apologised as he was attending another meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CO-OPTION OF A NEW MEMBER TO THE PARISH COUNCIL</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart drew attention to Standing Orders 58 and 59 
 which dealt with members and candidates’ interests and relationships with 
 elected members of the Parish Council. Cllr Nicholas carefully explained to 
 assembled Parish Councillors the implications of their having personal and/or 
 prejudicial interests in a subject under discussion by the Parish Council. 
 Overall the Code of Conduct took precedence over Standing Orders. The following 
 Parish Councillors declared personal interests: Cllr Harris as a friend of 
 John-Charles Kimberley; Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had a family 
 interest in Chris Jeffery; Cllr Mrs Land was an associate of Valerie Beddoe-Sims. 
 With the exception of Cllr Mrs Tunbridge who declared a prejudicial interest as 
 Chris Jeffery was her son-in-law, the other councillors declaring a personal 
 interest did not have a prejudicial interest in any candidate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge then left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk then read the statements given by all 
 candidates. There was no discussion as all Parish Councillors were already 
 aware of the candidates’ presentations. The Clerk distributed 8 ballot papers, 
 one to each Parish Councillor, asking them to vote for one candidate only. Cllr 
 Messenger (CDC) scrutinised the collected votes the outcome being 6 votes for 
 John Charles Kimberley and 2 for Chris Jeffery. John-Charles Kimberley was 
 therefore duly co-opted on to the Parish Council. The Clerk will inform all 
 candidates of the result and thank them for their participation and interest. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb left the meeting after the result of the vote 
 had been announced. <br>
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge returned to the room.</p>

 10th DECEMBER 2008</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2491<b> INSPECTION REPORTS, Robert Franklin Way</b> – 
 First line: delete Chub and insert Chubb </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no matters arising that were not dealt with 
 through the reports of the Committees.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 15th December I attended a follow up meeting of 
 the Youth Group in the Village Hall. 15 people attended the meeting and 
 discussions centred on the provision of premises suitable for all youngsters in 
 the village. Cllr Bennett (CDC) explained the situation regarding the Scout Hut 
 and had emailed members the outcome of his discussions with CDC planners. The 
 group would await the result of Ian Kennedy’s dialogue with the Scout 
 Association before it would meet again. Other venues were debated and various 
 options would be considered. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 16th December I attended a meeting of the Play 
 Portfolio group at CDC. Rosemary Lynn was concerned that no certification of 
 completion had been lodged. I explained that the Parish Council would supply 
 one when it was satisfied with the completion. Cllr Stuart would provide her 
 with the monitoring figures on usage in the near future. In April the Play 
 Rangers will hold some sessions of their activities in South Cerney as an 
 example of what they provide. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 19th December I attended a meeting of the 
 Chartered Parishes group held at the Fire Station, Barnwood, Gloucester. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 2nd January I attended a meeting of the Precept 
 Committee where the budget for April 2009-March 2010 was discussed. 
 Recommendations will be put to this meeting for consideration and approval. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During December of the 21 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 56 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; 
 PLAYING FIELDS COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 5th JANUARY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart 
 and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr Stuart had opened the meeting 
 at 7.05pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had made an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2490 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards.</b> CDC 
 Planners had informed the Clerk that planning permission was not necessary to 
 erect a bus shelter. The Clerk confirmed that he had asked six contractors for 
 a cost to design and build a shelter in reconstituted Cotswold stone. A 
 deadline of January 31st 2009 had been given for responses. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2491 – <b>“Shorncote Link”</b>. Cllr Stuart reported 
 that he had been informed by the contractor installing the bridge, that a 
 representative from Murphy had stated that when they upgraded the footpath 
 across the playing fields Murphy would complete the pathway to the new bridge 
 including the construction of the required ramp. Cllr Stuart had contacted 
 Stuart Milsom (MAI) and asked him to have Thames Water agents’ Bruton Knowles 
 confirm that the path will be made good. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had spoken to Mrs Ruth Berry who was quite 
 amiable to the suggestion that we work jointly on the plan to divert the 
 footpath to the other side of the hedge which divides her land from the playing 
 fields. Other refinements to the PROWs which cross the playing field could also 
 be redefined or extinguished by the creation of a substitute pathway. Cllr 
 Stuart suggested that negotiations on the footpaths should proceed with GCC 
 PROW. Cllr Harris stated that now was the time to also formalise other paths in 
 the parish. He quoted, for example, the steps to the old railway line in the 
 Bow Wow. In his experience it would reduce the costs if a series of plans could 
 be “piggy-backed”. Cllr Stuart said that he would liaise with Mike Barton and 
 Phil Cluley regarding the changes to the pathways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Harris that 
 contact be re-established with the new person at Aggregate Industries who had 
 taken over from Robert Westell. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2492 – <b>“Councillors’ Reports”</b>. Regarding 
 negotiations with Mr Mould over the installation of a light near to the wooden 
 bridge in Bow Wow leading to Box Bush, Cllr Harris stated that it was important 
 Mr Mould should not have a veto on any decision. Cllr Harris went on to say 
 that notice should be taken of any suggestion Mr Mould might make regarding the 
 installation. The Clerk will contact Mr Barry Greenaway at GCC to find out if 
 there were suitable low height level lights available.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chapman had made the report to the Clerk on behalf of Cllr Caunce as 
 he was otherwise engaged. The playground was all in order although there were 
 excess leaves which need to be cleared.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge made the report. The front play surface 
 of the Train Unit could be a trip hazard. Cllr Harris will write a 
 specification and email it to the Clerk for inclusion with the previous one 
 dealing with other safety surface problems on the play area. There were small 
 holes in the high fence on the Lakeside boundary, opposite the houses 
 overlooking the area. Cllr Harris reported that he had “darned” the holes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart made the report. Generally the playing fields are in good order. 
 The Cycle Mounds were well used over the Christmas period. The area is 
 generally tidy with the exception of a few timber pallets which are used by 
 riders as ramp extensions. Park Leisure Ltd has completed correction work to 
 both pieces but still have to re-do the surface behind the shelter. Work on the 
 football pavilion renovation is proceeding with the roof cladding fitted in the 
 past week. Movement of vehicles to and from the site has resulted in some 
 rutting to the grass surface. The new bridge at the far end of the new path has 
 been fitted and now in use. It is an excellent job. Drainage is required to the 
 area of the path near the river.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that five quotations for the ground 
 maintenance contract had been received. From the analysis it was agreed that 
 three contractors should be contacted to ascertain if they would be willing to 
 share parts of the work for which they had made the most competitive quotation, 
 on condition that they additionally quote for the jobs in Cerney Wick. The 
 third contractor should be offered that part of the contract for which he had 
 given the lowest quote. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After further analysis the Parish Council agreed with the 
 Clerk that only the two contractors with the lowest quotations should be 
 contacted. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As there was correction work needed to the surrounding 
 surface of the youth shelter, the Committee had recommended that £2,000 is 
 withheld from the payment to Park Leisure Ltd. To compensate the Parish Council 
 for the length of time taken to make good the equipment and to show good faith, 
 Park Leisure should be asked to paint court markings on the basketball side of 
 the kick wall.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the cover of the bin in Bow Wow 
 was still missing. The Clerk had notified Jack Austin (CDC). Cllr Jay stated 
 that the cover had since been replaced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris queried why at the entrance to Bow Wow orange 
 plastic barriers were necessary and why the wall was not rebuilt to its 
 original height. The Clerk will enquire from Dave Ludford at the Environment 
 Agency. Cllr Harris requested that the questions also be referred to 
 Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris queried if something could be done to move the 
 service pipe which crosses the river Churn, located up river from the Village 
 Hall in School Lane in the vicinity of Brook House adjacent to Churn Cottage. 
 The Clerk will enquire from Dave Ludford at the Environment Agency. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to enquire from CDC if an 
 applicant applied for permission to show an advertisement for 2 years, when the 
 maximum allowed was 5 years, did the permission expire after the requested 
 length of time or when the maximum period elapsed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that he had noted a sewage leak 40 
 metres from the metal gates leading into Lakeside car park on the village side 
 of Station Road. The Clerk will notify the Environment Health office at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart requested the Clerk to ask Scottish &amp; Southern 
 Power Distribution for a definitive reply as to why parts of South Cerney were 
 losing electric power on an increasingly regular basis. The Clerk will write to 
 the Restoration Manager at the Swindon Department of Scottish &amp; Southern 
 Electric Distribution, Faraday Road, Dorcan, Swindon SN3 5EY. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that the grille on the open drain in 
 Station Road, near to the Piece, was two-thirds full and needed to be cleared. 
 The Clerk will inform Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart had closed the 
 meeting at 8.35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY
 5th JANUARY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.35pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb had made an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Betec Joinery Ltd</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that Betec Joinery Ltd had carried out the further work on 
 the noticeboard at Clarks Hay.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spreadsheet Analysis <br>
 </b>With three quarters of the period completed, the expenditure detailed on 
 the spread sheet was generally within budget.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendation for acceptance from the Playing Fields &amp; 
 Village Maintenance Committee<br>
 </b>As there was correction work needed to the surrounding surface of the youth 
 shelter the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee had recommended 
 that £2,000 is withheld from the payment to Park Leisure Ltd. To compensate the 
 Parish Council for the length of time taken to make good the equipment and to

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had inspected the invoices and agreed the Clerk’s

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land 
 that the Parish Council agrees to make the payments recommended by the Finance 
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PRECEPT PROPOSALS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee agreed to make minor alterations to 
 the draft Capital Budget by sharing the amount for Village Plan projects with a 
 grant to the Football Club for £5,000. The £1,000 for Heritage Buildings &amp; 
 Monuments in the Capital Replacement Funds was cut and the projected interest 
 from investments was reduced to £1,000. Cllr Jay stated that the commitment to 
 Village Plan projects was secured. Cllr Nicholas noted that the total planned 
 expenditure for the coming year was £1,020 less than last year’s and could have 
 been greater if interest rates had not fallen so precipitously. The increase on 
 a band “D” property was a modest 19p per annum. The precept demand remained as 
 agreed by the Precept Committee. Cllr Jay commended the budget and recommended 
 that it is accepted by the Parish Council. Cllr Nicholas proposed and Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge seconded a motion that the Parish Council agrees to the budget 
 deliberations. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
