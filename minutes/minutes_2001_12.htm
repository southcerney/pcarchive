    </center></div><p align="left">Dr S. Pickering from the Cotswold Water Park Society gave a
    talk to assembled Parish Councillors on the types of funding available for nature
    conservation and provision of green spaces. There were various grants ranging from £3,000
    to £25,000 and one up to £100,000 which could help communities provide a biodiversity
    habitat for wildlife sustainability. Dr Pickering would be willing to give guidance to the
    Parish Council on how to apply for available grants. Cllr Harris asked if the old silt
    beds to the rear of the CAMAS site would be a suitable area for funding. Dr Pickering
    considered that it was suitable and an ideal scheme for match funding. Cllr Nicholas asked
    if the Cotswold Water Park Society would be prepared to manage the site on behalf of the
    Parish Council. Dr Pickering replied that the CWP would be interested and the management
    could be funded from any commuted fund which might be gained from the developers. Dr
    Pickering confirmed that he could carry out a water vole survey of the Upper Ups and Downs
    which the Environment Agency had asked for. Cllr Mrs Gardiner suggested that the site be
    renamed Jubilee Park and this was received enthusiastically by some Parish Councillors
    although no decision had yet been taken on a title.<br>
    <br>
    One member of the public attended the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    The Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner opened the meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    There was an apology from Cllr Parsons (GCC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PARISH COUNCILLOR CO-OPTION</strong><br>
    Simon King introduced himself with a brief resumé of his career to date. He has lived in
    South Cerney for seven years and is a director of a training centre in Cirencester
    involved in health and safety. He is also a practising agriculturist. After his speech he
    was asked to leave the meeting while the Parish Councillors discussed his co-option. It
    was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council co-opted
    Mr King as a Parish Councillor. The Parish Council was all in favour. Cllr King rejoined
    the meeting and was introduced by Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner to the rest of the Parish
    Council.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PARTY INVITATION</strong><br>
    Mrs D. Land invited Parish Councillors to attend a OCrack Party' on 16 December 2.30pm to
    4pm at her home in 5 Berkeley Close to commemorate the first anniversary of the village
    floods. Mrs Land then left the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Gardiner that the Minutes were a true
    and accurate record. The Parish Council agreed, with the exception of Cllr King and the
    Minutes were signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    3 members of the public joined the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village Floods</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner had discussions with Mrs Robinson on the weir which had been erected
    near the bridge in Clarks Hay. Copies of correspondence from CDC and the Environment
    Agency in reply to Mrs Robinson had been received by the Parish Council. The Clerk was
    asked to inform Mrs Robinson that the Parish Council shared her concern.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Scrap Engine in Silver Street</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that a resident intended to remove the engine.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hunter Page Planning Meeting</strong><br>
    Parish Councillors with the exception of Cllr Mrs Chapman and Cllr Mrs Pearse attended a
    meeting on 20 November with Paul Fong of HPP and David Parker of Pioneer, a specialist in
    affordable housing. CDC will insist that the area is restored to a greenfield site and
    planning permission would be refused. HPP disagree with CDC and will appeal against their
    decision on the grounds of non-determination. The Parish Council would welcome a meeting
    with officers of the CDC planning authority to discuss the implications and reasoning
    behind their decision. The Parish Council hoped that District Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) and
    Cllr L. Jones (CDC) would also attend the meeting. In the meantime the Clerk would ask
    Marcus Kitchen for a better understanding of the position taken by CDC on the application
    and the implications of policy issues on the Local Plan. In view of the controversy
    between the CDC and Westbury Homes over the planning application Cllr Mrs Spriggs agreed
    with the decision of Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) and Cllr L. Jones (CDC) not to attend the
    meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 10
    December.<br>

    Outline application for the erection of a bungalow at Hailwood, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/L<br>
    Amendment to application for Lodge 20 Lakes 4 &amp; 5 Spine Road Cllr Nicholas asked that
    this decision be ratified as the Committee did not have the benefit of the Parish
    Council¹s input due to the time restraint imposed. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/R<br>
    Relocation of 28 lodges on previously approved development of holiday lodges at Lake 7,
    Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.3239/K<br>
    Erection of a new garage at Orchard House, Cerney Wick, Cirencester The proposed
    application could not be considered as just a garage as it is for a 2 storey building. The
    building is inappropriate as it is too close to existing boundary. Cllr Nicholas asked
    that this decision be ratified as the Committee did not have the benefit of the Parish
    Council's input due to the time restraint imposed. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    OBJECTION although permission had already been granted<br>
    <br>
    CT.3377/C<br>
    Demolition of existing of Plymouth Brethren Chapel and construction of building to create
    a new dwelling at The Cottage, High Street, South Cerney Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr
    Gardiner declared an interest and left the meeting while the rest of the Parish Council
    discussed the application. The Committee agreed that the design of the building
    sympathetically echoed the existing building.<br>
    NO OBJECTION. The Parish Council was all in favour<br>
    <br>
    CT.4454/G<br>
    The erection of an extension at Quarry Farm, Cricklade Road, South Cerney, Cirencester GL7
    5QE<br>
    NO OBJECTION although permission had already been granted<br>
    <br>
    CT.4762/C<br>
    Amended plans for proposed extension to existing dwelling, new detached garage and
    alterations to existing boundary wall at Lane End, Latton Close, Station Road, South
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.5790/J<br>
    Conservatory at 3 Hambledon Close, South Cerney Cllr Nicholas asked that this decision be
    ratified as the Committee did not have the benefit of the Parish Council¹s input due to
    the time restraint imposed. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    OBJECTION although permission had already been granted<br>
    <br>
    CT.6074/P<br>
    Two storey extension to the existing dwelling at Riverside Cottage, School Lane, South
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8163/B<br>
    Additional information only on erection of two detached two storey dwellings at Orchard
    House, Upper Up, South Cerney<br>
    OBJECTION. No response form had been received and the Clerk was asked to object by letter
    to the revised plans.<br>
    <br>
    CT.8184<br>
    Two storey extension at 17 Broadway Lane, South Cerney, Cirencester The property is set in
    a row of similar, modest semi-detached houses on one side of the road and the proposed
    development would be inappropriate at this location. The design, and in particular the
    size of the proposed development in relation to the size of the whole site, would have a
    detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and on the
    surrounding area. The front elevation of the proposed extension would destroy the rhythm
    of a row of regular semi-detached properties, and set an undesirable precedent. Cllr
    Nicholas asked that this decision be ratified as the Committee did not have the benefit of
    the Parish Council¹s input due to the time restraint imposed. The applicant, Mrs Musto,
    spoke in defence of the application and the members of the public agreed to leave the
    meeting while the Parish Council voted. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded
    by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council object to the application. After a vote 5 Parish
    Councillors were in favour of objecting, 1 against with 5 abstentions the Parish Council
    agreed to object. The members of the public rejoined the meeting and were informed of the
    decision and the Clerk was to write to Mrs Musto giving the reasons for the objection.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee with the exception of
    CT.3377/C and to ratify the decisions taken on CT.1454/3/L, CT.3239/K, CT.5790/J,
    CT.6074/P and CT.8184. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    past practice had been to refuse this contribution and she recommended that this procedure
    be continued. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish
    Council refuse their share of the Cutts Charity money. The Parish Council was all in
    favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 10 December.<br>

    Disabled Access at Upper Up</strong><br>
    The Clerk was to contact T. Sibbick and ask him when he intended to start construction of
    the Disabled Access at Upper Up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CCTV Survey</strong><br>
    Three Counties Drainage Services carried out a CCTV survey of the drain between the Old
    Police Station on Station Road to west of the Langet. A more detailed study would require
    the drain to be cleaned by pressure jet. The Clerk will arrange to have a copy of the
    video made which will then be passed to D. Taylor GCC Highways. Cllr Stuart will confer
    with D. Taylor as to who might be responsible for further exploration and the probable
    repair and maintenance of the drain.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lines on Basketball area at Upper Up</strong><br>

    <br>
    <strong>Bledisloe Cup Competition</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart attended the presentation ceremony on 5 December held at the
    Millennium Hotel in London. South Cerney was awarded a prize of £250 and a plaque as
    regional winners for the South West and Western England in the Older People Care Award
    category.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bledisloe Cup Prizes</strong><br>
    It was agreed at the last Parish Council meeting to present the Gardening Club with the
    £100 received for winning the Bledisloe Cup for Best Kept Village to plant bulbs. As the
    Clerk had not yet contacted the Gardening Club Cllr Stuart suggested that they be asked
    where the bulbs should be planted. Cllr Gardiner suggested that the £250 award for
    regional winners be used to provide a concrete base for the seat at the junction of School
    Lane and Silver Street. Cllrs Gardiner, Harris and Stuart will inspect the seat area and
    recommend any improvements thought necessary. Cllr Stuart suggested that the award be
    discussed with the COSY Club and Helping Hands.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Inspection Report</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner carried out the playground inspections. He reported that a dead elm near to
    the swings in Cerney Wick play area was in danger of falling over the swings and should be
    removed. The Clerk was asked to contact Cotswold Water Park Society, Paul Ponting and
    Kevin Richings to quote for its removal. Leaves and other debris were accumulating on the
    safety tiles and needed sweeping off. Cllr Mrs Chapman volunteered to sweep the tiles. At
    Upper Up the seats on the senior swings would need replacing. Cllr Harris would carry out
    the next round of inspections.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MILLENNIUM PARK</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had met with Martin Portus. The Conservation Officer from the Environment
    Agency required a water vole survey of the site.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Style on BSC17</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart suggested that the vertical fence on BSC17 at the tunnel below railway
    embankment, midway between Bow Wow bridge and Silver Street, be upgraded to a style as
    walkers were having difficulty in using it in its present condition.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the new lights in Bow Wow and outside the Scout Hut had not yet
    been connected. The Clerk was asked to contact B. Greenaway regarding the installation of
    the experimental lights in Station Road and the provision of the extended arm on the
    footpath light between High Street and Meadow Way.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Broken Fence Rail at Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that a broken rail on the playing field fence at Upper Up had been
    removed. Cllr Harris volunteered to make the repair.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Overgrowing Limes</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that overgrowing lime trees near to the entrance of Orchard House,
    Upper Up to the playing field entrance are shrouding the light from the lamp posts on the
    north side. The Clerk was asked to contact D. Taylor GCC Highways.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Overgrowing Conifers</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported overgrowing conifers near to Cherry Orchard and the Ponderosa in the
    Langet were obscuring light from the lamp posts. Cllr Stuart would inform the residents.<br>
    <br>

    <br>

    held at the Millennium Hotel in London. On 8 December Cllr Mrs Spriggs attended a rally in
    support of Cirencester Hospital. On 11 December Cllr Mrs Spriggs attended a meeting of the
    Village Hall Committee. Cllr Mrs Spriggs reported that preparations which she considered
    Ohypothetical' were being made for the disposal of the Village Hall. Cllr Mrs Spriggs was
    concerned on how to gauge villagers' opinion and what was the view of the Parish Council.
    Cllr Stuart Chairman of the Village Hall Committee admitted that the Committee was hasty
    in raising the question of disposal but no vote on the sale had been taken. Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner said that it was good practice that a valuation of the asset be obtained. Cllr
    Mrs Chubb was reassured that no decision had been taken on the sale of the Village Hall.
    It was agreed to arrange a meeting with Rodney Vaughan of GRCC who was an expert on
    Village Hall matters with members of the Parish Council and as many Village Hall Committee
    Members as possible to see what the next steps should be.</p>
    <p align="left">There being no further business the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner closed
    the meeting at 10.20pm. </td>
