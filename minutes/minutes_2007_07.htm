    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart welcomed Ali Swainston, Head Ranger at the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd (CWPS). Mr Swainston stated that the car park at Lake 12 which was under the management of CWPS Ltd was long overdue for refurbishment. In order to control the industrial feeding of birds and other wildlife, signs and fences would be erected to help protect the lake which was classed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by Natural England. He estimated the cost of the project would be between £100-£150k. The existing car park was 350 metres long and the draft plan proposed to fence and gate the bottom half which was that piece towards the Spine Road. It was planned to create 40 car parking spaces in the remaining area and equip it with picnic furniture and other seats. Mature trees will be retained. Natural England has prohibited drainage of surface water into the lake to protect the SSSI. Double fences, one on the bank and the other in the water would prevent people and birds access to the water and banks in the short term until the plants became mature. So far, 75% of the money had been promised although the majority depended on match funding. Ali remained confident that the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund would be the source of the necessary funds. Cllr Mrs D. Land drew his attention to the need of disabled users, especially parking bays which should be tarmac. Cllr P. Jay stated that like the rest of the Parish Council he was embarrassed with the state of the car park and welcomed the excellent plan to renovate it. He suggested that funds might be applied for from the RSPB which would surely support the scheme. Parish Councillors were in agreement with Cllr P. Nicholas who suggested that the cycle path should include the “missing link” from the western end of the existing car park to the village boundary at the entrance to Robert Franklin Way. Ali agreed, but could not make any promises. Cllr Nicholas then suggested that it might be a project for Phase 2. Cllr J. Harris suggested in order to control movement within the car park only one entrance/exit is provided. Ali welcomed Parish Councillors to feel free to make further suggestions in the future. The Chairman thanked Ali Swainston for his attendance who then left the meeting.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2263 – <b>Overgrowing Hedges obscuring road signs,</b> 
 2nd line: delete … the hamlet of<br>
 Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that Cerney Wick was not a hamlet as 
 the description did not fit because, according to the Oxford Dictionary, a 
 hamlet was a small village, especially (in Britain) one without a church. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2266 – <b>CT.7528/C,</b> insert before the last line: 
 The Parish Council strongly objects to this application due to the very 
 considerable loss of privacy that would be caused to all adjoining properties </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the Minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge reported that the YPC had convened its first 
 annual general meeting. Although there was a full turn out by the members of 
 the YPC it was disappointing that only two others attended. Joe informed the 
 Parish Council that he had been elected Chairman as Rebecca Lodge was leaving 
 the YPC to attend university. Parish Councillors congratulated him on his 
 promotion. The YPC was worried about the effectiveness of the “curfew” if it 
 was to be introduced on the play areas. The YPC was taking part in the plans 
 for a MUGA (multi user games area) currently under discussion. Seven members 
 had attended a meeting to consider what it would comprise. It was decided that 
 a youth shelter on its own would not fit the needs of youth in South Cerney but 
 a half shelter combined with a MUGA would be welcomed. The plan would form part 
 of the bid by CDC for a portion of the Big Lottery Fund application. It was 
 envisaged that £20,000 would be allocated to various towns and villages for the 
 immediate use of youths in the age range 12-18. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce and Cllr Stuart had attended a briefing on the 
 bid at the Cotswold District Council offices and met with, among others, 
 equipment suppliers. Cllr Stuart explained that the plan was for a 40m long by 
 15/20m wide tarmac area with areas for football, basket ball activity and 
 skateboarding which he estimated would cost £15,000. The Pay Back in the 
 Community team would be prepared to supply labour for the ground works. Cllr 
 Caunce and Cllr Stuart would prepare a bid for funding which would be presented 
 to CDC by Monday 16th July. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The YPC members present were fully in favour of the 
 overall plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Aram (CDC) stated that she thought the plan a 
 brilliant idea but would be happier if there was lighting available. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) said that it was a good idea but he was 
 concerned with the consequences if the bid failed. Cllr Stuart assured him by 
 stating that the bid was not dependent on the grant. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Members of the Football Club present were also in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Jay 
 that the Parish Council agrees to put the scheme forward and apply for a £5,000 
 grant from CDC. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FOOTBALL CLUB DELEGATION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Chairman of the South Cerney Football Club Gordon 
 Stratford, Secretary Mrs Kay Allen and registered football coaches Gavin Jones 
 and Craig Sutherland came to the meeting to complain about the annoyance of dog 
 faeces on the Upper Up playing field but especially on the football pitches. 
 Mrs Allen disagreed with the content of a recent letter from the Parish Council 
 which stated that after an inspection by Cllr Stuart and two others only one 
 mess had been found which could have been either a fox or a dog. The delegation 
 insisted that something be done to stop or control residents using the play 
 areas to exercise their dogs. The parties agreed to a proposal from Cllr Caunce 
 who suggested that a joint team from the Football Club and the Parish Council 
 inspect the play areas to build evidence on the alleged problem between now and 
 the next meeting. Cllr Nicholas said that he understood the strength of feeling 
 but argued that the Parish Council was not pro-dogs. Discussions, he continued, 
 were on-going but enforcement of any order would be a problem. The PROW which 
 crossed the play area further complicated any restriction. It was agreed by all 
 that the situation affecting the football and cricket pitches was totally 
 different from that of the recreational area around the lake. It was agreed 
 that the problem is further discussed as an agenda item at next month’s 
 meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no matters arising which were not dealt with by 
 the relevant committee reports. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 15th June after a telephone conversation with 
 Dave Flagg, Gloucestershire Highways Signs &amp; Lines Technician I measured the 
 sign entering the village in preparation for a replacement one at Upper Up. Mr 
 Flagg informed me that GRP or a plastic substitute has proved unsuitable as it 
 is prone to fade and steel was the preferred material for sign construction 
 having a much less scrap value than aluminium. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The saga of the Open Ditch in Station Road continues. On 
 July 4th I requested a meeting with Karen James – Customer Relations, Thames 
 Water Utilities, to hopefully resolve the matter. This has since been refused 
 and Cllr Stuart agreed to liaise with Lawrence Adams to try and solve the 
 predicament.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During June, of the 11 available working days, I averaged 
 5 hours per day. This is way in excess of my contract because most of the time 
 was taken up preparing for and acting on Committee and Parish Council meetings 
 prior to a holiday break.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 9th July. Cllr Caunce, 
 Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart, Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker 
 attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>“Curfew” Restrictions</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris produced a recently erected sign which requested that the play area 
 at Robert Franklin Way not be used after 10pm. The sign had been maliciously 
 defaced and the Clerk was asked to arrange for its replacement. It was agreed 
 that the word “ORDER” is replaced with “REQUEST”.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Stop Signs <br>
 </b>The flag on the sign was still broken. The Clerk will inform Jonathan 
 Roberts at GCC Integrated Transport unit and ask for a replacement to be 
 fitted. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Jenny Elliott, Thames Water Customer Relations insisted that the ditch had been 
 cleared by its contractors. A request from the Clerk that a meeting takes place 
 to resolve the differences in opinion was rejected by Thames Water. Cllr Stuart 
 had discussed the dilemma with Lance Adams who is in charge of the current 
 reinstatement of the sewerage system in South Cerney. Mr Adams will contact Ms 
 Elliott and relay the reservations of the Parish Council which considered that 
 Thames Water had reneged on an agreement. If the matter remains unresolved Cllr 
 Nicholas will raise it at the next meeting he attends of the Flooding Forum 
 although he did praise Mr Adams whom he knew to be doing his best. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damaged Manhole Cover (outside “Content”)</b> <br>
 The Clerk had written to the occupants of “Content” about the damaged manhole 
 cover. Mrs Lugg had replied by telephone that she would contact Thames Water 
 and inform them that as the cover was outside the curtilage of the property she 
 was not responsible. Cllr Caunce volunteered to contact GCC Highways to discuss 
 the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damaged Manhole Cover (outside “Londis”)</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce will contact GCC Highways to discuss the repair. Cllr Stuart was 
 concerned that there could be an issue for the Environmental Health because of 
 the proximity of the manhole cover and a food outlet. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resiting of public seat at Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris confirmed that the seat had been installed at Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tower Slide Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart informed the Committee that Steve Hanson and his team from Pay Back 
 in the Community would start work on the reinstatement of the tower slide site 
 on Friday 13th. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Walker that 
 James Harris Contracting be awarded the reseeding of the site. The Committee 
 was in agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fenplay Safety Surface</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had accompanied George Taylor (Fenplay Ltd) when he inspected the 
 safety surface. Part of the damage would be covered by warranty although Mr 
 Taylor suspected that other damage to the edge had been caused by the grass 
 cutting contractors. Cllr Stuart reported that a quote for £50 had been 
 received for the supply of 16 bags of the special repair sand needed. The Clerk 
 was asked to inform Glebe contractors about the damage caused to the safety 
 surface. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Seating Audit</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce will arrange a party consisting of Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb to carry out a survey of the public seats and their condition. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Notice Boards</b> <br>
 The Clerk awaited a quotation from R.O.W. Berry for the rebuilding of the 
 notice board at the bus stop near to the Limes. Cllr Jay suggested that the 
 notice board in Clarks Hay also needed attention as the surface was peeling. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Sign</b> <br>
 The Clerk had emailed Dave Flagg, Signs &amp; Lines Technician at Gloucestershire 
 Highways with the words and size of type previously used on the missing sign. 
 Mr Flagg stated that a sign constructed from steel would be less attractive 
 financially to those intent on its theft. Mr Flagg had since confirmed that a 
 sign had been ordered at a cost to the Parish Council of £60. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn bank reinstatement</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris enquired if any update had been received from Ms Jennifer Watkins, 
 Gloucestershire Highways on plans to reinstate the bank of the river Churn 
 through Bow Wow. The Clerk reported that no update on her meeting of the 21st 
 June had been received and would request one. Ms Watkins had since emailed that 
 she was no longer involved with the scheme although she would pass on the 
 enquiry to her replacement Mr Chris Franklin. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow Tree Trunks</b> <br>
 Harris asked the Clerk to inform Ms Jennifer Watkins, Gloucestershire Highways 
 about the deterioration of the road side through Bow Wow because of obstructing 
 tree trunks and insist that action is taken to remove them. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shire Brook Blockage</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that although some bales had been removed from the river 
 at Upper Up, new ones were now in the Shire Ditch in the vicinity of Downs 
 Farm, Ashton Road. Cllr Stuart had reported the incident to the Environment 
 Agency and Cllr Harris had observed that work was proceeding to remove the 
 bales.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the playing field and equipment was all in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the latch on the gate of the toddlers play area had 
 been replaced. He detected movement at the base of the 360 degree swing and 
 asked colleagues to independently inspect the equipment and report their 
 opinion. The Committee agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Stuart that the Pay 
 Back in the Community Team be asked to dig out a foundation to clarify if 
 further action was needed to secure the support. All outstanding maintenance 
 previously requested had been carried out. The Clerk was asked to inform Glebe 
 Contractors that the grass around equipment in the Toddlers Play area had not 
 been cut properly. The Clerk was to ask for quotations to reduce the 
 overhanging branches to provide a 3m high clearance on the bridleway alongside 
 Ash Moon to facilitate the passage of horse riders and remove a broken branch 
 on the ground by the river Churn.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that repairs to the activity area had been completed 
 satisfactorily. The Clerk was asked to remind Glebe Contractors to strim the 
 grass and weeds on the cycle mounds. The tennis pavilion had been repaired 
 although some vandalism had been inflicted on equipment on the tennis court. 
 Murphy contractors were still using the access across the playing field and 
 despite the protective pathway, deep ruts had developed. The surface of the car 
 park was badly potholed but action to reinstate would have to wait until the 
 contractors had completed their operation. The Football Club, despite 
 reminders, had left black plastic rubbish bags at the entrance to the playing 
 field. A further reminder would be sent to the secretary. Cllr Stuart and two 
 others had walked the playing field looking for dog faeces but had found only 
 one piece which might have been that of a fox.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>JUBILEE GARDENS BOUNDARY PATH AND ACCESS TO HIGH STREET</b>
 <br>
 The Clerk was to ask Glebe Contractors to quote to remove the weeds from the 
 path surrounding Jubilee Gardens and how much extra would it cost to add it to 
 next year’s schedule. The Clerk was also to enquire how much it would cost to 
 tidy up the access footpath from Jubilee Gardens to High Street and add it to 
 the schedule as per the Millstream which was cut 6 (six) times a year. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MEADOW WAY TO HIGH STREET PROW</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to inform the owner of 6 Meadow Way that the hedge was 
 overgrowing the footpath to the side and rear of that property and causing 
 inconvenience to users. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in this item 
 as a potential contractor and left the room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>OVERGROWING SHRUB ON THE PIECE</b> <br>
 Three quotations had been received to remove the Russian Vine from The Piece on 
 Station Road. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Walker that 
 the Parish Council agreed the contract to remove the shrub be awarded to Dave 
 King who had quoted £90. Although the quote matched a verbal one from James 
 Harris Contracting it was decided to allocate the work to Mr King. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. Cllr Harris returned to the room. Cllr Caunce 
 explained the decision of the Committee. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that some of the lettering on the 
 VAS (Vehicle Activated Sign) in Silver Street was damaged. The VAS in Station 
 Road was flashing irregularly possibly due to overgrowing tree branches 
 interfering with the beam. The Clerk will report the incidents to 
 Gloucestershire Highways.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker enquired if there were sufficient signs on the 
 carriageways throughout the parish to notify road users of the possibility of 
 encountering wildlife. He recalled that an accident had been caused recently 
 when a motorist braked suddenly to avoid some ducks on the road and following 
 cars had collided. Cllr Harris informed him of various positions where such 
 signs were in place. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge complained about the number of pot 
 holes appearing on the roads throughout the village. Cllr Caunce explained that 
 as Gloucestershire Highways had noted the carriageway damage and encircled it 
 with white marker paint it could not be held responsible as it intended to 
 repair the holes eventually. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that the litter bin next to the seat in 
 Bow Wow was missing again. The Clerk will report the incident to Roger Sollis 
 at CDC and request that the bin, when replaced, is properly secured.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported on the discussions of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on 11th June. Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay enquired if a quotation had been received for the repair of the notice 
 board outside the Limes and added that the surface of the one in Clarks Hay was 
 peeling away. The Clerk explained that R.O.W. Berry was waiting for further 
 costs before he could finalise a price. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>OVERGROWING SHRUB ON THE PIECE</b> <br>
 Three quotations had been received to remove the Russian Vine from The Piece on 
 Station Road. <br>
 The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee had recommended that the 
 Finance Committee ratified its decision to award the contract to Dave King. The 
 Committee had no objection and will recommend that the Parish Council agrees to 
 its decision. Previously the Parish Council had agreed to the decision of the 
 Playing Fields and Village Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 item and left the room.</p>

 Committee which had met on 9th July. Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr 
 Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb attended the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2443/P and CT.2443/Q (Winchcombe Gardens)</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas enquired if a reply had been received 
 regarding the anomaly which exists between these two applications and the 
 assertion made by the Parish Council that it was not a signatory to any 
 agreement with Bloor Homes. The Clerk stated that the Enforcement Officer had 
 asked the legal department at CDC to investigate and was awaiting a reply. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/R and CT.2648/3/S (Lake 11 Wheel Washing 
 Conditions)</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb was disappointed with the reply received from 
 the Enforcement Officer considering the lack of implementation of Condition 23 
 on wheel washing facilities. The Committee agreed that it was a fruitless 
 exercise in trying to resolve the problem through communication with either 
 Ward Councillors or the Enforcement Officers. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated that overall the District 
 Council had looked at the implementation of Conditions but it had determined 
 that Conditions would be enforced if and when it was expedient to do so. The 
 Parish Council was asked to arrange a meeting with CDC Chief Executive Officer 
 Bob Austin, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb to discuss the implications of 
 Conditions attached to planning permissions and their lack of enforcement.</p>

 had been taken at the Planning Committee meeting. <br>
 After a discussion a vote was taken on how to determine the application by the

 Parish Council does not object to permission being granted for this

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.8631</b> <br>
 Erection of replacement agricultural building at Westdown Farm Buildings, 
 Cirencester Road, South Cerney <br>
 As the decision was contrary to the view expressed by the Parish Council the 
 following brief explanation was given. The building has been designed with 
 reference to typical Cotswold pitch and span. The building will be set back 
 from the road, with the gable end facing the road, and the land rises behind 
 the building. Officers do not consider that it will be detrimental to the 
 landscape. The materials of the building will be conditioned. The application 
 has been submitted as an agricultural building and is considered upon that 
 basis. Its use has been conditioned accordingly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION OF APPLICATIONS</b> <br>
 The Parish Council totally rejects the suggestion that applications are thus 
 delivered as it would be impractical in the extreme. It must be remembered that 
 not all Parish Councillors have access to a computer and copying facilities 
 would be necessary to provide a hard copy for reference. If a member of the 
 public requested to view a copy it would entail excessive management to provide 
 copies of any documents especially those larger than A4. The Clerk will notify 
 CDC of the Parish Council’s objection and concern to the proposed new 
 arrangement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ADVERTISEMENTS AUDIT</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb had carried out an audit of advertisements displayed at the Cerney 
 Wick Lane/Station Road/Spine Road junction. His conclusion was that all signs 
 have permission with the exception of one on Lake 10 (Waters Edge). The Clerk 
 was asked to write to Sean Hodgson at Waters Edge and request that he applies 
 for retrospective permission to display the advertisement. The Clerk was asked 
 to write to Bloor Homes and ask them to remove the yellow signs affixed to lamp 
 posts and other places throughout the village advertising Winchcombe Gardens.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.4498/W FOUR PILLARS HOTEL CONDITIONS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb was concerned that a Condition imposed which 
 would ease traffic flows to and from the entrance to the Four Pillars Hotel on 
 the Spine Road had not been implemented. Cllr Webb would research the planning 
 file to ascertain if his concern was justified and report his findings to the 
 Parish Council on Wednesday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb’s findings on traffic management at the entrance 
 to the site did not justify further action. Condition 24 of the application 
 did, however, stipulate that work should be carried out on the adjacent cycle 
 path. Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated that the District Council was aware of the non 
 compliance and discussions were on going to resolve the lapse.</p>

 involved in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme and asked if any tasks could be 
 provided. Cllr Stuart referred Cllr Caunce to Mrs Reta-May who may be able to 
 provide a suitable assignment. </p>
