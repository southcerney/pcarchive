    <b>CHAIRMAN’S REPORT</b><br>
    <br>
    2005 Parish Council Chairman's report<br>
    <br>
    After last Wednesday’s Parish Council meeting, Tony Squire, Peter Jay and I 
    stayed on in the Committee Room to put the final touches to our application 
    for the Village of the Year competition, all twenty two pages of it! This is 
    a national event with the first stage being in the competitor’s home county. 
    The winners of each county then go on to regional and hopefully, national 
    stages. In 2001 South Cerney won a South West regional prize and this year 
    we want to do as well if not better.</p>
    <p>My reason for telling you this is because when we had finished that 
    marathon bit of paper work, we all came to the conclusion that South Cerney 
    is a pretty darned good place to live in. The different things that go on in 
    this community, the number of people who give so much of their time, skills, 
    money, care and good old-fashioned love for their neighbours is wonderful. I 
    didn’t realise just how much good work there is until my two colleagues 
    brought their input to that form</p>
    <p>These past twelve months have been hectic and the next year seems to 
    going to be just as busy. Your Parish Council have been involved in 
    improving the village with projects such as the completion of the Robert 
    Franklin Way Playground; working with the young people in fine-tuning the 
    mountain bike track at Upper Up; planting some forty or more hardwood trees 
    in the village (most of which were purchased by individuals or families 
    wanting to commemorate someone or a special event); working with CDC on the 
    Jubilee Gardens People’s Art Park scheme (almost finished!); working with 
    CROWS and the Community Service “Punishment in the Community” teams in 
    making the footpath from the end of Church Lane over the Downings to Bow 
    Wow; providing two more children’s football pitches to assist the Cerney 
    club to get their highly successful junior soccer teams up and running. And 
    that is after the normal routine work involved in keeping this old village 
    ticking over.</p>
    <p>We also won the Bledisloe Cup for the second time in four years. That’s 
    not bad considering that it is not permitted to enter the year following a 
    previous win. The judges were extremely glowing in their comments on how our 
    village was looking last year and a lot of that had to be due to the 
    excellent work done by our grass-cutting contractor Adrian Gibbs and to our 
    own Eddie Curtis who is the main stay in our fight against litter around the 
    place. As always our sincere thanks to everyone who regularly picks litter 
    and helps to improve the standard of our village.</p>
    <p>A community such as ours is not entirely run by a Parish Council but many 
    other groups do their own thing and by doing so enhance everyone’s lives to 
    varying degrees. For example, we have the sterling efforts of the Play Group 
    in their rebuilding project. They have to raise a great deal of money to do 
    this and your Parish Council has included a sum of £5,000 in this year’s 
    precept as a contribution to their efforts.</p>
    <p>Another truly amazing effort was made in raising enough money to replace 
    the entire fishing fleet destroyed by that disaster in the village of 
    Kosgoda in Sri Lanka. Sue and Derek Poulton deserve a joint medal as big as 
    a bucket for organising the event held at the Cotswold Hoburne where over 
    six hundred people enjoyed one of the most successful fun evenings most of 
    us can remember. In doing so they raised almost £15,000. That money went 
    directly to the fishermen with no delay and with no other agencies involved.</p>
    <p>Another person who must be thanked for his sterling work is our Vice 
    Chairman Tony Squire. If you want a Mr Fixit, he’s your man. This last year 
    Tony has done so much for Cerney but his outstanding effort must be the way 
    in which he dealt with the terribly upsetting desecration of our War 
    Memorial. Some idiots pulled it down on New Year’s Eve and unfortunately it 
    failed to miss hitting them on the way down. Tony went to work and not only 
    arranged for the repairs and rebuilding of the Cross but he also had the 
    rest of the memorial cleaned. To cap it all raised all the money required 
    plus a bit more. Naturally Parish Council knew what was going on but Tony 
    did the job. Fantastic effort Tony, and thank you. I would like to remind 
    you all that a dedication ceremony will take place at the Memorial at 12 
    noon on 12th June. I hope to see you and more there.</p>
    <p>Every time there is an unsolved crime or problem in any community fingers 
    are always pointed at the youth. Unfortunately, most anti social behaviour 
    is caused by young yobs but thankfully, not all young people are yobs. In 
    fact, in this village we have I suggest only a very small number of problem 
    youngsters. Most of our younger people do not cause us any trouble. That is 
    despite the lack of facilities for them. There is a Youth Club run by Jan 
    Lodge and a band of helpers all of whom work under very restricted budget 
    and in a village hall that is not ideal for their purpose and needs, but 
    there is always a good group of kids at the meetings. It is a very limited 
    facility but an extremely valuable one for which this community is really 
    grateful. Thank you Jan for all your top class work. In appreciation of all 
    that you have done on behalf of the Parish Council I would like you to 
    accept this bouquet of flowers.</p>
    <p>A relatively new scheme for the children is the youth football being run 
    by the South Cerney club. On Saturday mornings the Upper Up car park is 
    overflowing with cars and last weekend I counted well over 60 adults plus 
    other teenagers watching two matches and some four or five groups being 
    trained. The club deserves a big vote of gratitude for their efforts.</p>
    <p>Then we have the mad young devils for whom we constructed the Mountain 
    Bike track. If ever there was a success that is one. They have a marvellous 
    time spending probably more effort constructing ramps than they spend 
    jumping over them. They cause us no problems whatsoever except when the want 
    another twenty tons of soil to build even more jumps. If there is an example 
    of what young people can do with just a little help from their elders, this 
    is a very good one.</p>
    <p>When we do get vandalism, and we have definite proof of the perpetrators 
    we take action. This Council has worked with the Police in a few cases but 
    have also then taken civil action to recoup the costs of repairs. We had 
    damage to a piece of Playground equipment last summer and with excellent 
    help from WPC Nicola Nolan, successfully extracted all the money from the 
    four men responsible. We took another person to Small Claims Court and he is 
    paying of the repair bill plus court fees over a period of months. I hope 
    that news of our way of doing this has got around to others and is having a 
    civilising effect.</p>
    <p>So what do we have for this coming year? In setting the annual precept 
    your Parish Council have included not only the sum of £5 000 for the 
    playgroup rebuilding but also we have had to set aside another £3,000 to 
    replace the failing safety tiles below the various items of play equipment 
    in all the 3 playgrounds. We were also obliged to set aside another £2,500 
    to comply with the new allowances for Parish Councillors as instructed by 
    central government. We were able to restrict the increase in precept to 
    £10,000 above last year’s figure. The total precept for this year is 
    £61,295, which represents an increase of 62p per month on a Band D dwelling. 
    It is worthwhile noting that your Parish Council constantly seeks funding 
    from outside sources for all projects we undertake. I know that this village 
    gets top class service from your Council and very good value for the 
    relatively small amount you pay in way of the Parish Precept in relation to 
    the massive sums that go to the larger councils.</p>
    <p>This coming year will bring the new Village Plan. We are currently 
    working on the details and have been for several months. On 23rd June there 
    will be an open evening when everyone can comment on what has been 
    suggested. Please do make the effort to come to that, as your views are 
    needed. The final Plan should be prepared by the end of the year and will 
    give us several worthwhile projects to work at and to even further improve 
    the environment we are fortunate to live in.</p>
    <p>This is a great team of Parish Councillors to work with and my sincere 
    thanks to you all for the support you have given. However, I know that all 
    of us agree that without our clerk, Maurice McKee we would not have such an 
    easy job. Maurice, many, many thanks for the top class service you put in, 
    for the great craic we have, and for everything you have helped to achieve 
    for this village.</p>
    <p>Finally, I want to again thank all the Parish Councillors and District 
    Councillors for their dedication to our community. It is not an easy job to 
    do and apart from some pretty small allowances we do not get paid. Why do we 
    do it? Maybe because we enjoy it or maybe it’s because we are so very fond 
    of this special old village.<br>

    <b>REPORT BY POLICE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT HENRY AND POLICE SERGEANT 
    THEOPHILUS</b><br>
    <br>
    Chief Superintendent Henry explained how his role as a Divisional Commander 
    in the Gloucestershire Constabulary dovetailed with that of the District 
    Councils’ jurisdiction in the county. The Cotswold &amp; Stroud Police Division 
    stretched from Chipping Campden in the north to Kingswood in the south and 
    from the outskirts of Gloucester city in the east to the Wiltshire border in 
    the west. The Division was responsible for the policing of nearly two-thirds 
    of Gloucestershire geographically. The Cotswold and Stroud Division was 
    further sub-divided into the Stroud and Cirencester sub-divisions. Stroud 
    was controlled by three sub-divisions namely Stonehouse, Dursley and Stroud 
    town. Mr Henry emphasised that his priority was crime reduction and he would 
    much rather achieve that than inform a victim that his or her crime had been 
    solved. The most difficult type of crime to solve was that carried out by 
    travelling criminals as they were hard to identify but overall the only 
    category of crime increasing was that of violence which was mainly due to 
    the change in the method of counting. The biggest change in the organisation 
    this year was the introduction of the Community Safety Team based in 
    Cirencester, policing of which was in the very capable hands of PC George 
    Lager who at the moment was recovering from a heart attack. The meeting 
    wished him a speedy recovery.</p>
    <p>Sgt Theophilus illustrated his report with the following table which gives a 
    breakdown of the type and number of crimes in comparison to a previous year.</p>

    <p>At a time when crime trends nationally and elsewhere in the county are 
    rising we are particularly pleased with the overall figures for the parish 
    of South Cerney and Cerney Wick.</p>
    <p>Overall crime has been reduced by 21 crimes which amounts to a reduction 
    of 15 per cent and of the crimes recorded for the period 2004–2005 24 per 
    cent were detected. It was not feasible to have zero crime so therefore when 
    numbers are small it is very difficult to reduce the percentage difference. 
    In South Cerney last year there was one drugs offence whereas the previous 
    year there were two but this gives a percentage change of 50%.</p>

        as a cyclist he used on a daily basis to go to and from his office. Cllr 
        Stuart informed the meeting of imminent plans to reduce the speed limits 
        on the Cirencester road from 60 mph to 50 mph and where it was 50 mph to 
        40 mph.<p>Mr Henry would ask Sgt Rawlins of the Road Policing Unit and

        <p>Cllr Squire informed the meeting that with the benefit of a grant 
        from Cotswold District Council and a further one from Gloucestershire 
        County Council Highways the Parish Council hoped that three interactive 
        speed signs would soon be erected. Cllr Stuart said that the speed limit

        with over 200,000 was the highest recorded county compared to 
        Gloucestershire’s approximately 4,000 which was the lowest.<p>Mr Henry 
        explained until recently Gloucestershire did not have a traffic camera 
        alliance but now that mobile speed teams were in action for up to 16 
        hours a day, convictions should become more average.</p>
        <p>Cllr Smith commented that four years ago he had attended an Annual

    <b>REPORT FROM CAPTAIN ALEX MITCHELL, 29 REGT RCT</b><br>
    <br>
    Personnel from the regiment at South Cerney, Duke of Gloucester Barracks are 
    currently serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans; in addition small 
    detachments have been/are deployed worldwide in support of exercises and 
    ongoing commitments. Over the last 12 months the regiment has continued to 
    provide movement support of troops and equipment worldwide; including postal 
    and courier support. The regiment’s prowess in the sporting arena has grown 
    from strength to strength; particularly with the ladies ski team who became 
    the RLC champions in February, and the Silver Stars Display team who have a 
    number of members representing the UK in the forthcoming World 
    Championships. Worthy of note is the tremendous support that the Silver 
    Stars have given to charitable organisations (country wide), it is believed 
    that they helped to raise in excess of £150,000 over the last 12 months. The 
    Duke of Gloucester Barracks Open Day has been scheduled for Sunday 24th 
    July; everyone is welcome to attend.</p>
    <p>Cllr Stuart thanked the 29 Rgt RLC for their generous donation of £500 to 
    help with the repair of the War Memorial which had been presented yesterday 
    17th May. He then asked Cpl Steven Walker, 29 Regt RLC to officially present 
    the signed, numbered print to the Village Hall. The print depicted the 
    Squadron at work in different theatres and Cllr Stuart thanked Cpl Walker 
    for this personal gift.<br>

    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CLLR M. BAINES (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Baines explained that he was one of three elected members of the 
    Cotswold District Council which represented the Water Park Ward of which 
    South Cerney and Cerney Wick were part. He reported that the political 
    structure of the District Council had politically changed from a Committee 
    to a Cabinet structure under Conservative control. He observed that because 
    of the changes his work load as a District Councillor had drastically 
    reduced and he had not enough to do.<br>

    <b>Licensing</b><br>
    I remain as chairman of the council’s Licensing Committee. The new Act is 
    generally regarded as a bad piece of legislation which will only help line 
    the pockets of the legal profession. The draft guidance notes are about two 
    to three inches thick. Two extra staff have been taken on to cope with the 
    volume of work expected. The department is drawing up a ‘simple guide’ to 
    the new legislation which will be available to Parish Councils on request. 
    It’s not ready yet. The three pubs in the village will all have to apply for 
    premises’ licences and the ‘landlords’ will have to get personal licences. 
    If they want to remain as they are at the moment with no changes to the 
    opening hours the application is basically rubber stamped. If they want to 
    vary the hours, say until l am on Friday and Saturday, or they want to have 
    live music on a few nights each week and there are no objections, that will 
    also go through. It’s only when there are objections that the committee will 
    become involved. A warning: The committee will have just four considerations 
    when looking at an application: Prevention of crime and disorder; public 
    safety; prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from 
    harm. Main interest for most people is how it will affect village halls. A 
    straight conversion from old licence to new costs nothing (free). If hall 
    has a bar and would sell alcohol (Chedworth is an example) then the 
    conversion to new licence costs £100. There will be an annual fee of £70 for 
    the licence in either case. These fees have been set by central government. 
    Green wheelie bins were a great success as were the free long life light 
    bulb. I think between us we gave away almost 600 packs in the ward.<br>

    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR A. CLARK (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    One of the Committees I serve on is the Joint Water Park Committee which is 
    made up of the two County Councils and two District Councils dealing with 
    the strategy of the Water Park. This sometimes gives me the opportunity to 
    feed in the concerns of the Parish Councils, i.e. the state of the Spine 
    road and cycle way etc. It also gives the four Authorities the opportunity 
    to consult each other and agree on matters regarding the Water Park and I 
    think the Committee now works well. However the Planning Committee which I 
    and Cllr Bennett (CDC) serve on has a huge number of applications in this 
    Ward and particularly this Parish. All applications go out for consultation 
    to the Parish Council, and the Planning Committee here works very hard on 
    these applications, and we always try to put the point of view of the Parish 
    at the meetings. Ninety five percent of applications are delegated now, 
    which is the target set by Government, and as a result we received a 
    delivery grant of £294,000. It is worth mentioning that objectors or 
    supporters together with a Parish Councillor and Applicant can come and 
    speak at the meetings, this has proved very valuable to the Committee. I sit 
    in at as many of the Parish Council meetings as possible, and we try to 
    follow up on any matters that the Council ask us to.</p>

    <p>The Chairman welcomed Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) as the recently re-elected 
    member of Gloucestershire County Council representing the area.</p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR S. PARSONS (GCC)</b></p>
    <p>Cllr Parsons (GCC) explained that elected Conservatives now had an 
    overall majority of three and were in control of Gloucestershire County 
    Council. Cllr Parsons had been appointed to the GCC Cabinet. He stated that 
    responsibility for road safety rests with GCC Highways but responsibility 
    for cleaning and maintenance was confused. For example street furniture was 
    the responsibility of the GCC but sweeping the carriageway was that of the 
    CDC. Other complications were the number of authorities involved as the road 
    traversed two counties involving two District Council and two County 
    Councils. He encouraged the Parish Council to continue to apply pressure 
    wherever possible to make the road safer. Under planning permissions 
    operators’ lorries must have their wheels washed before joining the 
    carriageway although infilled sites do not generally have this obligation as 
    permission should have been granted before the problem manifested itself. 
    What is now needed is a proactive instead of a reactive response. He was 
    trying to organise an overlord to whom the Parish Clerk could report 
    instances regarding mud, dirt or dust on the highway. He believed that it 
    was important to deal closely with Parish and Town Councils which had 
    problems on local roads. He had liaised with GCC Highways and the Parish 
    Council over the planned reduction in the speed limits along the Cirencester 
    to Preston Toll Bar road. Money was now in place for the installation of the 
    interactive speed limits. The pedestrian crossing was currently delayed 
    because written objections to the first site had been received. A plan of 
    where the new site might be placed was in the post. Further consultations 
    could take up to six months but he was sure that by the end of this 
    financial year the crossing would be in place. The cyclepath from South 
    Cerney to Cirencester was under discussion but making it possible would take 
    time but one had to start somewhere and the route along the canal showed 
    most promise. The largest single element of the Council Tax was Education 
    which accounted for 66% of the budget. Other demands included Social 
    Services, Environment, the Fire Service, Roads and Trading Standards. There 
    had been an increase in Council Tax of 47% over the last four years. As 
    Chairman of the Water Park Joint Committee he reported that the Regional 
    Development Agency had a conceptual plan amounting to £100,000 plus which 
    was now £15,000 short of target. It would be used to define a plan of how 
    the Water Park faces the future. Settlements in the area had suffered 
    through its development and now needed to be consulted. There was no master 
    plan at the moment.</p>

    <b>REPORT FROM THE HEADTEACHER STEPHEN RICHARDSON AND READ ON HIS BEHALF BY 
    BRIAN CLIFFORD CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNORS OF ANN EDWARDS SCHOOL</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Personnel</b><br>
    We have seen very few changes in staff this year. Diana Goodinson rejoined 
    our team, Mrs Julia Nicholas joined our team in the office and Mrs Karen 
    Griffiths and Mrs Jo Causer were taken on as a teaching assistant and a 
    part-time teacher respectively. We have met the challenge of providing all 
    teaching staff with their statutory entitlement to PPA (Planning, 
    Preparation and Assessment) time from September 2005. Before I started at 
    the school in September I was involved in interviews to replace two 
    established members of staff. The governing body has also seen changes with 
    the reconstitution process now complete; we have welcomed two new governors 
    Mr Paul Borrow and Mr Chris James. Other governors have been allocated a new 
    title. On our annual PLASC (Pupil Level Annual Survey Census) we had 301 
    children on roll and it looks as if there will be about 34 children joining 
    us in September.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Curriculum and SATS</b><br>
    All the children in KS2 and Y2 have just finished their optional or 
    statutory SATs and our SATs results for 2004 were very pleasing, with 
    excellent progress being made by children within the school and pupils 
    achieving well at the end of KS2. The school continues to offer a good 
    quality of education for its pupils and they receive a broad and balanced 
    curriculum. We remain a category 1 school within the LEA.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other extra curricular school activities</b><br>
    The school continues to offer a full range of after school clubs including 
    for example, football, netball, tag rugby. cricket, rounders, cookery, 
    gardening, Spanish, computer, chess, racquet skills, bug club, scrabble 
    club. modelling/warhammer club and judo. These are well attended by the 
    pupils. We have held adult learning courses at the school working with the 
    Family Learning centre and Parentline Plus. Our Y4, Y5 and Y6 children have 
    either taken part in or will soon be taking part in residential visits to 
    The Wilderness Centre, Braeside and SCOEC. We have recently contributed 
    artwork to the Gateway Centre, Deer Park School and the Village Flower Show.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Footsteps – Educating towards a more sustainable future</b><br>
    We have continued our link with the Joel Omino School in Kisumo and we have 
    received their Golden Tapestry for display at the Commonwealth Games. Our 
    tapestry is nearly completed.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other projects</b><br>
    We have had visits from the Lifestyle Education Bus, various theatre groups. 
    Nick Williams the Birdwise man and the children have visited SCOEC for two

    <b>REPORT BY MRS A. STUART, SECRETARY VILLAGE HALL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</b><br>
    <br>
    We are coming to the end of our mammoth renovation/redecoration of the 
    village hall. I hope you agree it is looking good. The curtains should be 
    replaced shortly and a blind placed on the door, and then all will be 
    complete and we can sit back and do nothing – I don't think! As with all 
    community buildings, especially ones such as our village hall, there is 
    always something that will need to be done, repaired or replaced, but the 
    major expenditure is now, for the moment, complete.</p>
    <p>During the past 12 months we have had the Gloucestershire Community 
    Service workers decorating the hall. These are people who are doing 
    punishment in the community. The majority of these people have no 
    painting/decorating skills and I am sure you will agree that, under the 
    guiding eye of excellent supervisors, they have done a very creditable job. 
    There is still a certain amount of snagging to be done but we have been 
    assured that they will continue to work on the hall until we are completely 
    satisfied with the result. We have been delighted to find that almost all of 
    the community workers have taken pride in what they are doing and I think it 
    shows.</p>
    <p>As I am sure you are aware this service is free (with the exception of a 
    small administration charge) so saved the community a great deal of money – 
    we only had to purchase the paint. There was some inconvenience in the fact 
    that this work was carried out over an extended period, but worth it in the 
    end.</p>
    <p>At this point, and I have to admit to a personal interest, I would like 
    to mention the village hall caretaker, my daughter Fiona, ably assisted by 
    her husband Nigel, for all their hard work in keeping the hall clean and 
    tidy and producing accurate bills for the Treasurer. I think you will all 
    agree the hall not only looks good, but smells good to, thanks to them. I 
    must also thank Peter Jay, the Treasurer, and especially Mike Stuart, the 
    Chairman, who have put in many hours free of charge, with Mike, following a 
    request from the Community Service Supervisors, opening up the hall and 
    liaising with the supervisors as to what they will do on that day, then 
    calling in to see them pack up and leave in the afternoon; this task carried 
    out every Wednesday and Sunday since work started in the autumn last year 
    and taking up a minimum of 3 hours a week.</p>
    <p>At this point I, on behalf of the Village Hall Trustees, would like to 
    thank the Clubs, groups and firms using the hall, with one notable 
    exception, for their forbearance with the disruption caused and some dust 
    that was missed (it seeps into the stacked chairs and is easily missed by 
    anyone cleaning the hall). The majority have been very supportive and we 
    really appreciate it.</p>
    <p>Also during the past 12 months we have totally transformed the committee 
    room, creating a room suitable for meetings and conferences. We have lined 
    the walls with pin-board, including white board, and purchased tables and 
    chairs set out permanently for meetings. When not required for meetings 
    these tables do stack well and are also lighter and more easy to move around 
    than the previous tables.</p>
    <p>We are very grateful to David and Sarah Smith who have continued to run 
    the Cerney Cinema every month. At no cost to us Sarah drives around the 
    Cotswolds on the Saturday to pick up the equipment, then stores it at home 
    for the next village to pick it up on the Sunday morning. Attendances have 
    been mixed, with less people attending during the winter months, due in 
    part, no doubt to the weather, but also the choice of film, which is, in the 
    main, outside of our control. However, with the summer now upon us, and an 
    excellent choice of film, attendance at the last two have been excellent. 
    Late last year the committee decided to apply for an occasional drinks 
    licence for the cinema. Mike duly attended court and is now the licensee. 
    This has proved popular and greatly added to our monthly income at the 
    cinema. We also run a monthly raffle, organised by Hilary Thornton, ably 
    assisted by Tommy Walker – they both do an excellent job. At the start of 
    this venture the committee felt they would like the money raised to go 
    towards a specific item in the village hall. Consequently the cost of 
    purchasing the majority of the padded chairs (roughly £1,750) has been 
    raised from the Cerney Cinema. So once again, thank you to David and Sarah 
    Smith, Hilary and Tommy.</p>
    <p>On 22 May last year we held an Open Day in the village hall when the 
    Brownies placed a time capsule in the loft to celebrate 50 years (51 years 
    actually) of there being a Brownie pack in the village.</p>
    <p>We, in conjunction with the South Cerney Players and Flower Show 
    Committee, have purchased a full set of demountable staging. Other minor 
    works have been carried out – all in all a busy year.</p>
    <p>Despite all the disruption the lettings for the hall, and therefore 
    revenue raised, have risen again for the fifth year running, totally in 
    excess of 70% in the past 5 years. However, were it not for the Parish 
    Council, who vote a grant of well over £3,000 to the Village Hall Committee 
    every year, we would still run at a loss as our Insurance Premium per annum 
    is a massive £2,700 and rising.</p>
    <p>The Trustees of the Village Hall are a very proactive committee. 
    Attendance at committee meetings is excellent and everyone works for the 
    good of the hall. However, I think special thanks should be given at this 
    point to Peter Jay and Mike Stuart who, as I have mentioned before, put in a 
    great deal of time, run around purchasing paint, banking money, and 
    generally overseeing everything that goes on, all at no cost to the hall. 
    Believe me if we paid the going rate for their services, the village hall 
    would cease to exist.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr M. Stuart closed the meeting at 9.30pm.<br>
