    <td width="100%" height="285"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 8th SEPTEMBER 2004</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7.05pm when Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart 
    welcomed Mr Tim Pain, Chief Executive Officer of the Cotswold Water Park 
    Society to the meeting. Mr Pain explained that his previous experience was 
    working abroad in a charitable background. Over the next 5 years he 
    anticipated that the leisure area of the water park would see a doubling in 
    size from 1,000 hectares to 2,000 hectares and a further doubling within 20 
    years. Gravel extraction would begin between the A419 and RAF Fairford but 
    would happen much more quickly than in the past due to new technology and 
    modern methods of aggregate extraction being employed. The Society intends 
    to build better partnerships with local councils and this could be a bonus 
    when sourcing funds as each could be the match funder for the other. Keynes 
    Country Park would double in the next 5 years and future plans include the 
    development of the Cleveland complex and Claydon Pike. Major work was 
    planned for the Bridge car park this winter. It was, he explained, one of 
    the few viewing points in the Park. The problem of what he described as 
    industrial feeding of wildlife at the Lakeside car park could be difficult 
    to resolve. This was leading to a dangerously high rise in the pH level of 
    the lake which was a SSSI and could possibly result in the Society 
    prosecuting itself for non compliance of its management. It should be 
    possible to negotiate a bridlepath to the north of Lake 16 with Aggregate 
    Industries. In the near future development would include the provision of 
    two new hotels and approximately 800 more second homes. Mr Pain reiterated 
    his determination to make the Water Park successful. Cllr Jay pointed to the 
    lack of access to footpaths in the park, that there was no safe cycle route 
    for local people to Cirencester and no dedicated police force to enforce law 
    and order during the influx of the expected tourists. Mr Pain explained that 
    the route from South Cerney to Cirencester was outwith his jurisdiction 
    although he was aware of the intention to create a cycle route from Swindon 
    to Cirencester. Due to time constraints the Chairman thanked Mr Pain for 
    attending and closed the meeting at 7.35pm.</p>

    Three members of the public were in attendance.<br>
    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.40 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Apologies for their absence had been received from Cllr Smith due to a 
    holiday, Cllr Baines (CDC) who was attending another meeting in Cheltenham, 
    Cllr Bennett and Cllr Parsons (GCC) who was also attending another meeting.<br>

    disassociated from the letter to Cllr Parsons (GCC) written by the Joint 
    Chairman of CROWS<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Webb that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. With the exception of 
    Cllr Caunce, Cllr Jay and Cllr Harris who abstained as they did not attend 
    the original meeting, the Parish Council was all in favour. Chairman Cllr 
    Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Advertising Signs</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas complained that the signs advertising the Nostalgia day at the 
    camp had not been removed at the end of Silver Street or on the roundabout 
    of the A419 and Spine Road.<br>
    Traffic Speed<br>
    Cllr Squire accompanied by Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr Webb had monitored 
    traffic speed with an interactive sign which notified drivers if they were 
    travelling over the speed limit. Speeding vehicles had been monitored at 
    58mph in Silver Street and 62mph in Broadway Lane. Cllr Squire said that the 
    Parish Council should consider purchasing interactive signs. The Parish 
    Council was in favour. The Clerk had sourced a supplier and price list but 
    Cllr Squire was positive that a cheaper version was available and would make 
    enquiries helped by Cllr Mrs Pollard. Cllr Squire had liaised with 
    Gloucestershire Constabulary which will erect a temporary interactive sign 
    and issue tickets to law breakers if they continue to speed after being 
    notified. Cllr Stuart referred to a letter from 29 Regiment Royal Logistic 
    Corps and a petition of 26 signatures from Mrs Roberts of the Pines on 
    Cirencester Road which was concerned with traffic speed on the Cirencester 
    Road especially where it by-passes Hambledon Crescent and Trenchard Gardens. 
    The Parish Council agreed to ask GCC Highways to consider reducing the speed 
    limit to 50mph for traffic from Preston Toll Bar to South Cerney along 
    Cirencester Road with the section which by-passes Hambledon Crescent and 
    Trenchard Gardens reduced to 30mph. Cllr Webb suggested that the speed limit 
    signs at the junction of Northmoor Lane and Silver Street be moved a further 
    150 metres north towards Cirencester. He observed that this was the only 
    gateway to the village which did not have red road markings to help to 
    reduce speeding vehicles. The Clerk was asked to arrange a meeting with GCC 
    Highways to discuss these issues.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>ZEBRA CROSSING</b><br>
    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart promoted this item as two members of the public 
    had attended to observe the debate.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas outlined the proposal of the installation of two crossings, 
    one in High Street and the other in Broadway Lane. The discussion had 
    started some 12 months ago when Ms Sue Andrews had attended a Parish Council 
    meeting which agreed to consider the possibility. After discussions it was 
    agreed that the Broadway Lane site had too many technical problems to 
    overcome and had been rejected. Although Ms Andrews, Mrs K. Isles and Mrs J. 
    Roberts have had discussions with GCC Highways they decided not to attend 
    this meeting as they had made their opinions clear at a previous meeting. 
    Cllr Nicholas continued that any design should minimise urbanisation. Cllr 
    Mrs Clark (CDC) said that any design would have to comply with current 
    legislation regardless of its impact. Cllr Jay was in favour of encouraging 
    children to walk to school and the design should be left to the experts. 
    Representations on the design could be made when the plans were in draft 
    form. Both Mr McEwen and Mr Beard, who were in attendance, had severe 
    reservations on the siting of the crossing which would be outside their 
    properties. Mr McEwen was concerned where he could park his cars or those of 
    visitors if a crossing was installed outside his home. He was also concerned 
    that the granting of planning permission to redevelop the Old Post Office 
    would create more traffic movements in the vicinity of the proposed 
    crossing. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) disagreed with Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr 
    Nicholas who had asserted that there was a majority of residents in favour 
    of a crossing. For example Mr McEwen and Mr Beard had not been asked for 
    their opinion. Mr McEwen was not in favour.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas proposed and Cllr Jay seconded a motion that this Parish 
    Council agrees that a zebra pedestrian crossing is installed in the most 
    suitable place in High Street subject to the provision of acceptable plans. 
    The Parish Council voted 8 in favour, 1 against and 1 abstention. The motion 
    was therefore carried.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    At 9.30pm on Sunday 15 August I had a visit from two young persons who paid 
    the Parish Council £36.25 each for damage they had caused to the basketball 
    apparatus at Upper Up playing field. The other two visited me on 31 August 
    with their contributions. On 16 August, in accordance with the instructions, 
    I sent the financial annual return for the year ending 31 March 2004 to 
    Andrew Vince who is the appointed auditor.<br>
    In August, of the 17 available working days, due to part of my annual 
    holiday entitlement I averaged 3 hrs 56 mins per day which is slightly more 
    than the 3 hrs 36 mins my contract allows.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village 
    Maintenance Committee which had met on Monday 6 September.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Ham Lane/Sudeley Drive Ramp</b><br>
    In reply to an enquiry made to ascertain whether the Parish Council would 
    have public liability cover if it proceeded to erect a ramp, Allianz 
    Cornhill Insurance confirmed that if proper procedures were observed the 
    Parish Council would be insured. The Clerk was to ask GCC Highways for a 
    list of appropriate architects to design such a ramp and to enquire if GCC 
    Highways would be prepared to carry out the installation on behalf of the 
    Parish Council.<br>
    <b>Footpath Work at Church Lane/Bow Wow</b><br>
    Cllr Squire informed the Committee that the path had been completed today. 
    The Clerk was asked to contact Phil Cluley regarding a closing device which 
    was needed on the gate at the Bow Wow end of the path.<br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart will call a meeting of the sub committee to meet up with Ms 
    Melanie Tarrant, GRCC Advisor at his house at 3pm on Wednesday 22 September.<br>
    <b>Basketball Apparatus, Upper Up</b><br>
    Payments totalling £145 and a signed letter of apology had been received 
    from four young persons who had damaged the equipment.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Tower Slide</b><br>
    No decision or recommendation was made on how to upgrade the climbing frame.<br>
    <b>Cycle Mounds</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that Adrian Gibbs had satisfactorily cut and strimmed 
    the weeds and herbage on the cycle mounds.<br>
    <b>Police</b><br>
    The Clerk was reminded to invite a senior officer from Gloucestershire 
    Constabulary to a meeting with Parish Councillors.<br>
    <b>Overhanging Tree</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to obtain quotations for tree work to tidy up 
    overhanging branches near 1 Broadway Court, Broadway Lane, South Cerney.<br>
    <b>Bledisloe Cup</b><br>
    The Clerk had enquired from Mrs Bull, Parish Clerk at Down Ampney, about the 
    removal of the Bledisloe mounted sign. Mrs Bull confirmed that the sign 
    could be removed by rocking it back and forth to loosen it before removal. 
    Cllr Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart volunteered to collect and install 
    the sign. The presentation is planned for Saturday 25 September at 2pm and 
    the Clerk was asked to invite Adrian Gibbs, Tim Stephens, Richard Wrightson, 
    Eddie Curtis and Jane his dog to the ceremony.<br>
    <b>Tree Seminar</b><br>
    Cllr Harris volunteered to join Cllr Webb at the seminar on Tree Wardens, 
    Parish Councils and Tree Legislation at Chedworth Village Hall on Saturday 
    11 September. The Clerk had informed the organisers.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the bucket seats on the Junior Swing would soon 
    need to be replaced as they were showing signs of wear. The goal posts had 
    been taken down but would be re-erected shortly. He further reported that 
    the recently completed drainage scheme was working well.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that a plank from the front of the wooden train engine 
    had been kicked out. The Clerk was asked to obtain a quote from R. O. W. 
    Berry for its replacement. Cllr Harris was concerned that the securing 
    screws had rusted and each should be replaced with a bolt arrangement. The 
    Committee agreed that repairs should be carried out when necessary. Cllr 
    Harris reported that the new gate had now been fitted.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the “No Dogs’’ sign was missing. The spring 
    closure on the gate was not working.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Car Parking</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform the residents of Strathmore, High Street to 
    stop parking on the public open space to the front of their property.<br>

    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0843/L</b><br>
    Applicant: KC Cars, Titcombe Garage, Clarks Hay, South Cerney<br>
    Retrospective application for a change of use of the garage forecourt to 
    allow for the sale of used cars at Central Garage, Clarks Hay, South Cerney 
    (R)<br>
    This change of use fundamentally affects the character of this focal part of 
    the village, and is out of keeping with the ‘local shops’ nature of the 
    other retail use in this area.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2443/P</b><br>
    Applicant: J. S. Bloor (Tewkesbury) Ltd, King John’s Galler, King John’s 
    Island, Mythe Road, Tewkesbury, Glos GL20 6ED<br>
    Amended Plans: Construction of twenty-four (24) dwellings and associated 
    works on land at 63-80 Berkeley Close, South Cerney<br>
    South Cerney Parish Council agreed to reiterate its previous objections. The 
    Parish Council is profoundly concerned that permission to build was being 
    sought on this site. Thames Water plc, the Environment Agency, Cotswold 
    District Council and Fosseway Housing should demonstrate that the original 
    problems of sewerage and surface water disposal had been addressed. The 
    public open space on the plan is not an effective replacement for the 
    existing play area next to the scout hut. The Parish Council agreed to 
    request a Condition, if permission was granted, that 40% of the dwellings 
    should be allocated as affordable housing. In reply to a series of questions 
    to the above 4 agencies, of particular concern was the admission by Thames 
    Water plc that conclusions from the study of the severe flooding in 
    2000–2001 are not yet available and any solutions which may be proposed will 
    need to be carefully considered. The CDC should not consider any planning 
    application in this area until the report is complete. As Thames Water plc 
    will not adopt the sewage infrastructure presently managed by Fosseway, the 
    housing association should be encouraged to upgrade its inadequate drainage 
    system with some of the proceeds from the sale of the land in Berkeley 
    Close. The Parish Council agreed to support Mr &amp; Mrs Chapman and the other 
    residents of Berkeley Close at every opportunity in their quest to find a 
    solution. There was further concern at the amount of new applications in the 
    Parish which, if granted, would add to the already overloaded system.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>

    <b>CT.3115/F</b><br>

    <br>
    <b>CT.4454/H</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr &amp; Mrs J. Cayford, Braydonside, Brinkworth, Chippenham SN15 5AR<br>
    Removal of Condition 2 on CT.4454/D to allow building to be used as a 
    residential dwelling at Quarry Barn, Cricklade Road, South Cerney<br>
    The Committee consider that there is no evidence of a change in 
    circumstances for this property since the condition was imposed. The Horse &amp; 
    Groom consent clearly falls into a specific Policy of the Local Plan and 
    therefore is not directly analogous.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.6460/G</b><br>
    Applicant: G. Sheppard &amp; O. Card, 5 Box Cottage, Elcombe, Wroughton, 
    Swindon, Wilts.<br>
    Outline application for the erection of two dwellings and vehicular access 
    on land to rear of 17-22 The Leaze, South Cerney<br>
    The drawing is not accurate insofar as it does not show the new dwelling to 
    the east of the site. The Parish Council has no objection subject to the 
    sewage connection being considered adequate.<br>
    A separate vote was taken to determine the Parish Council’s response to this 
    application. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
    that the Parish Council did not object to this application. The result was 6 
    in favour and 4 against. The motion was therefore carried.<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council accepts the deliberations of the Planning Committee on the foregoing 
    applications with the exception on CT.6460/G which had been determined 
    earlier. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    Deerhurst. Reason: An additional separate unit of accommodation would not be 
    permitted in this location because of its close relationship with the 
    adjacent dwelling and lack of private amenity space. This condition is 
    appropriate in the light of advice within PPG1 and Circular 11/95.<br>
    5. Notwithstanding the approved plans the roof slopes of the development 
    shall be covered with a good quality artificial Cotswold stone slate. 
    Reason: To ensure that, in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan 
    Policies 1 and 40, and PPG1, the development will be constructed of 
    materials that are appropriate to the locality and the existing buildings. 
    It is important to protect and maintain the character and appearance of the 
    area in which this development is located. The Conservation Team will be 
    happy to advise on the details of materials.<br>
    9. All garage doors shall be of vertical boarded timber. Reason: To ensure 
    that in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1 and 40, and 
    PPG1, the development will safeguard the character of this building. The 
    garage doors will be a readily visible feature of the development. 
    Traditional, vertical boarded garage doors will be more appropriate and in 
    keeping with the appearance of the area, than any other design.<br>
    <b>CT.4031/G</b><br>
    Replace flat roof over existing ancillary outbuilding with pitched roof 
    covered in reconstructed stone slates/tiles at Atkyns Lodge, Silver Street, 
    South Cerney<br>
    Conditions to note are: 2. The development shall not start until samples of 
    the proposed reconstructed stone slates have been approved in writing by the 
    Local Planning Authority and only the approved materials shall be used. 
    Reason: To ensure that, in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan 
    Policies 1, 27, 29 and 40 the development will be constructed of materials 
    of a type, colour, texture and quality that will be appropriate to the site 
    and its surroundings.<br>
    5. The reconstructed stone slates shall be laid to diminishing courses. 
    Reason: To protect the character and appearance of the conservation area and 
    the setting of the listed building in accordance with guidance in PPG15 and 
    Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 27, 29 and 40.<br>

    Present: Chairman Cllr M. Stuart, Cllr R. Webb, Cllr Mrs C. Pollard, Cllr P. 
    Jay and Mrs J. Gardiner<br>
    Members of the Personnel Committee recommend that in recognition of the

    at the highest appropriate level agreed by the National Joint Council for 
    Local Government Services and jointly recommended by the National 
    Association of Local Councils and Society of Local Council Clerks.<br>
    This is in accordance with Scale LC1 (Population under 5,000) on Spinal 
    Column Point 21 (£8.819p per hour) as from 1st April 2004.<br>
    It should also be noted that the above recommendation is part of a three 
    year agreement and that the corresponding recommended rate of pay as from 
    1st April 2005 will be £9.08p per hour (2.95% increase).<br>
    The April 2006 increase will either be 2.95% or the cost of living increase

    recommendation.<br>

    COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS<br>
    Cllr Squire asked that the Parish Council increase its newsworthy 
    contributions to Cerney News. It was agreed to publish the Bledisloe Cup 
    report, the debate about the zebra crossing and the Parish Council’s 
    commitment to support residents at both ends of the village in their quest 
    to solve drainage problems. Cllr Squire reported that in his opinion the 
    signs at the junction of Station Road and B4696 were dangerous and their 
    positioning should be reconsidered. He further reported that there was water 
    leakage in Sudeley Drive between properties numbered 16 and 18.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that the date for the planning enforcement 
    hearing regarding the wall at the Limes had been rearranged for October 19.<br>
    Cllr Jay asked that action be taken to mend the pot holes in Bow Wow, 
    especially between the wooden bridge through to Clarks Hay. He further 
    reported that the dead cherry tree in Clarks Hay next door to the Old Chapel 
    and Stoneycroft should be lowered to ground level.<br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that heavy lorries were using Cerney Wick Lane and 
    should be stopped because of the muck being left behind on the carriageway.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the gate to Lake 9 in Church Lane, Cerney 
    Wick had been open for use during the last Bank Holiday which she suspected 
    was a breach of a planning Condition. The Clerk was to ask Latton Parish 
    Council to arrange for the hedges to be cut in Cerney Wick Lane where it 
    joins the old A419.<br>
    Cllr Harris requested that Phil Cluley GCC Highways PROW officer improves 
    the signage of the cycle path from the old railway line to Kingfisher Place.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas complained about the excessive car parking charges by Cotswold 
    Water Park Society at Keynes Country Park. There should be a concession to 
    local residents and liaison should be encouraged with local groups.<br>
    Cllr Stuart had been requested by Mrs Newing 35 Sudeley Drive to consider 
    including the small strip of grass in the Sudeley Drive hammer head in next 
    year’s ground maintenance schedule.<br>
