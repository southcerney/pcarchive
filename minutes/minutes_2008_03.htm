    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 12th March 2008</strong>.</p>

At 7pm Cllr Stuart welcomed Kate Bishop, Public Protection Manager at CDC to a meeting
with Parish Councillors. Kate explained that amongst the many responsibilities her
department was involved with Environmental Health, Pest Control and Dog Control were
some. There were two environmental wardens employed by the District Council. Fly tipping
should be reported to Scott Williams, Waste Services Manager. As dog fouling was
particularly difficult to prosecute in a Magistrates Court new powers which have the ability
to issue fixed penalty notices are being considered but not yet adopted. A recent consultation
showed that only 18% of Councils in the District responded. Cllr Stuart stated that as this
Parish Council had no prior information or details, the questions in the consultation could
not be answered. Mrs Bishop stated that further consultations were being planned and
hopefully this meeting would enlighten councillors to the objectives. The timetable would be
as follows: March–May draft orders and consultation; June/July committee approval. If
approved the Orders would then be formally publicised and in September the new controls
would be implemented. Cllr Jay wanted to know what was to be done with stray dogs during
out of office hours. Mrs Bishop explained that from 6th April the District Council would
have sole responsibility for dealing with stray dogs and will be required to provide holding
kennels during out of hours. In reply to a question from Cllr Mrs Chubb who enquired about
dogs worrying sheep, Mrs Bishop stated that this would continue to be handled by
Gloucestershire Police. Cllr Stuart was more concerned with the one or two who do not clear
up after their animals. Mrs Bishop asked that all instances of this nature be reported and the
information would then be stored on the District Council’s data base. Hot spots could be
determined and action taken to stop the abuse. Interestingly Mrs Bishop informed the
meeting that Orders could be specifically tailored to areas within a complex which may be
appropriate for the football and cricket pitches at Upper Up. Mrs Bishop stated that it would
be useful if Parish Councillors would help in policing the Orders but members were not
convinced that it would work. Cllr Jay stated that Parish Councillors were representatives of
their community and it was not their duty to police it. Cllr Nicholas suggested that it would
be better if the PCSOs were recruited for this purpose. Cllr Stuart volunteered to accompany
Mrs Bishop or a deputy to walk the village to determine which parts would benefit from the
inclusion in any new Order. He added that any further consultation on the proposed Orders
would be welcomed. He then thanked Mrs Bishop for attending the meeting and she left the
room at 7.30pm<br>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had declared a prejudicial interest as the 
 appellant was his friend and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">39. CT.1498/C: Invitation to respond to planning appeal of 
 proposed new dwelling at The Ridges,<br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2373 – 5th paragraph, 2nd line delete “Forge” insert:

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge and Michael Brown attended on behalf of the YPC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge apologised for the absence of any representative 
 at previous meetings. The YPC supports the application of a grant from the Land 
 Fill fund. Dom Brown had stated that he wanted less involvement but would 
 continue to participate in a lesser role. Alasdair Kennedy had joined the group 
 recently. A new contact sheet was being prepared. The design of the MUGA was 
 agreed as an oblong shape with a wall dividing the area on the longer side and 
 a shelter approximately at the middle point. An AGM was being planned and if 
 necessary an election. Joe Lodge positively welcomed a request from Cllr Mrs 
 Land who had asked if it would be acceptable for her to recommend youths to 
 join the YPC. The preferred age group should range from 11–18 year olds. Joe 
 informed the meeting that it was possible to earn a partial GCSE qualification 
 if 50 hours of proven involvement with the YPC could be confirmed. Cllr Stuart 
 told Joe Lodge that the application for £5,000 from the Big Lottery fund had 
 been successful and the money would subsidise the installation of a shelter 
 alongside the MUGA. Cllr Stuart informed both YPC members that he, Cllr Caunce, 
 the Clerk and our agent Stuart Milsom had met with representatives of Thames 
 Water that morning and it was agreed that users of the cycle mounds would be 
 consulted when the rebuilding of the mounds took place shortly after Easter. 
 Thames Water will consider a suggestion that they dig out an area of MUGA size 
 and use the turf to cover the path created by their equipment when crossing the 
 playing field. If this was agreed it would be a step further in bringing the 
 plan to fruition. At the end of the discussion the Chairman thanked both 
 members of the YPC for their attendance although his offer to them that they 
 could remain for the rest of the meeting was rejected.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Safer Community Conference</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart thanked all those who had attended the Safer 
 Community Conference on 28th February. There was a very good turn out from both 
 the Parish Council and members of the community. He continued: “Ours was one of 
 the first in the CDC area and everyone is still on a learning curve with a lot 
 to come to terms with. A survey carried out by PCSO L. Pooley gave anti-social 
 behaviour and speeding as the main concerns and these were echoed at the 
 meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">One major problem that was raised at the meeting was the 
 anti-social behaviour situation in the Berkeley Close, Winchcombe Gardens and 
 Evergreen Business Park areas. I had assured Clair Cunningham, a resident from 
 Winchcombe Gardens, that the Parish Council takes her complaints very 
 seriously. PCSO Pooley went on holiday immediately after the meeting and we 
 cannot do much until she returns. However, that sort of situation is just what 
 the SARA plan is intended to deal with and is very similar to the example case 
 we worked on at the course we attended. I have discussed this with Les Haines 
 and when Ms Pooley returns from holiday we will see what can be achieved. The 
 problem will also be discussed at the Safer Cotswold Forum in early April.”</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wildmoorway Lane</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart wished to draw the attention of the Parish 
 Council to an email from Mike Barton GCC PROW to Alisa Watson at the 
 Environment Agency. “I hope this finds you well. I’m afraid I am writing in 
 total frustration regarding the progress, or lack of it, regarding the 
 clearance of Wildmoorway Lane. It is now 12 months since we met on site and you 
 informed me that you couldn’t sanction me taking any action because we needed 
 the approval of the Environment Agency who couldn’t authorise the path 
 improvements because there had been no flood plan from Watermark. At the start 
 of this financial year I applied for £3,000 of Aggregates Levy to put this path 
 right. As nothing has happened I have now lost that money and I am extremely 
 unlikely to get it back. Money is not easy to come by these days and I am not a 
 happy man. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As you know Wildmoorway Lane forms part of the Cotswold 
 Water Park which is becoming an ever popular tourist attraction. By sorting the 
 ditches and overhanging vegetation we can alleviate some of the water problems 
 currently plaguing the site. This would open up the path for everyone and join 
 up a great circular walk. What a superb bit of work that would be. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">My view is that this delay is wholly unacceptable. 
 Perchance, Phil Cluley met with Peter Hempsted of the Environment Agency last 
 week and actually took him to the site of the problem. Peter said that the path 
 was not on a main water course and he could see absolutely no reason why we 
 could not make any progress with our intentions. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As a result of this once the birds have stopped nesting 
 and in consultation with Simon Pickering and Gareth Harris, I intend to start 
 looking at the vegetation situation. Once that is sorted I will then start to 
 look at the drainage on the Spine Road side to alleviate the problems we are 
 having. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">My apologies if this appears a little curt but my 
 frustration and, I’m sure, that of many others is beginning to tell!”</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Loss of View from Millennium Seat, Bow Wow</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked Cllr Nicholas if any progress had been 
 with his negotiations. Cllr Nicholas was confident that there would eventually 
 be a favourable outcome.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cotswold Water Park Master Plan Consultation</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Nicholas for the hospitality 
 provided to all who had attended a meeting to formulate a response on behalf of 
 the Parish Council to the consultation. Cllr Nicholas confirmed that he had 
 completed the consultation via the web site. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resilience Grant</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk confirmed that the application for reimbursement 
 of expenses in relieving the potential flood hazard in the Robert Franklin Way 
 area had been submitted and would be determined by the CDC at the end of April. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay who had recently inspected the finished scheme 
 said it was a job well done.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 27th February I met with Cllr Stuart and Cllr 
 Caunce at Upper Up car park for a briefing by a salesman/surveyor from 
 Grasscrete Ltd. He described the various surfaces available and what would be 
 needed to accommodate heavier vehicles using the car park. For access to the 
 recycling bins and for emergency vehicles to service the football pitch a more 
 substantial load bearing surface would be necessary. If the covering was chosen 
 the car park could be out of action for a period of 10 weeks. The Chairman of 
 the Village Maintenance and Playing Field Committee Cllr Caunce and Cllr Stuart 
 both agreed to a request from Gordon Stratford of the Football Club that the 
 opening of the padlocked gate off the car park be reversed to ease the access 
 of large vehicles. As the Football Club members agreed to carry out the labour 
 the Parish Councillors would fund purchase the necessary hinges. Cllr Caunce 
 inspected the worn hinges on the larger swings and determined that in the 
 interests of safety two chain holders be replaced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 28th February I attended a meeting of the 
 Chartered Parishes group in The Members Room, Shire Hall, Gloucester. Delegates 
 from 22 Parish Councils attended. Eddie Coventry, head of the Emergency 
 Management Section explained how priorities were decided. He encouraged Parish 
 Councils to prepare a plan on how to react to future emergencies, whatever they 
 may be. Coordinating information from Neighbourhood Watches on potentially 
 vulnerable residents and how to maintain contact with them. Chris Rogan, head 
 of Gloucestershire Highways explained how his department was engaged in 
 repairing the infrastructure damaged during the July floods and continuing its 
 programme of clearing ditches to alleviate road flooding. There was difficulty 
 in coordinating the activities of Gloucestershire Highways and the Road Agency 
 which was responsible for the major through routes in the county. The third 
 edition of the Gloucestershire Charter was being prepared and further efforts 
 would be made to coerce those District Councils, including Cotswold to sign up 
 to the charter. The meeting which started at 4.30pm closed at 6.45pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 29th February I removed the poster from the notice 
 board in Clarks Hay which described the allowances Parish Councillors accepted 
 for the year April 2007– March 2008. The information had been displayed 
 originally on 14th February. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 3rd March I attended a meeting of the Big 
 Lottery Fund (BLF) play portfolio working group which discussed the role of the 
 group, especially its monitoring and steering requirements. Rosemary Lynn (CDC) 
 chaired the meeting with Claire Dowan in attendance. Two other councils, GCC 
 Youth Service, Play Gloucestershire and GRCC were also represented. The next 
 meetings were scheduled for Tuesday 24th June, 23rd September and 16th December 
 at 2pm</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">This morning, Wednesday 12th March, I attended a meeting 
 with Cllr Stuart, Cllr Caunce, Stuart Milsom (MAI), and persons from Murphy 
 contractors and its agent. I will now read a report from Stuart Milsom: </p>

 <br>
 Noted for next meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Links on Senior Swings</b> <br>
 After Cllr Caunce and the Clerk had inspected the links R.O.W. Berry had been 
 instructed to replace the D-bolts securing the chain to the overhead post. Mr 
 Berry was also asked to tighten the chain on the south side of the swing. Cllr 
 Caunce did not consider that the condition of the links merited taking the 
 apparatus out of commission. <br>
 Noted for next meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce, Cllr Stuart and the Clerk had met with a representative from 
 Grasscrete Ltd who surveyed the work required if installation of his product 
 was to be agreed. The committee agreed that the quotation received was well 
 beyond the budget and this type of surface could not be considered. The 
 committee did agree that work to refurbish the car park was necessary and the 
 Clerk was to enquire from Fairford Town Council which contractor it had used 
 and at what cost. Cllr Stuart and the Clerk had met with Neil Hartell of N.B. 
 Hartell who had made a more competitive quotation which the committee 
 recommended the Finance committee to accept. A plan to install a series of 
 traffic calming bumps was rejected. <br>
 Noted for next meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dog Bins</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to order three dog bins from Glasdon for £115.99 each 
 including delivery totalling £347.97. The Clerk was asked to advise Roger 
 Sollis of their sites (1) Church Lane, Cerney Wick – north side of lane, close 
 to barns owned by Julian Caunce, Long House, Cerney Wick; (2) opposite 
 Kingfisher Place, South Cerney – at bridleway access that leads under the 
 railway arches at the beginning of Wildmoorway Lane; (3) at the entrance to 
 Gypsy Lane (footpath) off west side of Broadway Lane close to opposite the 
 entrance to Oak Way. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Flooding Photographs</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge requested that the two photographs taken near Berry Farm, 
 Silver Street of the January floods are returned. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Four Pillars S.106 Grant</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that an application for a £500 grant had been successful 
 and would subsidise the cost of planting the new hedge on the Upper Up playing 
 fields. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Winchcombe Gardens Play Area</b> <br>
 After considering the exchange of recent emails with Bloor Homes’ 
 representative Guy Wakefield the committee was not minded to accept 
 responsibility for the play area. Nevertheless it believes that this decision 
 should not absolve Bloor Homes of its commitment imposed by the relevant 
 planning condition as part of the permission for this development. Mr Napper 
 CDC stated that in his opinion a piece of easily maintainable play equipment 
 should be provided as part of the completion of the relevant public open space, 
 together with a seat and litter bin. The equipment should be targeted at 
 younger children (i.e. toddlers) to respond to the needs of the likely 
 occupants of the new dwellings in an easily overlooked and accessible location. 
 The Parish Council decided that no further action or communication with Mr 
 Wakefield should be contemplated at this time.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that two of the top fixing bolts on the Senior Swing were 
 worn and one of the supporting chains was loose. A meeting with Thames Water 
 representatives, Stuart Milsom (MAI) and Cllr Stuart on the final refurbishment 
 of the cycle mounds has been arranged for Wednesday 12th March.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that all was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the hedge at the entrance side of the play area still 
 needed to be cut back as it was overgrown. Otherwise the play area was in 
 order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TREE SURVEY/OWNERSHIP</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had emailed the committee suggesting that as 
 the Parish Council had assumed the role of maintaining grass areas it could be 
 deemed responsible for the safety of trees thereon. He recommended that the 
 ‘expert’ tree survey should include all trees owned by the Parish Council and 
 also on trees that grow on land maintained by the Parish Council. The original 
 quotation from Tree Maintenance was £290 for 40 trees and further additions pro 
 rata. The estimate now would be for 60 trees which was a 50% increase to £435. 
 The Clerk was asked to recommend this revised quotation to the Finance 
 committee for its approval. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Acceptance of N.B. Hartell quote to refurbish Upper Up car 
 park. <br>
 Notification of the purchase of three (3) dog bins for £347.97 plus VAT <br>
 Acceptance of increase in the number of trees to be surveyed from 40 to 60 at a 
 cost of £435 plus VAT</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a resident had taken it upon 
 himself to remove ivy from trees along the old railway line. Unfortunately it 
 was being left in situ and was impacting on the biodiversity of the area. The 
 Clerk was asked to inform the Cotswold Water Park Society of the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had discussions with Jim Sokol from the 
 Environment Agency regarding his negotiations with Messrs Franklin regarding 
 the digging of a new ditch which would relieve them from clearing an existing 
 obstructed drainage ditch. Cllr Harris did not agree with this plan although he 
 supported any measures which will help with improving the drainage. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge asked that a stile under the bridge at 
 grid reference SO 0511 9773 on Berry Farm needed to be repaired. The Clerk 
 would inform GCC PROW. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reported that vandals had sprayed 
 graffiti on shed walls. Cllr Caunce advised her to inform the police on 0845 
 090 1234. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb noted that some new signs erected at the 
 junction of Station Road and B4696 had been positioned obstructing the sight 
 lines of oncoming traffic. Cllr Caunce advised her to inform GCC Highways on 
 08000 514 514. Cllr Mrs Chubb confirmed that she had made the telephone call.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the spread sheet was consistent with 
 its monthly percentage check on Parish Council expenditure..</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations of the Playing Fields and Village
 Maintenance Committee</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed to the recommendation from the 
 Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee that it spends £347.97 plus 
 VAT on three dog bins. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed to the recommendation from the 
 Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee that it spends £435.00 plus 
 VAT to carry out a professional tree survey. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Parish Council accepts the recommendations of the Finance Committee. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. The committee was minded to accept the quote 
 from N.B. Hartell but recommended that it produces references from satisfied 
 customers and adjusts its payment terms to accommodate the timetable of the 
 Parish Council before a contract for refurbishment of the car park is agreed. 
 In the light of recent developments acceptance of this quotation should be 
 delayed. It was feasible that Thames Water would refurbish the car park to 
 comply with its responsibilities.</p>

 Applicant: Ms Alison Russell, The Willows, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney GL7

 Proposal: Replacement of a temporary mobile home with a new building 
 incorporating (a) a three bedroom keyworker with (b) office space for the 
 fishery and fish farm at The Willows, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney GL7 5UZ</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Despite the amendments a new dwelling in this isolated 
 location is unacceptable and would have a detrimental impact on the 
 environment. The nature of the design is patently not for a “key worker”. There 
 is no genuine need for a dwelling on the site. It would be very undesirable to 
 have an individual primary residential dwelling on this or other lakes in the 
 Water Park. Whilst undoubtedly a high quality contemporary design, it would be 
 very conspicuous in this rural location. <br>

 Nicholas reported that he had attended the SARA meeting in the Village Hall on 
 28th February. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger (CDC) reminded members of the Parish 
 Council of the forthcoming Ward election and mentioned the Tory candidate by 
 name but was disinclined to repeat the other candidate’s particulars. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to write to Mrs Pumfleet at 
 South Cerney Riding Stables in Cerney Wick to remove obstructions from the 
 ditch in the vicinity of Eden House. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb requested that Gloucestershire Highways erect 
 signs at both entrances of Berkeley Close to signify that the street was now a 
 cul-de-sac. Cllr Webb reported that a recent meeting of the Village Hall 
 Committee the renewal of the thatched roof was discussed with regard to its 
 refurbishment albeit with provisos. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay was critical of a recent notice announcing road 
 shows on the new waste collection arrangements which Mike Harris (CDC) had 
 organised throughout the District. South Cerney was noticeable by its absence. 
 The Clerk had enquired as to its exclusion and was informed that a road show 
 might be possible if a suitable site could be found. Mr Harris had stated that 
 a recent show in South Cerney had been rather disappointed in the attendance. 
 Nevertheless he would enquire if the area outside the Londis or opposite could 
 be used.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported a dead tree in the hedge to the west 
 of the cricket pitch on the line of the new planned planting. He quoted £120 to 
 remove it but Cllr Nicholas volunteered to have it cut down if he could recover 
 the fire wood. The Parish Council had no objection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had reported the graffiti incident to 
 the Gloucestershire Police and had received an incident number. </p>

 exiting Lake 10 on Cerney Wick Lane was compacting. The drains were becoming 
 clogged as a result. Cllr Caunce, Chairman of the Village Maintenance and 
 Playing Fields Committee recommended that Cllr Mrs Chapman inform 
 Gloucestershire Highways on 08000 514 514 of the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk announced the the new vicar Revd. David Bowers 
 would be introduced by Mr Tony Squire, to members of the Parish Council prior 
 to its meeting in June. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had accepted an invitation 
 from Hoburne to represent the Parish Council at a dinner dance. Cllr Jay had 
 attended as a representative of South Cerney Trust and Cllr Walker represented 
 the Royal British Legion. Cllr Stuart stated that the hospitality provided was 
 well under the £25 limit. Cllr Stuart informed the meeting that the new main 
 sewerage pipe to Shorncote was now in operation. Cllr Stuart called for a show 
 of hands from those who had contacted the police on 0845 090 1234 and if they 
 were content with the time taken the operator to respond. Six hands were raised 
 and all were satisfied that the service reacted quickly. </p>
