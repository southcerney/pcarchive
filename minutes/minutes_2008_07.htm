 11th JUNE 2008</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2410 – List of those attending: Cllr Clarke pointed 
 that his name was spelt with an “e”. The Clerk apologised for this typing 
 error. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Walker and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge presented a mock up of YPC publicity material 
 which will promote the Youth Parish Council and its members. A decision would 
 be taken shortly on the final design. Members of the YPC were working on a 
 project Here By Right which was an accredited award towards a low level GCSE. 
 Certificates will be awarded at a ceremony to be held at Cotswold District 
 Council offices at Trinity Road on July 11th. Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart, Cllr 
 Walker and the Clerk volunteered to support the members of the YPC by attending 
 the event which was also the official launch of Play Matters in the Cotswolds, 
 a CDC Play Strategy. Cllr Walker reported that Dame Kelly Holmes had declined 
 the invitation although the agents concerned suggested other names. Cllr Stuart 
 reported that ground work contractors would start on the MUGA this week, 
 slightly earlier than expected. Park Leisure would start their installation of 
 the kick wall on Monday 21st July. The project was expected to be in operation 
 by August. The Finance Committee had agreed to a recommendation from the 
 Responsible Finance Officer that the balance of the YPC account be increased to 
 £2,000 to make up for its contribution to the Community First grant. The Parish 
 Council was in favour. Joe Lodge then left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart referred to his complaint last month about the 
 lack of communication with the police on community matters. He had a meeting 
 this afternoon, 9th July, with PC Jon Palfrey and PCSO Daniel Sinclair and was 
 more optimistic with the promised cooperation of the constabulary after a 
 recent internal reorganisation of the Cirencester station. PCSO Sinclair will 
 be organising a SARA meeting in the Village Hall in the near future. Speeding 
 motorists and motorcyclists and anti social behaviour were top priorities which 
 needed action. Cllr Stuart encouraged all members to attend to show their 
 support for the initiative. PCSO Mike Owen was currently on sick leave. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas referred to a letter he would draft to 
 Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP on the subject of flooding raised at a seminar held 
 at CDC to discuss how communities might react to emergencies. It would be 
 premature to write until the Pitt report and another from the Environment 
 Agency which included a section on the Churn Catchment Strategy was published. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had drafted a letter to Bruton Knowles, 
 allotment agents, enquiring who to contact regarding the land at the end of 
 School Lane, between the two current allotment sites (directly opposite the 
 last but one house in School Lane) that is currently used as a hay meadow. The 
 Parish Council very much supports the provision of further allotments in the 
 village, and would like to know whether the land in question could be brought 
 back in to use as allotments. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired if the Finance Committee had 
 discussed the implementation of a method to check if contracts awarded had been 
 completed satisfactorily before payment. Cllr Jay explained that the validity 
 of all payments were checked. In the case of some contracts it could be 
 prohibitively expensive to ask for a professional judgement and the limited 
 expertise of Parish Councillors would have to suffice. The system had worked 
 well in the past and the recent incidents of the notice board and the ground 
 maintenance contract illustrated its efficiency. Where considered necessary the 
 Parish Council will not hesitate to engage a professional to approve payment.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I took part of my annual leave from 16th June until 30th. 
 During this time I did not log time spent relaying emails about planning 
 matters or other business. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During June of the 10 available working days I averaged 5 
 hours and 30 minutes per day which is approximately 2 hours more per day than 
 my contract. The major part of my time is spent recording and actioning minutes 
 which predominantly occupies the first two weeks of any month. Consequently, as 
 I was on holiday during the last two weeks there was no time left to offset the 
 busy period.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE 
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th JULY</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As Cllr Caunce the Chairman of this Committee did not 
 attend the meeting, Cllr Stuart accepted his invitation to make the report. 
 Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Walker 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.07pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had sent an apology for his absence as he was occupied with his 
 business commitments. Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had sent an apology for her absence as 
 she was on a school trip.</p>

 <br>

 Councillors’ Reports</b> The Committee agreed that the above changes are made. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Rights of Way Issues</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had met with Mike Barton to discuss outstanding issues. Work would 
 start at Wildmoorway Lane in September; it had been agreed that the Pay Back in 
 the Community team would provide the labour and GCC would pay for the materials 
 for the work on the steps in Bow Wow; work on the permissive path bridge (Shorncote 
 Link) would start in September although a new price of £1,500 had yet to be 
 confirmed; discussions between Mike Barton and Mr Ducker agent of the owner Mr 
 Dave Telling on the marking of a footpath alongside Titcombe Garage in Clarks 
 Hay were continuing; the overgrowing path on Lake 16 will be attended to in due 
 course. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bledisloe Cup</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the village had progressed to the second round of 
 judging which would take place between the 13th and 27th July. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path</b> A meeting with Mr Westell had been 
 arranged for Wednesday 27th August at 10am in Huxley Court. Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Jay in his capacity as Chairman of South Cerney Trust will attend. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment</b> <br>
 The refurbishment of the Upper Up car park had been carried out. The Committee 
 agreed with Cllr Stuart who stated that a long term solution to upgrade the 
 surface was necessary. Plans and specifications should be sought so that a 
 budget for the work could be presented at the next precept meeting in January. 
 The project is to be added to the Task List. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ground Maintenance at Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had met with Mr Dave Buckley, Glebe Contractors and pointed out 
 areas on the playing fields which had not been properly maintained. The Clerk 
 was asked to provide Cllr Stuart with all invoices from Glebe Contractors for 
 analysis of work charged. Cllr Stuart wished to express his gratitude to Cllr 
 Harris for work carried out, at no charge, with his brush cutter and topper at 
 Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MUGA Developments</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart confirmed that Hartell Construction would start work on the MUGA 
 base, weather permitting, on 14th July. Cllr Stuart had updated the Parish 
 Council stating that work would start on 11th. Park Leisure would build the 
 goal end wall and youth shelter starting on 21st July. John Kimberley has 
 involved a section of village youth to dig out the base of the shelter as part 
 of their Prince’s Trust project. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to Safety Surface at Upper Up</b> <br>
 As there had been no reply the Clerk was asked to contact George Taylor again 
 to arrange for the repair of the safety surface and the provision of 10 bags of 
 special sand to spread on the surface. Contact with Mr Taylor had been 
 successful and he had asked for photographs of the damage which Cllr Stuart 
 will forward. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Composting Scheme</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported that a gratifying number of residents had responded 
 positively to the questionnaire so far. Replies had been encouraged to be 
 returned by the end of July.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce and Cllr Mrs Chubb were still researching types and prices of bus 
 shelters. When satisfied Cllr Mrs Chubb agreed that a proposal would be made to 
 the Parish Council for consideration. Cllr Caunce expected that the cost of a 
 shelter could be in the region of £4,500 and a figure would be presented for 
 consideration to the Precept Committee when it met in January 2009.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had briefed Cllr Stuart who delivered a report on the playing field 
 on his behalf. The pyracanthas bush on the northern boundary had been pruned 
 although the resulting harvest had been left on the playing field and would 
 have to be removed. The over growing brambles at the entrance to the play area, 
 which were a scratch hazard, needed to be cut back from the entrance to the far 
 side of the ditch. As the Cerney Wick Village Hall Committee had not cooperated 
 in reducing the brambles the Clerk was to arrange for quotations to carry out 
 the work and also to remove the pyracanthas cuttings. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the safety surface was still awaiting repair. The 
 cycle mounds are getting well used since their alterations. The newly laid turf 
 on the access road has taken well and the grass is growing. The site for the 
 MUGA has been cleared. Over the past weekend the Football Club held a two day 
 six-a-side competition which was very successful. Cars used the far side of the 
 pitch for parking. There is some sign of wear but this should grow over in the 
 next few days. The grass cutting generally seems much better than last time. 
 The surface of the car park will need a more expensive surface very soon. Cllr 
 Stuart thanked Cllr Nicholas for tightening the nuts on the picnic tables and 
 Cllr Harris for replacing Mike Oakeshott’s plaque. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in order. There was an overhanging 
 branch on the north side near the river Churn. There were two ash trees on the 
 boundary with Lakeside which had shed brittle branches (now cleared) and one 
 hung up in the tree. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MAINTENANCE OF LAND IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris proposed that maintenance of publicly owned 
 land in the village required a more extensive program than that provided 
 through the current grass cutting contract. He suggested that a specification 
 detailing jobs, which were necessary, be drawn up for the five sites: Upper Up 
 playing fields, Pocket Park, The Piece, Robert Franklin Way and Cerney Wick 
 playing fields. The Committee agreed that a maintenance schedule should be 
 designed to manage the areas. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DOG WALKING AREAS ON UPPER UP PLAYING FIELDS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had a quotation from Chris Graham to provide 
 a 1:1500 map of the area for £40. The Committee decided not to take any action 
 until Kate Bishop had published CDC plans for the control of dogs in the 
 District. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TREE SURVEY REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had provided a specification for the tree work 
 highlighted in the recent Tree Survey Report by Tree Maintenance Ltd. The Clerk 
 will ask for quotations from competent operatives.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that otters were once again a feature 
 of wildlife in South Cerney. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart had closed the 
 meeting at 8:30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th JULY</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>St James’s Place Foundation</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Jay were in communication with Ms Julie Nicholls and 
 developments were expected. Cllr Jay was in the process of applying for a grant 
 of nearly £2,000 from the CDC to enhance specific youth activities in the 
 village but was concerned about the confidentiality of the substance of the 
 quotation. Cllr Clarke (CDC) would keep a watching brief on developments and 
 try to ensure that the exact purpose of the bid would remain secret. Cllr Jay 
 was also in contact with Mary Mychaleckyj, Gloucestershire Youth Worker with a 
 plan to set up a working group to promote other youth activities in the 
 village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Rent of School Facilities</b> <br>
 Cllr Walker informed Parish Councillors that the School would charge £20 per 
 session rent for space at the school for youth activity. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Safer Routes to School</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay had a productive meeting with Stephen Richardson, Head Teacher at Ann 
 Edwards School on how to encourage safer routes to school. Two schemes were to 
 be promoted: 1. WoW which stood for Walk on Wednesdays and 2. Park and Stride. 
 Awards would be made to the school class which scored highest in its commitment 
 although individual prizes would also be awarded to those pupils participating 
 most successfully. The Committee had recommended the Parish Council agrees that 
 Cllr Jay is permitted to offer an incentive to those who participate in the 
 scheme. A grant to cover the cost of an educational trip was suggested. It was 
 proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land that the Parish Council 
 supports this initiative and approves the action of Cllr Jay. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay noted that analysis of the spread sheet indicated a possible overspend 
 on the Clerk’s travel expenses. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Glebe Contractors</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart will analyse invoices from over the past year to ascertain if 
 charges are being properly applied as per the contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b> <br>
 The Clerk had contacted Betec who accepted that the covering material on the 
 noticeboard needed to be reaffixed and the area enclosed on the right required 
 a new surface.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr 
 Stuart and Cllr Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas opened the meeting at 
 9.10pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications received by CDC</b> </p>

 Applicants: Mr &amp; Mrs M. Gill, Ham Cottage, Ham Lane, South Cerney <br>
 Revised schemes for proposed house and formation of hammerhead at land 
 adjoining Ham Cottage, Ham Lane, South Cerney GL7 5UF <br>
 The Parish Council objects to this application in the strongest possible terms, 
 due to the very considerable loss of privacy that would be caused to the many 
 adjoining properties. Moreover, the access down Ham Lane is not suitable for 
 the heavy construction traffic that would be needed for the ground works 
 required in connection with such a development. The plan accompanying the 
 revised application is incorrect and misleading, since it refers to an 
 ‘Existing Access’ which in fact is not currently in use, nor has it been for a 
 considerable time. <br>
 OBJECTION <br>
 Mr O’Connor (CDC) had confirmed that previous objections in November and June 
 had been added to the file although the one for May did not appear. 
 Nevertheless the Planning Regulatory Committee would be made aware of the 
 objection from the Parish Council. There had been an email from a resident 
 after inspecting the documents stating there was only one reference to the 
 Parish Council objecting. <br>
 Cllr Nicholas thanked Cllr Messenger (CDC) and Cllr Bennett (CDC) who had been 
 very supportive about the concerns of neighbours. Cllr Messenger had attended 
 the site meeting and had insisted that the decision on the application should 
 not be taken through delegated powers. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Squire left the meeting. </p>

     Cllr Stuart stated many residents had voiced objections about the scheme. 
     Granted, he continued, this particular scheme had been discussed in general 
     terms with Gloucestershire Highways some two years previously but it had 
     been left in abeyance. It was his recollection, concurred by those on the 
     Council at that time, that the computer generated scheme produced at a site 
     meeting then, had been rejected and Gloucestershire Highways agreed to 
     re-design the plan. Since then there had been no further contact with the 
     agency on the plan. Discussion followed with no one speaking in favour of 
     having a build out. The consensus was that it would be preferable not to 
     have one. There was suggestion that Gloucestershire Highways had not 
     adhered to the Gloucestershire Charter by not properly consulting with 
     Parish Council. Mr Franklin of Gloucestershire Highways agreed to attend a 
     site meeting with Cllr Stuart and the Clerk on 10th July to discuss the 
     implications and concerns of this proposed build out and request that the 
     scheme was not carried out</td>
