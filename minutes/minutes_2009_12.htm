    <p align="left">Chairman Cllr Stuart welcomed Gareth Harris, Biodiversity Officer at Cotswold Water Park
Society Trust to the meeting. Gareth said that instead of giving a comprehensive description
of the many features of his work he had decided to concentrate on the Black Poplar and its
popularity in the Water Park. The species have an increasingly aged population and few have
been planted since the 1800s. In the UK there are less than 10,000 examples with only 223
to be found in the park. Currently there are 160 growing in nurseries and more are being
propagated for establishment. The trees needed to have their roots in water to have any
chance of survival. Nearly all UK trees are based on cuttings and not seeded. Only 500 of all
UK trees are female. Gareth asked the meeting if it could recommend any suitable planting
sites. Cllr Jay advised that Gareth should follow up his recent article in Cerney News by
letting residents know how to identify Black Poplars. Gareth stated that it was a highly
specialised skill to distinguish the species and personally he had to seek expert advice at
times. Bats and Great Crested Newts were also plentiful with in the park and he queried the
lack of a survey prior to the development which had taken place along the Spine Road and
its environs. Cllr Harris encouraged Gareth to publicise his biodiversity activities in the
Water Park through the Cerney News. Cllr Nicholas also suggested that he create a link with
the Parish Council’s web site. Cllr Nicholas enquired if Gareth could advise if there was
scope, for example, to improve the habitat of Wildmoorway Lane by laying the hedge? Cllr
Stuart stated that he, Cllr Jay and Mike Barton of Gloucestershire PROW had arranged to
meet with representatives of the Water Park Society regarding the state of the lane. Gareth
agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Caunce who asked if he could look at the proposed scheme
in Bow Wow which was currently out to tender. Gareth will arrange to meet up with Parish
Councillors after Christmas to tour parts of the village, the potential of which he may be
unaware. Cllr Stuart thanked Mr Harris for his fascinating talk and looked forward to the
village walk.</p>

 The Chairman , Cllr Stuart opened proceedings at 7.45pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>APOLOGY</b> <br>
 Cllr Bennett (CDC) had sent an apology as he was attending another meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 11th NOVEMBER 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr R.Webb and seconded by Cllr P. Jay 
 that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Members of the Parish Council 
 were all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PC SUE WATKINS, GLOUCESTERSHIRE CONSTABULARY</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following an invitation, PC Sue Watkins introduced herself 
 to members of the Parish Council. She described a new initiative Community 
 Orientated Policing (COPs) which gave police the power to deal with 
 misdemeanours without arrest but enabled them to require miscreants to make 
 retribution for damage caused. One requirement was that victims should approve 
 of the action proposed. Parish Councillors stated that it was an excellent 
 idea. Cllr Jay asked if the identify of informants could be protected? 
 PCWatkins said that it depended on the seriousness of the offence as sometimes 
 further action could not be taken unless a person was prepared to give 
 evidence. Questions were asked on the investigation of the recent graffiti 
 vandalism. Unfortunately PCWatkins explained that although some potential names 
 had been forwarded it was not possible to determine who had been responsible 
 and no further action was anticipated. The Chairman thanked PCWatkins for 
 attending and she then left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Jasmin Tresadern gave a report on the recent activities of 
 the Youth Parish Council. Jasmin explained that at a meeting held yesterday at 
 which only four members attended, three main topics were discussed: Play 
 Equipment; Future Members and Methods of Addressing the Public. Various items 
 of play equipment from Komplan, which was a specialist supplier of products 
 suitable for use by the disabled, were discussed. Items favoured were the birds 
 nest swing, the twin rider and the sea-saw. The total cost of the preferred 
 package was about £14,000 for which grants would be sought. Cllr Mrs Land said 
 that currently there was a CDC fund which would grant £10,000 or 35% of the 
 cost. Cllr Jay said that if a further third could be found then the Parish 
 Council could possibly be persuaded to fund the remainder. Cllr Mrs Land 
 emphasised that the Gloucestershire County Council’s priority theme for the 
 coming year was Youth in the Villages. Cllr Mrs Land answered positively, in 
 reply to a question from Cllr Stuart, that the package could be phased. Cllr 
 Jay stated that the project was very achieveable. Recruiting new members was 
 proving difficult and Jasmin stated that there had been no response from the 
 recent push for new people to join. Cllr Stuart stated he had a very good 
 meeting with Mary Mychaleckyj, Senior Youth Worker at Central Cotswolds Young 
 People’s Project and Emily Hallett of Young Gloucestershire who both had 
 positive ideas on the future of youth projects in the village.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following the visit of Peter Watson at last month’s 
 meeting Cllr Stuart reported that Mr Watson had agreed to make a further four 
 hour long presentation for the general public on January 21st between 2pm and 
 6pm in the Village Hall on the forthcoming switchover from analogue to digital 
 television reception. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman noted that the road closure in Cerney 
 Wick had been postponed because of a health and safety issue which needed to be 
 resolved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had been advised that the guttering which had 
 been left at the rear of the bus shelter were of asbestos and should be 
 disposed of at a regulated site. He will double bag the material and take it to 
 Smiths for disposal.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 24th November along with Cllr Jay, Cllr 
 Nicholas and Cllr Webb, I attended a meeting with Rod Smith at CDC to discuss 
 the complexities of the collection and distribution of the Council Tax in both 
 its forms: Community Charge and Business Rates. Cllr Nicholas précised the 
 meeting and I emailed this to all Parish Councillors who had not been at the 
 meeting. Mr Smith courteously explained the regulations of the tax and we all 
 thanked him for his time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 1st December I accompanied Cllr Stuart to the 
 AGM of the Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association (GPFA) in Tewkesbury 
 where the Upper Up playing field won as Runners Up in the Playing Field of the 
 Year competition. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During November of the 21 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 10 minutes per day which is slightly less than my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp;
 PLAYING FIELDS COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th DECEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Graffiti </b><br>
 As PC Sue Watkins would be introduced to the Parish Council on Wednesday 
 evening it was agreed that she would be asked what progress, if any, had been 
 made in detecting who was responsible for spraying graffiti in parts of the 
 village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris confirmed that he had reported the incidents 
 of graffiti at Robert Franklin Way playing field. Correspondence had been 
 received from Gloucestershire Constabulary that there was insufficient evidence 
 to proceed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wildmoorway Lane</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart stated that due to the excessive rainfall experienced over the 
 autumn and early winter period Wildmoorway Lane is waterlogged. Due to the 
 unfinished refurbishment it is strongly recommended that the path is used with 
 extreme care. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up car park</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart has arranged to meet a contractor to discuss the refurbishment of 
 the Upper Up car park.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kewstoke hedge</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas will report on the condition of Kewstoke hedge at the Parish 
 Council meeting on Wednesday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter, Station Road <br>
 </b>The Clerk was to ask Garrick Outdoor once again to replace the damaged 
 perspex panel to the rear of the shelter. Also to remind Jonathan Roberts 
 Passenger Transport &amp; Projects Officer at Gloucestershire County Council to 
 supply a new timetable and holder for the Limes bus shelter and a timetable for 
 the new shelter at the junction of Station Road and Boxbush. Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 informed the Parish Council that a timetable had been inserted into the holder 
 of the bus shelter in Station Road; Cllr Nicholas likewise reported that a 
 timetable and holder in the Limes bus shelter were now in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow hedge <br>
 </b>The Clerk was to remind Paul Swift at Gloucestershire Highways of his 
 commitment to cut back the hedge, on the south side opposite Lady Fanshawe’s 
 property in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Barracks footpath</b> <br>
 Paul Swift at Gloucestershire Highways if there had been a decision on the 
 warning notices for the Barracks footpath at its access in Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to Cherry tree</b> <br>
 After a discussion it was agreed that a recommendation was put to the Finance 
 committee that James Harris Contracting plants a replacement tree at a cost of 
 £75. Cllr Harris will find the address of the person responsible for damaging 
 the original tree and the Clerk will then ask that person to recompense the 
 Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grass cuttings <br>
 </b>The Committee supports the efforts of the Cricket Club to extend its 
 playing area. The Clerk was to ask the Cricket Club to liaise with the 
 Composting Club regarding the disposal of the grass cuttings.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Pot Holes <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris reported that the pot hole in the vicinity of 5 Robert Franklin 
 Way had been repaired.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play equipment was all in order. Cllr Caunce 
 reported that he had trimmed back the tree mid-way along the southern boundary 
 to give better visibility of the play area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">.<b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. Both 
 Councillors reported that all was in order although the wheels were still off 
 the train. There was yellow painted graffiti on the train roof and carriages, 
 on the senior swings and more on the picnic table. Otherwise the rest of the 
 play equipment was in good order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the area surrounding the cycle mounds was very wet 
 although the facility was not being used very much at present. The hedges have 
 been flailed and the job has been well done. There are still piles of hedge 
 cuttings left by electricity board workers. The footings underneath the youth 
 shelter at Upper Up had not been repaired by Park Leisure. Cllr Harris reported 
 that he had been assured by Scottish and Southern Electric that they would 
 return and chip up the hedge cuttings at a later date.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CLEARANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF THAT AREA OF LAND BETWEEN
 THE MILL STREAM AND BOW WOW</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Harris and Cllr Jay had met in Bow Wow 
 to create a specification of work to clear the bank of the Mill Stream between 
 Silver Street and Lower Mill. The Clerk had contacted Paul Swift at 
 Gloucestershire Highways to ascertain if the bank was under its ownership and 
 if so then a Cultivation Licence would be needed before work could begin. In 
 the meantime the Clerk sent out the tender document to contractors and gave a 
 deadline of 6th January for replies. Cllr Nicholas suggested that Barry 
 Greenaway, GCC Lighting should be contacted to discuss the feasibility of 
 installing low level lighting along Bow Wow as part of the refurbishment.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>APPOINTMENT OF A PREFERRED CONTRACTOR </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After a lengthy discussion the Committee agreed with Cllr 
 Caunce who stated that there was no benefit to the Parish Council in such an 
 appointment. As a consequence of the discussion it was agreed that small jobs 
 are parcelled up to make a more attractive assignment for contractors to give a 
 quotation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to replacing the damaged Cherry tree at the junction of Meadow Way and Clarks 
 Hay at a cost of £75. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROVISION OF A BUS SHELTER NEAR TO THE GATEWAY CENTRE, 
 B4696</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As part of a new motel development on the Spine Road, 
 there is an agreement for the developer to provide a new bus shelter as part of 
 the works. From the map supplied by Jonathan Roberts, Passenger Transport &amp; 
 Projects Officer at GCC the site selected was clearly in Wiltshire and not in 
 the Parish of South Cerney with Cerney Wick. The Committee recommends that the 
 Parish Council rejects the offer. However, it also recommends, as the 
 development is within the Parish consideration should be given to another 
 scheme which would be for the benefit of the community. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council was pleased with the remainder of the 
 highway requirements proposed but as the location of the bus shelter would be 
 in Wiltshire and not serve the residents of South Cerney it did not agree to 
 the adoption of the proposed shelter. The Parish Council would welcome 
 discussions on how the Section 106 contribution might be spent elsewhere in the 
 Parish for the benefit of the community. The Clerk will inform Mr Roberts at 
 GCC.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported that Gypsy Lane was flooded. Cllr 
 Stuart will inform Mike Barton, GCC PROW when he meets up with him in the near 
 future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported a damaged Willow tree up-stream of 
 the bridge over the river Churn, on the old railway track leading away from the 
 play area at Robert Franklin Way, which he considers to be a danger to the 
 public. The tree is now split and needs attention. The Clerk will email Ali 
 Swainston at Cotswold Water Park to inspect it and copy the report to South 
 Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council. Ali Swainston had replied that he had 
 looked at the tree and will take a specialist contractor to inspect it on 
 Thursday. His thoughts were that he would look to coppice the tree in the near 
 future. Ali will advise the Parish Council of his plans. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported a damaged drain cover in School 
 Lane, 15 yards from the junction with Silver Street on the southern edge of the 
 carriageway. The Clerk will report the incident to Paul Swift at 
 Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas noted that the PROW BSC12 was in need of 
 repair. BSC12 is the PROW which leaves the Old George car park and continues 
 alongside the Mill Stream to the bridge at Lower Mill. Cllr Stuart will inform 
 Mike Barton when he next meets up with him. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the Playing Field at Upper Up 
 had been judged as Runner Up in Gloucestershire competition organised by GPFA. 
 Cllr Stuart accepted a prize of £75 on behalf of the Parish Council at the AGM 
 of the Association in Tewkesbury. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on a sewage leak in the vicinity of 
 Kingfisher Place. A sewage pump had blown a fuse and effluent had entered the 
 surface water drains. Work on the banks of Lake 16 had apparently compromised 
 the drainage. Thames Water had promptly repaired the fuse and cleaned up the 
 resulting mess and Gloucestershire Highways had determined that the highway 
 drain to Lake 16 had been adopted and would take action to clear it. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to enquire from Gloucestershire 
 Highways if there had been any update on when work would begin in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to inform Paul Swift that the grips in 
 Bow Wow were blocked and the carriageway was flooding as a consequence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Bloor Homes had emailed a request to reopen negotiations 
 regarding the possibility of the Parish Council adopting the public open space 
 within Winchcombe Gardens. The Committee agreed that its stance had not 
 changed. CDC had attached conditions to its planning permission regarding the 
 installation of play equipment which it had not enforced and could not now 
 expect the Parish Council to take on its responsibility. The Committee 
 recommends that the stance taken previously by the Parish Council remains 
 unchanged. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.38pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON
 MONDAY 7th DECEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Jay, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.40pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 Members of the Committee who had attended the meeting with Rod Smith at CDC to 
 discuss the collection and distribution of the Council Tax agreed that it was 
 very satisfactory and informative.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay noted that the expenditure detailed on the spread sheet for period 8 
 was in order. Village maintenance expenditure was below budget.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee had recommended that the 
 Finance Committee agrees to the cost of replacing the damaged Cherry tree at 
 the corner of Meadow Way and Clarks Hay for £75. The Finance Committee agreed 
 to the recommendation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Webb 
 that the Parish Council accepts the recommendation of the Finance Committee. 
 The Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr Harris who abstained, was all in 
 favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Provision of a Bus Shelter near Gateway Centre, B4696</b>
 <br>
 Committee members had been party to the discussion held by the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance committee and concurred with their decision and 
 recommendation.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>LAND ON WHICH SCOUT HUT IS ERECTED</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Tiina Emsley, Principal Planning Policy Officer at CDC had 
 confirmed to Cllr Nicholas that the Scout Hut land had not been “earmarked” for 
 housing, nor had it been considered as part of the SHLAA and agreed to include 
 it as part of the community’s aspirations for the South Cerney Settlement 
 Strategy. The Committee recommends that the Parish Council agrees to enlist the 
 help of its Ward Councillors in securing the land for the use of the community 
 and not for development by persuading Chris Vickery of its special position in 
 the LDF. At the Parish Council meeting members supported the view of Cllr 
 Nicholas who was in favour of designating the site as a precious asset within 
 the LDF. Cllr Nicholas reported that Mr Paul Duncliffe had been in contact with 
 him to enquire if the area might be considered as an exception site for the 
 development of 100% social housing and asked if the Parish Council would be 
 comfortable to enter into discussions regarding the building of such homes. He 
 emphasised that the Parish Council was not trying to benefit from such a 
 development. No members of the Parish Council objected to a meeting with Mr 
 Duncliffe, although Cllr Mrs Land did abstain as she was a close neighbour of 
 the site.</p>

 As this site was in a rural setting and too close to the rest of the village, 
 if permission was granted, it would set a precedent for the proliferation of 
 more of these cabins. There was no proof that demand justified the proposed

 available. No official quota had been set, on a percentage basis of 
 availability, as was the case with car parking slots. <br>

 forward by Cotswold District Council and the Cotswold Water Park Society Joint 
 Committee. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr Webb that the 
 Parish Council agrees to the recommendation of the Planning Committee. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ALLOTMENTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart stated that as the Diocese had refused to 
 consider reopening the old allotments at the end of School Lane the Parish 
 Council should look into the feasibility of using the land behind the tennis 
 courts at Upper Up as allotment gardens. It is likely that at least a dozen 
 plots could be provided on the site. There would be a need to secure the plot 
 on two sides as the other sides had fences and hedges which would be 
 satisfactory. Other problems such as the provision of water and management 
 could be overcome. Cllr Stuart was aware of about 15 to 20 people interested in 
 acquiring an allotment in the village. Although Cllr Harris was not against the 
 idea he had reservations on the practicality of the scheme and wondered if 
 there was not a more suitable location. It was agreed not to vote on the motion 
 on the agenda. Nevertheless the Parish Councillors accepted that the Parish 
 Council is minded to proceed with investigating the possibilities. Cllr Stuart 
 will make further enquiries as to planning approval and other costs involved 
 and report back, in time, to the Parish Council.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge asked why this Parish did not ask for a 
 speed camera sign similar to one in Siddington. Cllr Mrs Tunbridge was very 
 concerned at the speed of traffic, especially in Silver Street as it enters the 
 village. Cllr Mrs Land agreed that when she visited a friend at the rear of the 
 army barracks traffic speed seemed excessive. Cllr Stuart explained that the 
 various monitoring exercises carried out did not give cause for alarm although 
 he did admit that there were always the exceptions. He advised Parish 
 Councillors to attend the next meeting of the Police Neighbourhood Panel and 
 raise their concerns at that venue. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris complained about the state of the highway in 
 Bow Wow. The Clerk will ask CDC to send a road sweeper to clean it up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley complained about the amount of street 
 rubbish, including dog faeces which was littering the area of Berkeley Close 
 and Beverstone Road. The Clerk will ask the Cotswold Wardens at CDC to patrol 
 the area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had attended a Community Land Trust meeting 
 organised by GRCC with Cllr Stuart on Friday 27th November at Churchdown 
 Community Centre. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jenkins (CDC) reported that a meeting to be chaired 
 by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP had been arranged for Friday March 5th to discuss 
 developments at Cotswold Water Park. He encouraged Parish Councillors to 
 attend. Written questions should be submitted prior to the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart and the Clerk had attended the AGM of the 
 Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association AGM in Tewkesbury and collected a 
 cheque for £75 and a commemorative plaque as the prize awarded to the Runners 
 Up in the Gloucestershire Playing Field of the Year competition. During the 
 month he had met with Mary Mychaleckyj and Emily Hallett, youth workers for 
 Young Gloucestershire. On 8th December Cllr Stuart attended a Community Group 
 Survey PPG17 meeting at CDC. He informed the organisers that a survey 
 circulated of facilities and equipment within the parish was not accurate. Only 
 four parish and town councils were represented. There had been two such 
 meetings in the District at which a total of 10 councils had been represented 
 which was still a very low turnout. Cllr Stuart complained to the organisers 
 about the access to the facilities at the Water Park and commented that the 
 title of Water Park did not describe the facility truthfully. </p>
