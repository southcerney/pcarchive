    all in favour. Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark informed the members that enforcement action would be taken 
    out against Westbury Homes at the end of the month.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    In July of the 22 available working days I averaged 3 hrs 12 mins per day. 
    Today is the final day any resident may inspect the accounts. To date not 
    one resident enforced his/her democratic right although the information is 
    also published on the Parish Council’s web site.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    As Berkeley Close residents were in attendance, specifically to take part in 
    the debate about the proposed development in that part of the village, the 
    Chairman promoted the Planning element of the agenda.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on 9 August and began with the application which was of interest to 
    the assembled members of the public.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2443/O</b><br>
    Applicant: J. S. Bloor (Tewkesbury) Ltd, King John’s Galler, King John’s 
    Island, Mythe Road, Tewkesbury, Glos GL20 6ED<br>
    Construction of 22 dwellings and associated works on land at 63-80 Berkeley 
    Close, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    OBJECTION (as below)<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2443/P</b><br>
    Applicant: J. S. Bloor (Tewkesbury) Ltd, King John’s Galler, King John’s 
    Island, Mythe Road, Tewkesbury, Glos GL20 6ED<br>
    Construction of 24 dwellings and associated works on land at 63-80 Berkeley 
    Close, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    The Clerk had written to Cllr M. Baines (CDC), Cllr C. E. Bennett (CDC), 
    Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC) expressing the concern of the Planning Committee.<br>
    Mrs Doris Land presented a copy of a letter objecting to the development she 
    had sent to Cotswold District Council. Cllr Nicholas congratulated Mrs Land 
    on the precise composition of her letter to Marcus Kitchen.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed with the Planning Committee which had been 
    profoundly concerned that permission to build was being sought on this site. 
    Thames Water plc, the Environment Agency, Cotswold District Council and 
    Fosseway Housing should demonstrate that the original problems of sewerage 
    and surface water disposal had been addressed. It was obvious from recent 
    events in July and August this year that a problem still exists which 
    originally caused the demolition of the flats. The public open space on the 
    plan was not an effective replacement for the existing play area next to the 
    scout hut. The Parish Council agreed to request a Condition, if permission 
    was granted, that 40% of the dwellings should be allocated as affordable 
    housing. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that she had been in contact with CDC 
    planners who will insist that the infrastructure will cope with the new 
    development. Cllr Nicholas asked that the Clerk request a historic report 
    from the four agencies involved of what did they decide was needed, what did 
    they do, what remains to be done to remedy the problems and what additional 
    infrastructure is needed to build the new development? The Clerk was asked 
    to write to the Scout Association about any lease they might have agreed on 
    the use of the land. He was also to enquire from Fosseway Housing 
    Association and J.S. Bloor Ltd if they were aware of any such lease.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0776/R</b><br>

    Erection of a new dwelling on land adjacent to Walnut Tree Farmhouse, Upper 
    Up, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Ginny Hemming CDC Forestry Officer should be alerted that the new position 
    of the dwelling did not move close to the root system of the two mature 
    sycamores.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.8421/A</b><br>

    Applicant: Mr &amp; Mrs Clark, 3 Broadway Cottages, Broadway Lane, South Cerney,

    Council accept the recommendations of the Planning Committee on the previous 
    two applications. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    Cllr Stuart rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <br>

    Deerhurst, Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5QH<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the 
    Parish Council accept the recommendations of the Planning Committee on the 
    previous application. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.4031/H</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr &amp; Mrs K. Isles, Atkyns Lodge, Atkyns Manor, Silver Street, 
    South Cerney, Glos.<br>
    Replace existing flat roof on ancillary outbuilding with a pitched roof 
    covered in reconstructed stone tiles/slates at Atkyns Lodge, Silver Street, 
    South Cerney, Glos.<br>

    the specification of the reconstructed/reconstituted stone tiles be of a 
    suitably high quality, similar to those used on Bridge House, and as

    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and 
    Playing Fields Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Ham Lane/Sudeley Drive Ramp</b><br>
    GCC Highways had written to inform the Parish Council that the grass verge 
    in Sudeley Drive which borders with Ham Lane is public highway to the hedge 
    line. Before proceeding to install a ramp the Parish Council should seek 
    legal advice and if positive GCC Highways would carry out a search with the 
    utility companies to identify the location of their underground apparatus. 
    The Parish Council asked the Clerk to enquire from its insurers if it would 
    be covered for public liability or if the policy could be extended if it 
    went ahead and installed a ramp.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Footpath Work at Church Lane/Bow Wow</b><br>
    Cllr Squire confirmed that the ‘as dug’ gravel and edging boards had been 
    supplied within the agreed budget and work on the footpath was proceeding 
    slowly.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart is still working on the plan and will call a meeting of the sub 
    committee when ready.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Basketball Apparatus, Upper Up</b><br>
    Vandals had broken the basketball apparatus at Upper Up on 12 July and R.O.W. 
    Berry was ordered to make the equipment safe. The Committee recommend that 
    the Finance Committee approve his quote to remove, repair and replace the 
    basketball post for £145 and further, to renew the back board on the 
    basketball post for £65. The culprits had been caught and promised Cllr 
    Stuart that they would pay for the damage. Unfortunately no payment had yet 
    been received. WPC Nicky Nolan informed Cllr Stuart that she would be 
    contacting the individuals responsible.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Up Tower Slide</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that Julie Tegg (GPFA) informed him that as the 
    inspector’s report had categorised the climbing entrance to the slide as 
    ‘low risk’ the disabling board which had been attached had been unnecessary 
    and could be removed. Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart volunteered to remove the 
    board. On inspection it was discovered that the climbing rungs had been 
    removed when the climbing board had been added. The Clerk was to ask 
    Macventure Play Co to quote to reinstall the rungs and what discount might 
    be given for the board.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cycle Mounds</b><br>
    Four quotations to cut and strim the weeds and herbage on the cycle mounds 
    had been received. The Finance Committee had agreed to the recommendation of 
    the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee that the lowest quote 
    of £100 received from Adrian Gibbs be accepted.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Blocked Drains in Broadway Lane</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to request GCC Highways to send a team to clear the 
    gutters in Broadway Lane.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Police Invitation</b><br>

    representative be invited to attend a Parish Council meeting to discuss 
    policing in the village.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Invitation to Tim Pain, Chief Executive, Cotswold Water Park</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to arrange a meeting with Tim Pain, who had recently 
    been appointed Chief Executive at the Cotswold Water Park.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that there was a continuing problem with the safety 
    tiles although the situation was no worse than previous. Various items which 
    included a motorbike, barbecue, a traffic cone and four plastic garden 
    chairs had been removed from the lake. The new goal posts had been installed 
    although arrangements were in hand to move them to a less contentious part 
    of the play area.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb gave the report on behalf of Cllr Harris who was on holiday. 
    Cllr Mrs Chubb noted that the seat by the picnic table had been chipped on 
    the right hand side and the fourth spar of the high fence on the Lakeside 
    boundary was broken. All the equipment was now serviceable. Cllr Squire 
    reported that A&amp;B Fencing had advised that the two-way opening gate which 
    had been ordered could be a danger to young users. The Committee agreed that 
    a gate which opened outwards only would suffice. Cllr Squire agreed to 
    inform A&amp;B Fencing. The Committee had recommended and the Finance Committee 
    approved the final payment of £1,000 to Macventure Play Co. Cllr Stuart 
    asked the Clerk to prepare a notice for all play areas which informed users 
    who to contact in case of accident and/or emergency and where the nearest 
    public telephone was situated.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    In her report Cllr Mrs Chapman said that she had been assured by the Village 
    Chairman that when everyone was back from holiday a working party will be 
    assembled to replace the wire fence. Besides the paint flaking on the swing 
    and the bin needing to be emptied the rest of the play area was all in 
    order.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Aircraft Noise</b><br>
    The Committee approved a letter Cllr Stuart composed in response to item 44 
    in correspondence.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Mole Nuisance at Upper Up Cricket Pitch</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to check with Valerie Hancock (Davey Franklin Jones, 
    Solicitors) on the conditions of the licence/lease granted to the Cricket 
    Club to determine who is responsible for removing the pests. John Hunt, a 
    member of the Cricket Club, had informed Cllr Stuart that an expert would 
    advise the club on how to proceed with the pest problem.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Temporary Structure on Upper Up playing field</b><br>
    South Cerney Cricket Club had asked permission from the Parish Council to 
    site a temporary structure for storage on the Upper Up playing field. The 
    Parish Council had no objections although it asked the Clerk to inform the 
    Cricket Club should ascertain from CDC if planning permission was necessary.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Circular Bridleway at Lake 16</b><br>
    The Clerk was to enquire from Malcolm Watt at CDC if there was evidence to 
    support the creation of a bridle path on the north bank of Lake 16 to 
    complete the 8 mile circular bridle path of the Cotswold Water Park.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Overhanging Trees</b><br>
    In response to a complaint of overhanging trees from Mrs S. Davis, Cllr 
    Squire has determined that they are the property of the Parish Council 
    planted in 1977 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen 
    Elizabeth II.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Blocked GuttersCT.4031/H</b><br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>RISK ASSESSMENT</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Nicholas who had suggested that further 
    risks which should be included were Clerk’s Serious Illness, the storage of 
    the electronic back up information and the Chairman’s Illness. Cllr Stuart 
    asked if GRCC might be persuaded to create a ‘locum’ post for absent Clerks. 
    The Clerk had fire proof storage for electronic back-up. There would be a 
    risk to the continuity of Parish Council business if the Chairman was taken 
    ill although the risk could be assessed as C2 with the Vice Chairman to take 
    over if such an incident occurred. Vandalism on the playing fields could be 
    assessed as category C1.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PERSONNEL COMMITTEE</b><br>
    The Personnel Committee agreed to meet on Tuesday 17 August at Cllr Stuart’s 
    home to discuss the Clerk’s annual assessment and the national wage award.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>ZEBRA CROSSING</b><br>
    A letter and petition in favour of a zebra crossing had been received from 
    Mrs J. Roberts. Her letter described the outcome of a meeting she had 
    organised with Parish Councillors Mrs Pollard, Squires and Stuart, District 
    Councillor Mrs Clark, PC R. Wyatt and eight other residents on the siting of 
    a zebra crossing. The Parish Council debated the necessity of a crossing but 
    as this was not an agenda item the Clerk advised that no decisions could be 
    taken. It was agreed that the Clerk include the zebra crossing as an item on 
    next month’s agenda.<br>

    <b>COUNCILLOR’S REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that all the manhole covers in Kingfisher Place had 
    been blown off and now needed to be resealed. There was another in Sudeley 
    Drive but he was not sure which utility it belonged to and he would inform 
    the Clerk.<br>
    Cllr Webb suggested that the provision of an interactive speed notice should 
    be attained. Cllr Squire had taken delivery of such a unit that afternoon. 
    He would be siting it in the village and asked for volunteers to supervise 
    its operation.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard asked that damage to the carriageway in the vicinity of 
    Sunset Cottage in Station Road be reported to GCC Highways.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb complained at the height and amount of weeds in the ditch in 
    Station Road. Cllr Stuart assured her that they would be strimmed later in 
    the year.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the traffic cones which notified a collapsed 
    ditch at the side of the road through Cerney Wick kept falling into the 
    hole.<br>
    Cllr Smith reported on a meeting of the Cotswold Water Park Joint Liaison 
    Committee he had attended on the 22 July. Overall he found it very 
    interesting and informed the Parish Council that the Water Park was set to 
    double in size over the next five years. A 100 yard mock up of how the canal 
    will look after its restoration was on demonstration. In reply to a question 
    about the Water Park’s relationship with local commercial organisations Tony 
    Pain the new Chief Executive replied that it was very good with the 
    exception of Water Mark.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas complained that temporary signs to direct traffic to local 
    events were being left on show long after the event had finished and asked 
    that organisers be requested to take them down sooner when the exhibition 
    was over.<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting organised as a Comprehensive Performance 
    Assessment he had attended at CDC on 16 July. It was a disappointing turn 
    out with only 14 out of the 115 parishes in the CDC area being represented. 
    A full report was awaited but damming views on the Planning Department were 
    put forward and the ruling junta was criticised for increasing the car 
    parking charges and killing democracy in the local area.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 10.15pm.</td>
