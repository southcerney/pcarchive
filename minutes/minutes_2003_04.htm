    <td>There were three members of the public present. The Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner
    opened the meeting at 7.35 pm and welcomed the assembled Councillors to the final meeting
    of this term.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Stuart and Cllr Jones (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 12 MARCH 2003</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas requested that the following text be added to the item on Golf Balls on page
    1 after the sentence ending ... second tee. &quot;Mr Franklin said that players on the
    first two holes will be directed not to tee off when they can see footpath users who were
    in a position putting them at risk to a mis-hit shot.&quot; It was proposed by Cllr Dunn
    and seconded by Cllr Mrs Spriggs that the Minutes were a true and accurate record. The
    Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    Planning response forms were faxed to CDC Planning and applications filed.<br>
    All payments to suppliers were dispatched.<br>
    All tenderers for ground maintenance contracts were informed whether or not successful.<br>
    Copies of letters written were passed to the Chairperson Cllr Mrs J. Gardiner for her
    information.<br>
    I purchased green slime removal solution for £4.99 from petty cash and passed it to Cllr
    Gardiner for application on the safety tiles.<br>
    I met with D. Taylor and discussed the possibility of constructing a footpath on the
    western side of Upper Up between the ramp and the car park. He dismissed the idea as any
    footpath there would have to be over the culvert.<br>
    I contacted Mr Timbrell and asked him to quote at a per metre price for rail fencing on
    Upper Up car park.<br>
    I spoke twice with Melanie Cox, Assistant Countryside Agency Officer regarding the
    application for part funding of the play equipment. Item 23 of the correspondence refers
    and I passed a copy of this to Cllr King for action. I have tried to contact PC Gwillym
    for proof of evidence regarding the damage to the noticeboard but Police Reception at
    Cirencester due to the increase in activity at RAF Fairford has not been able to help at
    the moment.<br>
    I spoke with Gary Handley at GCC Highways who agreed to supply, on loan, a speed detection
    radar. Later I spoke with Alf Reynolds also from GCC Highways who has added South Cerney
    to his list of Parish Councils awaiting a loan. He expected to supply the equipment and
    uniforms with the next four weeks and I would ask Parish Councillors to volunteer to
    operate the equipment and record the results.<br>
    I have had a reply from Deborah Smith CDC Planning Officer on the Conditions which apply
    to the planning permission granted to the Cheltenham Housing Association in Mill Close and
    Box Bush. There were no conditions attached to the houses but permission should be sought
    if the outside of the flats was to be materially changed.<br>
    Over the course of the period I have tried on several occasions to contact Cornhill
    Insurance to provide a quote for safety inspections without success. Of the services
    contacted eg RoSPA, National Playing Fields Association, Macventure Play Co and Wicksteed,
    Wicksteed would be the cheapest. Since composing this report Cornhill Insurance and the
    National Playing Fields have given quotes. (See Safety Inspections report.)<br>
    Literature received from RoSPA states that it is a legal requirement to have the play
    areas assessed for suitability of use by disabled people by 1 January 2004. RoSPA has
    developed an assessment system which meets the requirements of the Act and can undertake a
    formal assessment of the sites as required by the Act at the same time as completing the
    safety inspection for an additional fee of £33.50 (plus VAT).<br>
    As agreed I kept a record of time spent on Parish Council duties in March. Of the 21
    working days in March I logged 78 hours which I averages 3.71 hours per day.<br>
    Over the period this represents 15 hours extra to my contract or approximately 3.5 hours
    per week. There is no doubt that since I became Clerk 5 years ago the work load has
    steadily increased and I ask that the Parish Council considers increasing my contracted
    time from 15 hours to 18.5 hours per week.<br>
    I would like to take this opportunity, to thank you especially Madam Chairman, and all
    other members of this Parish Council, for the support and trust you have given me during
    the term of this Council. Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT AND SALARY AWARD</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported that the Parish Council had agreed to the recommendation of the
    Personnel Committee to promote the Clerk to Scale 20 from Scale 19 effective from 1 April
    2002. Scale 21 is the highest promotion that can be obtained based on a population of
    5,000 and under. The Clerk's new pay rise based on the recommendation of NALC is effective
    from 1 April 2003. The Clerk's request that the Parish Council considers increasing his
    contracted hours from 15 to 18.5 hours per week was adjourned to the first meeting of the
    new Parish Council in May. Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to continue to record his time
    spent on Parish Council duties.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Golf Balls</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Spriggs reported that she had visited the Golf Course and was impressed with the
    new safety arrangements. She suggested that Mr Franklin be asked to erect one further sign
    on the stile from Webb's field to the Canal and a letter be sent to Mr Franklin expressing
    the Parish Council's appreciation of his co-operation in the matter. the Parish Council
    was in agreement.<br>
    <strong>Grant Application for Play Equipment</strong><br>
    Cllr King reported that plans were in hand to conform with the criteria suggested by the
    Countryside Agency for a successful grant application. He was preparing a petition for
    villagers to show that better facilities were needed on the Robert Franklin Way playing
    field and drafting a case to prove that as the youth of the village comprised one-third of
    the population of 3,200 the existence two playing fields was essential.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 7
    April.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>CT.8163/D</strong><br>
    The Clerk had ascertained from Mr M. Grace (Enforcement Officer) that he had written to Ms
    Lloyd on the 4 April giving her 14 days notice to abide with the conditions of the
    planning permission for the wall at Orchard House.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Replacement Windows in Boxbush Road &amp; Mill Close</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to obtain the conditions associated with the granted planning
    permission for the houses, bungalows and the flat in Boxbush Road and Mill Close from
    Deborah Smith, Planning Officer at CDC.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Mineral Extraction Conditions on CAMAS site</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that he had written to both CDC and GCC planning authorities and sent
    them copies of each other's correspondence. Ms Lucy Binnie GCC had requested a map of the
    area concerned and it had been provided. CDC had acknowledged the correspondence.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications Received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <strong>CT.1599/B</strong><br>
    Erection of one (1) dwelling at Morning Dew, Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos.<br>

    new septic tank being too close.<br>
    NO OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    <strong>CT.1854/A</strong><br>
    Erection of detached garage at Hailwood, Station Road, South Cerney<br>

    <strong>CT.2380/2/V</strong><br>
    Change of use of OE' field from touring caravans to static holiday caravans at Caravan

    <strong>CT.4017/A</strong><br>
    Replacement timber hut with stonework building at gauging station at Mill House, Cerney
    Wick, Cirencester<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.4233/G</strong><br>
    New changing room facility at Playing Fields, Upper Up, South Cerney<br>
    The positioning of the structure will clash significantly with the Upper Up park
    development. Concern was expressed with the materials to be used in construction. For
    example the decra profiled tile sheets and the render of the walls with sandstone and red
    brick. The Parish Council was happy with the principle of a new changing room facility.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.8302</strong><br>
    Two storey extension to side and single storey extension to rear at 8 Broadway Lane, South
    Cerney, Cirencester<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Parish
    Council agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to ratify its
    decision on CT.1599/B. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CDC Ref: 0300865NEI North Wilts DC Ref: 03/00782/COU</strong><br>
    Use of Lake 62 Cotswold Water Park for personal watercraft members club and activity
    centre by North Wilts District Council<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the activities planned would be extremely noisy and
    intrusive. Activities on Lake 62 will influence residents of South Cerney greatly because
    of its position and the prevailing wind.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Dunn to object to this
    application. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications Granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <strong>CT.0144/4/P</strong><br>

    2. The unit of retail accommodation shall be used solely for the sale of non-food items
    and goods related to outdoor leisure and not for any other retail purpose including
    another use in Class A1 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes)
    Order 1987 or the equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument amending or
    replacing the 1987 Order or any change of use permitted by the Town and Country (General
    Permitted Development) Order 1995.<br>
    Reason: It is essential that the Local Planning Authority retains control over the use of
    the premises because of its open countryside location within the Cotswold Water Park.
    Another planning application will be necessary if it is proposed to change the use of the
    premises to any other than that specified in this condition. This condition is appropriate
    in the light of advice within PPG1 and Circular 11/95.<br>
    3. Any use of the building for mail order purposes shall be strictly ancillary to the main
    use of the premises for on-site retail purposes to visiting members of the public.<br>
    Reason: As no 2.<br>
    The Clerk had obtained the Section 106 agreement associated with the permission<br>

    <strong>CT.0006/3/J CAMAS APPEAL</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Mrs Spriggs attended the informal appeal inquiry held on 8 April to
    decide on whether Westbury Homes (Holding) Ltd be granted permission to build 30 houses on
    the CAMAS site. Cllr Nicholas reported on proceedings of which the main argument from CDC
    was that if permission was granted then a precedent would be set in terms of the current
    Local Plan. Paul Fong argued on behalf of Westbury Homes (Holding) Ltd that 30 houses was
    on a much smaller scale than the previous application. GCC Highways made no comment on
    traffic flows. No reference was made to the wooded area. The inquiry revealed that
    Westbury Homes (Holding) Ltd was in breach of a planning condition of Phase 1 when they
    erected a wooden fence to divide the site instead of a stone wall although no action was
    envisaged before the outcome of the inquiry which should be within 4 to 6 weeks.
    Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner thanked Cllr Nicholas for his report and Cllr Mrs Spriggs
    for their attendance at the inquiry.<br>

    <strong>Noticeboard Repair</strong><br>
    The Clerk had written to Mr R. Hewer on 28 March 2003 requesting that he reimburse South
    Cerney Parish Council £295.00 for the repair of the noticeboard. The Parish Council
    agreed that if payment was not forthcoming by the 28 April then legal action be
    threatened.<br>
    <strong>Audit Commission</strong><br>
    A reminder for payment of its outstanding account had been received from the Audit
    Commission. The Clerk had responded requesting an answer to his letter of 18 February
    2002. The Parish Council agreed that the demand be returned with a copy of the original
    letter asking the Audit Commission not to pursue payment until it gives a substantive
    reply.<br>
    <strong>Internal Auditor</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr Gardiner declared a prejudicial interest and left the debate.

    <strong>2002-2003 Budget</strong><br>
    The Committee considered that as the Parish Council expenditure in the year 2002-2003 was
    only 2% over budget it proved its forecast had been very accurate for the period.<br>

    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 9 April.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up Ramp</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that he had discussed with D. Taylor (GCC Highways) the provision of a
    footpath on the western side of Upper Up between the ramp and the car park. Mr Taylor
    rejected this idea as there was a culvert there. Cllr King asked the Clerk to find out
    exactly where the culvert was in relation to the ramp, especially if the landing area of
    the ramp near the carriageway had to be lengthened. The Clerk was asked to contact the DDA
    office for names of architects/designers who would be capable of preparing plans for the
    alteration of the ramp.<br>
    <strong>Wildmoorway Lane</strong><br>
    On behalf of Cllr Harris the Clerk had learned from D. Taylor (GCC Highways)that most of
    Wildmoorway Lane was a bridleway and not eligible for speed limits. Cllr Mrs Gardiner
    remarked that as the beginning of the lane to just beyond the bridge was the
    responsibility of GCC Highways speed restriction signs there would deter traffic from
    speeding on that part of the lane.<br>
    <strong>Children at Play signs</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris requested that the Clerk enquire if was possible to erect Children at Play
    signs at the entrance to Jubilee Gardens. It was becoming increasingly dangerous for
    children at play through the accumulation of parked vehicles in the vicinity of the
    entrance to Jubilee Gardens and the nearby public house.<br>
    <strong>Stile at Wildmoorway Lane/Wildmoorway Meadows</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform Cotswold Water Park that the stile at the far end of
    Wildmoorway Lane leading to Wildmoorway Meadows was in a dangerous state and in need of
    replacement. River Churn downstream of the Spine Road bridge Cllr Harris asked the Clerk
    to inform the Environment Agency that a large amount of logs and débris had accumulated
    in the river Churn downstream of the Spine Road bridge.<br>
    <strong>Flower Tubs</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart emailed a request that the Parish Council considers providing flower tubs for
    the four village gateways which volunteers would plant and service. The Clerk had
    ascertained from D. Taylor (GCC Highways) that if the tubs were placed between the posts
    supporting the village signs there would be no objection to this scheme. Cllr Mrs Chapman
    volunteered to contact Mike Chamberlain to see if his company would provide concrete tubs
    to hold the plants. The Parish Council was all in favour of the idea. <br>
    <strong>Radar Speed Gun</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that Alf Reynolds (GCC Highways) would provide a radar speed gun on
    loan to the Parish Council on Thursday 10 April. Four pairs of Councillors volunteered to
    operate the gun and record its findings which would then be analysed by GCC Highways: Cllr
    Nicholas and Cllr Mrs Spriggs; Cllr King and Cllr Dunn; Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Harris;
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr Mrs Pearse.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner carried out the safety inspections for the period. Cllr Gardiner reported
    that ongoing problems still existed. He had sprayed the safety surfaces on the playing
    fields with a slime remover. Cllr Stuart will carry out the next round of inspections.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CYCLE RACKS</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to contact Ms Teresa Alexander for an update on their
    provision. In a letter dated 18 February 2002 the Clerk had written to Dr S. Pickering
    confirming that the Parish Council agreed that the racks could be located at each of the
    three play areas (Upper Up, Robert Franklin Way and Cerney Wick), outside the Village Hall
    by the staddle stones, at the end of Church Lane near the gate to the allotments, at the
    bus shelter and the Laurels. Cllr Mrs Pearse had confirmed that the Vicar would not object
    to a cycle rack to be placed inside the churchyard. Dr S. Pickering had emailed the Clerk
    to confirm that the racks would be installed shortly.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>SAFETY INSPECTIONS</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that he had contacted various organisations to quote for the safety
    inspection of play areas. Results to date were: Cornhill Insurance ­ £600; National
    Playing Fields Association ­ £480; RoSPA ­ £59 per site up to 5 items of play
    equipment plus £2.50 for each additional item; Macventure Play Co. ­ £299; Wicksteed
    Leisure ­ £30 per site unaccompanied or £50 per site accompanied. Literature received
    from RoSPA stated that it is a legal requirement to have the play areas assessed for
    suitability of use by disabled people by 1 January 2004. RoSPA has developed an assessment
    system which meets the requirements of the Act and can undertake a formal assessment of
    the sites as required by the Act at the same time as completing the safety inspection for
    an additional fee of £33.50 (plus VAT). It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded
    by Cllr Harris to appoint RoSPA to carry out the annual safety inspection of play
    equipment and the DDA assessment. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    The Parish Council agreed to the proposed extension of the 30mph speed limit to the
    Evergreen Industrial Park on Broadway Lane and the removal of the existing 30mph speed
    limit and gateway feature. However, after some discussion, the Parish Council agreed that
    it did not want to have a physical gateway feature but rather a visual version. It
    suggested that the gateway be moved some short distance south away from in front of
    residential properties. Moreover, it would also like a radar operated mobile speed limit
    sign at the nearer gateway to the village which could be transferred on a rotation basis
    to the other three village entrances.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris complained that the alterations to the Children's Slide at Upper Up excluded
    younger children from using it. Cllr Nicholas said that the slide had been redesigned
    purposely for this reason as in a previous annual safety inspection report it had been
    reported as dangerous. Nevertheless Cllr Harris asked that the Clerk enquire from
    Macventure Play for an estimate to supplement the hand grips with larger ones which would
    make the equipment more accessible to younger children.<br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to write to Mr Francis to complete the tarmac project, to the
    start of the public right of way which exits the car park at the end of Boxbush Road.
    Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner thanked members of the Parish Council and Ward Councillors
    for their support during her period as Chairperson. Parish Councillors unanimously
    returned the compliment for her contribution as Chairperson during her term of office.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner closed the meeting at 10pm. </td>
