    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 7th APRIL 2004</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify">The meeting began at 7pm with Chairman Cllr Stuart 
    welcoming the Community Safety Officer, Les Haines who introduced himself 
    explaining that his background was that of a Police Chief Inspector now 
    retired. He informed Parish Councillors that his position was funded from 
    London through Bristol and consequently the Cotswold District Council. The 
    post will end its three year cycle next Spring when an audit of its 
    activities will take place to determine the priorities and which problems 
    need to be highlighted. Part of his mission was to ensure that public 
    projects should be planned to take account of their potential impact on 
    crime and not to make the situation worse. Fear of crime he continued is 
    disproportionately high in this area which is probably due to the higher 
    than normal average age of the population. He assured Parish Councillors 
    that this was not in fact the reality. Target response time for Police to 
    arrive at an incident was 20 minutes and a success rate of 90% was being 
    achieved. Funding was available to divert youth away from crime through the 
    provision of youth shelters and youth cafés. Extra funds for youth provision 
    provides finance to extend workers time for supervision of suitable 
    projects. He went on to explain the Cotswold Crime and Reduction Partnership 
    belonging to which was a legal requirement for the primary members: Glos 
    County Council, Cotswold District Council, Police and PCTs (Primary Care 
    Trusts). Membership of the secondary tier was expanding to include for 
    example Gay and Lesbian groups. Mr Haines assured Parish Council Chairman 
    Michael Stuart that he would liaise with him to gather, provide data, 
    research and facilitate fact finding on behalf of the forthcoming Village 
    Plan. Cllr Nicholas pointed out that there was a deficiency in the provision 
    of indoor facilities for the youth of the village to which Les Haines 
    replied that funds were available for projects such as a youth café or even 
    an indoor skateboard facility. The Chairman thanked Les Haines for his 
    presentation and promised to keep in touch.</p>

    The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    An apology has been received from Cllr Smith for his absence.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 10 MARCH 2004</b><br>
    Page 1805: Pedestrian Crossing(s) ­ 2nd line delete Anderson replace with 
    &quot;Andrews&quot;<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. Cllr Caunce abstained 
    and the remainder of the Parish Council was all in favour. Chairman Cllr 
    Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Pedestrian Crossing(s)</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the meeting he attended with Dot Stephens, 
    Catherine Isles and Sue Andrews. Contact will be made with GCC Safe Routes 
    to School to determine specific locations for the proposed crossing(s). The 
    Head Teacher from Anne Edwards School had assured the lollipop lady that her 
    position would not be in jeopardy if the crossing(s) were installed.<br>
    <b>CT.1454/3/Y</b><br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) informed the Parish Council that permission had been 
    granted by CDC members that afternoon although the CDC Planning Department 
    had argued that there was no functional need.<br>
    <b>CT.8163/J</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart complained about the lack of notification from the CDC on the 
    removal of willow tree at Orchard House which was in the Conservation Area. 
    It was stated by CDC that the tree had reached the end of its useful life 
    and could therefore be cut down. Cllr Jay asked that the documentation, 
    relating to the condition of the tree on which the decision must have been 
    taken, be inspected. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the meeting that two 
    mature trees, a silver birch and a pine, would be planted as replacements. 
    Cllr Stuart stated that local residents had lost their confidence in the 
    Planning Department at CDC. Cllr Bennett (CDC) defended the Department by 
    saying that if no regulation had been broken then there was little other 
    course of action than to give the event permission. Cllr Nicholas suggested 
    to the CDC Members present that planning procedures at CDC could be more 
    rigorously policed and interactive to prevent a recurrence.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK'S REPORT</b><br>
    On March 15th Cllr Stuart and I met Alan Thompson from Community Services 
    and discussed various tasks which might be suitable for those serving 
    Community Service Orders. Two assignments suggested were of interest to Mr 
    Thompson. First was to repaint the concrete posts at Upper Up playing 
    fields. Second was the installation of a proper footpath through the 
    allotments in Church Lane to Bow Wow.<br>
    On March 17th I attended a meeting of the SLCC Gloucestershire branch in 
    Nailsworth. A training session on the setting of agendas and taking minutes 
    was held which I found very interesting especially that a decision cannot be 
    made by a Council if the item under discussion was not promulgated 
    beforehand.<br>
    I was reliably informed by a South Cerney resident that Robert Hewer was 
    lodging at 1 Beverstone Road and I informed the Swindon County Court 
    accordingly.<br>
    On April 1st I attended a Local Transport Meeting at the Council Chamber in 
    Trinity Road. Besides Ged Cassell (CDC), Laura Oakley (GRCC) and Pat 
    Puddephatt, Rural Transport Partnership there were only four others present 
    including myself. Reference was made to the availability of a Community 
    Safety Grant which was available to provide youth shelters. During March I 
    logged 863/4 hours which over the 23 days available averaged 3hrs 46mins. 
    Although this is slightly in excess of my contracted hours it is acceptable.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    As Cllr Squire was unable to attend the Committee Meeting, Cllr Stuart 
    reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields 
    Committee that had met on 5 April.<br>
    <b>Ham Lane</b><br>
    No reply had yet been received from Sapco One Ltd regarding the access from 
    Sudeley Drive to Ham Lane. The Committee recommends that Sapco One Ltd be 
    given until the next meeting in May to reply and the Parish Council agreed.<br>
    <b>Silver Street/Robert Franklin Way Bridlepath (BSC1 [New])</b><br>
    The Clerk had contacted Phil Clueley PROW Officer at GCC regarding the 
    reinstatement of the half moon area and other areas to the left and right at 
    the Tin Bridge end of the bridlepath. Mr Clueley remarked that he had spoken 
    to Paula Postlethwaite (Ringways, Stroud) on 1st April and Mrs J. Roberts on 
    5th April both of whom were very satisfied with the condition of the 
    bridlepath. He continued that at the other end of the path, near the Robert 
    Franklin Way play area, the uneven surface should have been rolled level 
    yesterday. On BSC1 he will replace the stile at Northmoor Lane with a 
    kissing gate and where the canal crosses the Cirencester Road he intends to 
    build a flight of concrete steps and replace the stile there with a gate at 
    the top, on the east side to ease access. On Wildmoorway Lane (BSC20) he 
    intends to renew the pedestrian bridge over the river Churn with a new 9m 
    long galvanised bridge. Cllr Harris suggested that he also be asked to use 
    the scalpings stored nearby to reduce the muddy condition of the path from 
    the river Churn to Wildmoor Lock on the Spine Road.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Cycle Mounds</b><br>
    A temporary children's den erected on the cycle mound had been totally 
    vandalised. James Harris Contracting had been asked to remove and dispose of 
    the residue under the contingency payment arrangement. The Committee 
    discussed a request by young people using the cycle mounds that a bench seat 
    be installed in the area. The Committee recommends that a seat be 
    constructed from concrete blocks adjacent to the hedge which divides the 
    playing field from Berry's Farm.<br>
    <b>Noticeboard</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that he had delivered the covering pinboard to R. O. W. 
    Berry. Restoration work will start on the noticeboard on 10 April.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Planting</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest as a potential contractor and left the 
    meeting.<br>
    The Clerk reported that only two (2) tenders had been received from the six 
    (6) which had been sent out. On analysis, James Harris Contracting was the 
    more competitive. The Parish Council decided not to go ahead with the scheme 
    at this time.<br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting that the sub committee had with Laura 
    Oakley (GRCC) which discussed the best way forward to achieve a new plan for 
    the next five years or more. He continued: &quot;We were initially more than 
    concerned when Laura suggested that we should start by carrying out a 
    complete new Village Appraisal! None of us could accept this as being 
    necessary nor could we see that we would get sufficient support to do 
    another one. We agreed that we could use the 1999 Appraisal as the basis for 
    the new scheme but will carry out a 'survey' to ascertain what the Community 
    want in the village over the next few years. It was seen that there has been 
    only a few new dwellings built in Cerney over the past five years but of 
    course there has been other folk moving in and out of the village as always 
    happens.<br>
    It was seen that the greater majority of the 'wish list' set out in the 1999 
    Appraisal had been done or are being planned. This is excellent but we not 
    only require a new plan to continue this momentum, we must set up a system 
    to ensure that similar plans are made every five years or as and when 
    needed.<br>
    Our initial suggested scheme to obtain current views in Cerney includes:<br>
    1. Deliver a suitably worded 'Notice' to every dwelling in the parish via 
    the Cerney News. This will invite everyone to comment on the future of the 
    village. Correct wording will be critical but not yet drafted.<br>
    2. Contact all known clubs and organisations to obtain their collective 
    opinions<br>
    3. Hold an Open Weekend/ Pop In' at the Village Hall when views can be 
    given, schemes (past, present and future) discussed etc<br>
    4. Using preset forms, keep all responses etc<br>
    5. Collate information<br>
    6. Prepare analysis and use this to present the new Village Plan<br>
    It is essential that we involve every one possible in this project. If we do 
    not then it will have little or no authority and will not be accepted by 
    sources of funding for future schemes. That is the bottom line! If you don't 
    have a well-prepared Community Plan, you don't get any grants! Timing is 
    critical. We should get this moving now to aim to have the Open Weekend in 
    mid September at the very latest. If possible, July would be far better. To 
    get this moving in conjunction with The Village of the Year would be ideal.<br>
    The application for a grant to prepare this plan is in hand but it is not 
    guaranteed to succeed as the budget is almost used up and great preference 
    is given to applicants who are doing their first appraisal. Also, great 
    attention is made to applicants who are either Quality Councils or are in 
    the process of becoming so. Even without such a grant this is a worthwhile 
    project.&quot;<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way Play Area</b><br>
    Damage was being caused by children using the play area to neighbouring 
    fences. Cllr Harris estimated to plant a hedge 9m in length at the southern 
    side of the western entrance to the play area would cost £212 and £165 for a 
    7m run of hedge on the northern side of the same entrance. Cllr Caunce 
    proposed that the local community should be encouraged in selecting suitable 
    plants for such a hedge. Cllr Stuart suggested that a barrier to restrict 
    direct access be erected to deter the unsociable behaviour. Cllr Chubb, Cllr 
    Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart agreed to meet at the play area tomorrow 
    and decide what recommendations should be put forward to the Parish 
    Council..<br>
    <b>Chain Refund</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to a recommendation from the Committee that Cllr 
    Harris is reimbursed £7.50 for the damage caused to the chain he had 
    supplied to secure a piece of play equipment at Robert Franklin Way play 
    area.<br>
    <b>Cotswold Water Park</b><br>
    <b>Missing Rail on Bridleway Fence/Car Park/Bridge Parapet</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform the Cotswold Water Park Society to reinstate a 
    missing rail, on a barrier which prevented horses bolting from the bridleway 
    on to the play area, at Robert Franklin Way. Cllr Jay asked that the Society 
    be told again about the condition of the car park opposite Spring Lakes on 
    Station Road. Cllr Harris asked that the Society be requested to restore the 
    parapet to its original level on the bridge on BSC1 (New) near the Robert 
    Franklin Way play area.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that everything on the play area was clean and 
    tidy.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way Play Area</b><br>
    The Committee recommends that turf be applied to the fenced off area 
    excluding the Safagrass (rubber play surface). The Clerk was asked to obtain 
    quotes from suitable contractors to level and prepare the surface prior to 
    turfing. Also to grade a slope through the gateway to 1:12 maximum with &quot;as 
    raised gravel&quot; from the existing path to 1m beyond the line of the fence to 
    a thickness of 100mm. It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr 
    Jay that Adrian Gibbs be asked to turf and gravel the fenced off area for a 
    quoted price of £440 plus VAT. The Parish Council was all in favour. To 
    comply with the inspector's report A &amp; B Fencing should be asked to quote to 
    install a second gateway on the opposite side to the original gateway but 
    opening in both directions. A&amp;B Fencing quoted £285 for a gate with a double 
    spring in stainless steel and £185 for one with a painted spring. Cllr 
    Nicholas did not agree to the positioning of the second gate. Parish 
    Councillors would inspect the area tomorrow and bring their recommendations 
    to the next meeting of the Parish Council.<br>
    Macventure Play Co had been requested to lift the level of the area adjacent 
    to the right hand support leg of the 360° swing. The Committee recommends 
    that the Parish Council has agrees to a quotation from Macventure Play Co to 
    replace the middle carriage roof of the static train within the fenced off 
    area for £135 plus VAT. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr 
    Harris that the roof of the engine unit be repaired. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that parts of the Haggs Unit needed to be repainted. 
    Cllr Nicholas volunteered to repaint parts of the unit and it was agreed 
    that his expenses be reimbursed. The Clerk informed the Committee that this 
    unit has been donated by GPFA and Gordon Cornelius had been paid for its 
    storage and erection only. Mr Cornelius had agreed to comply with the safety 
    inspector's report and charge his petrol costs only as his fee. The Clerk 
    was to liaise with Natasha McKenna (CDC) to organise a presentation to 
    officially open the play area.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Up Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that there was no change to the condition of the Junior 
    &amp; Senior Swing, the Slide and Activity Area since the last inspection. 
    Someone had fitted a new net to the Basketball board. Adrian Gibbs, grass 
    cutting contractor, was concerned about the uneven surfaces on the reseeded 
    area and has asked that they be rolled. Cllr Harris was in agreement. Cllr 
    Jay volunteered to find out how much Travis Perkins would charge for the 
    hire of a roller. Cllr Stuart described recent vandalism to the hedge around 
    the tennis club where several branches had been broken off and damage to the 
    gutter on the front elevation of the cricket pavilion. The Clerk was asked 
    to liaise with the Community Support Officer to try and prevent this 
    activity. Cllr Stuart reported that he had been informed at a recent 
    conference on play areas that inspection reports should be kept for 21 years 
    and that Councillors carrying out the inspections should undergo an official 
    training course. The Clerk was asked to contact the GPFA and HSE to 
    ascertain if this information was correct. The Clerk had contacted RoSPA 
    regarding the availability and cost of a training course but at a minimum of 
    £770 for an on-site course or £160 for a day's course at Wantage the Parish 
    Council agreed to await the outcome of the Clerk's enquiries.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Play Area Safety Tiles</b><br>
    Matta Products quoted to replace the safety tiles with another type of 
    surface at a cost of £19,500. Sutcliffe Play quoted £15,477 to use a wet 
    pour rubberised compound in place of the tiles. Both prices subject to VAT 
    at current rate. The Clerk was asked to research if there was another type 
    of safety surfacing which might be used.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee that had met 
    on 5 April.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Cutts Charity</b><br>
    It was agreed that in future the donation made by the Parish Council through 
    refusing its contribution from the Cutts Charity be published in the 
    Minutes.<br>
    <b>Members' Allowances</b><br>
    It was agreed that a notice is published in a conspicuous place for 14 days 
    stating that the Parish Council has agreed to make available allowances of 
    £360 per elected Parish Councillor plus an additional £240 for the 
    Chairman..<br>

    W. A. Eaton Interim payment as agreed for Churchyard wall £2,000.00<br>
    James Harris Reimbursement for damage to chain £7.50 £21,228.80<br>
    The Committee recommends that £1,000 be withheld from the outstanding 
    payment to Macventure Play Co until the installation at Robert Franklin Way 
    has been satisfactorily completed.<br>
    Cllr Jay inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for March.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllrs Mrs Pollard that the 
    Parish Council agrees to make the above payments. Cllr Harris abstained. The 
    remainder of the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Clerk's Telephone Account</b><br>
    The Clerk had informed the Committee of an offer from BT which would reduce 
    the current year's internet charges by £10.19 but the payment method would 
    be by monthly direct debit. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by 
    Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council approves to reimburse the Clerk if he 
    personally sets up a monthly direct debit with BT for telephone and internet 
    charges. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Spreadsheet Analysis</b><br>
    The Administration total had exceeded its budget by nearly 17% which could 
    be attributed to the increase in the cost of employing the Clerk. Village 
    Maintenance had underspent its budget by nearly 8%. Generally the budget 
    showed an overspend of nearly 14%. The Committee agreed with Cllr Nicholas 
    who said it was important that accounts showed what had been spent totally 
    on each project so the reserve could be adjusted accordingly.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee that 
    had met on 5 April.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
