    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 13 MARCH 2002</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">Prior to the start of the Parish Council meeting Margaret Skivington,
    Thames Water Pumping Stations Catchment Manager gave a presentation on the state of the
    sewerage, drainage and pumping stations in the South Cerney area. She was accompanied by
    Liz Sale Community Liaison Executive for Thames Water who extended an invitation to Parish
    Councillors to visit the pumping station at Shorncote. Ms Skivington then reported that
    flow meters had been installed for 15 weeks in Broadway Lane and Berkeley Close and data
    from them was being analysed. For example the Broadway Lane meter had shown that average
    flows recorded were 1-2 litres per second while peak flows were 6-20 litres per second.
    Overall there was no correlation between rainfall and flows but the evidence proved that
    the water table in the area was below the sewerage levels. A CCTV survey of the 225mm pipe
    in Station Road to the pumping station showed that the pipe was 50% full. Cllr Nicholas
    asked why a flow meter had not been installed instead of a camera survey? Ms Skivington
    did not know the technical reason but surmised that flow meters were targeted primarily at
    the problem areas. CCTV showed up obstructions and infiltration problems but accepted that
    with a 50% usage it was difficult to assess problems in the pipe. A further survey would
    be carried out in drier weather. Cllr Nicholas then queried whether the main channels were
    large enough to cope. Ms Skivington replied that the sewers were in good condition
    although there was a problem with river and storm water infiltrating the system. Ground
    water levels are now the same as last winter's very high levels but the system was coping.
    On 30 October 2001 the pumping stations were thoroughly checked and found to working very
    well. They are constantly being monitored and operate when the level dictates. Ms
    Skivington took note of a request from Cllr Nicholas that a flow meter be installed in
    Station Road. Cllr Nicholas wanted to know the flow capacity of the 225mm pipe and how
    many dwellings were served by the pumping station in Robert Franklin Way. He was also
    concerned whether with the new developments planned, the pipe would be big enough to
    handle the effluent. Cllr Stuart considered that the size of the pumps would also be a
    factor. Cllr King asked what was the length of the CCTV survey in Station Road? Ms
    Skivington replied that it had been carried out from Drift Cottage to the pumping station.
    She added that the pumping station at Shorncote was due for a major upgrade costing £3.5
    million pounds to be completed in 2005 but operational in 2004. Liz Sale repeated the
    invitation she made at the outset to Parish Councillors to visit the pumping station at
    Shorncote where she would arrange for a technical team to be on site to explain its
    workings. Parish Councillors were generally favourable and a suitable time for a visit
    would be arranged. The Thames Water delegation left the meeting at 7.40 pm.<br>

    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 11
    March.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Appeal by Westbury Homes</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on a conversation he had with Paul Fong of Hunter Page Planning
    (HPP) regarding the Parish Council's response to the forthcoming Appeal by Westbury Homes.
    Mr Fong informed him that it was not out of the question that Westbury Homes would agree
    to the Conditions proposed by the Parish Council if the appeal was successful. Mr Fong
    suggested that a representative of the Parish Council might appear at the Appeal as a
    witness in support of Westbury Homes. It was generally agreed by the Parish Council that
    it was not appropriate for it to actively support Westbury Homes. Cllr Nicholas
    volunteered to make an objective statement of the Parish Council's position at the Appeal.
    Cllr Mrs Spriggs and Cllr Mrs Chubb were not in favour of this suggestion and argued that
    the letter sent to the Inspector would suffice and the Parish Council should now withdraw
    and no further contact made with HPP or Westbury Homes. Cllr Nicholas disagreed and would
    not be bound by this suggestion. Cllr King proposed that a prepared statement on behalf of
    the Parish Council's position be made at the Appeal. Cllr Harris supported Cllr King's
    proposal. Cllr Mrs Spriggs stated that as there was a deep division of opinion in the
    Parish Council and echoed in the village it was time to stand back and do nothing further.
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner disagreed with Cllr Mrs Spriggs and said that residents she had spoken
    to had congratulated the Parish Council on its decision. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the
    Parish Council that a new date for the Appeal had been arranged for 28 May and it was
    scheduled to last four days. The Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner decided to leave the
    decision on any action until next month¹s meeting. Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart agreed and
    added that hopefully there would be a larger turnout of Parish Councillors present and the
    differences could then be resolved.<br>

    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    In the absence of the Committee Chairman Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart reported on the
    deliberations of the the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on
    11 March.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising<br>
    CCTV Survey</strong><br>
    The Clerk had contacted Mrs Watkins at GCC Highways who informed him that Pat Mooney GCC
    Drainage Engineer would write to the Parish Council. The Clerk had emailed this
    information to Cllr Stuart who had then contacted Mr Mooney. Cllr Stuart reported that Mr
    Mooney had been very proactive in contacting all the various authorities and statutory
    undertakers which had services crossing the pipe. Mr Mooney had inspected the video and
    was concerned that the gas supply crossed the pipe but was unaware of the previous gas
    leak. Mr Mooney had asked those concerned for details and plans of all such services
    crossing the pipe. When these are received he will send a notice to all of the authorities
    insisting that all services offending/ compromising the pipe be removed and the pipe
    reinstated. When all such services etc have been removed, his department will arrange for
    the pipe to be scoured, a further CCTV inspection made and all necessary repairs to be
    carried out including extra inspection covers and reopening others that had been covered
    over.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village of the Year Prizes</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the Village Hall Committee would arrange for the supply of armed
    chairs to the Village Hall to the amount of the £250 prize money awarded to the Parish
    Council.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart had arranged to meet with Mr B. Greenaway GCC Street Lighting, Cllr Harris and
    Cllr Gardiner for an explanation of the work on the street lamps in Station Road. Cllr
    Stuart had informed him that the new lights were still not operative.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Stile on BSC17</strong><br>
    The Clerk had contacted the PROW office at GCC and a reply was awaited.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Golden Jubilee</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the proposed plans for the celebration at Upper Up playing field
    would clash with other activities in the village. The organising group would liaise with
    Mrs Rowena Merson to help with the gala to be held at Atkyns Manor. Cllr Dunn, Cllr
    Stuart, Capt Ian Cheeseman had arranged to meet with Mrs Merson on 20 March.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cycle Racks</strong><br>
    Rev Calvert had no objection to the cycle racks being placed in the churchyard. Marcus
    Kitchen, CDC Planning Officer had informed the Clerk that Planning Permission was not
    necessary for the Parish Council to erect the cycle racks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Moles</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner had reported that the moles were reappearing again on the playing fields at
    Upper Up. It was agreed to monitor the situation for the moment and the Clerk was asked to
    contact Able Pest Control to see if another solution could be found to eradicate the
    nuisance.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had carried out the inspections during the last period. At Robert Franklin Way
    play area he had cleared up broken bottles found at the bottom of the slide. At Upper Up
    he found that in wet weather the safety tiles were dangerous. The reinstatement of the
    tiles carried out by Wicksteed Leisure was ineffective. The Clerk had asked Drainmaster at
    Minety and Cllr Stuart had contacted Hydro Rod at Swindon to quote for pressure cleaning
    the tiles on all playing fields. It was decided not to repaint the basketball board at
    present as it will need to be replaced within the next two years. At Robert Franklin Way
    the play bark had been renewed. At Cerney Wick play area the post and rail fence had not
    been repaired. Cllr Harris counted eight upright posts which were rotting and six rails
    broken off. The hedge to the west needed to be pruned. At the Church Lane end of the play
    area the hedge there needed to be replaced. Cllr Harris was frustrated with the Cerney
    Wick Village Hall Committee in their lack of effort and it was agreed that he and Cllr
    Gardiner and Cllr Stuart should have a meeting with Mr Ian Fairbrother to resolve the
    situation. Cllr Gardiner will carry out the inspections in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK DEVELOPMENT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Martin Portus would submit the plans to the CDC today. Tenders
    for the work had been sent to four contractors. The Sub-Committee had met to discuss grant
    applications.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>WICKSTEED INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart stated that the Committee would report their comments on the Wicksteed
    Inspection at next month¹s Parish Council meeting.<br>

    <p align="left"><strong>QUALITY COUNCILS</strong><br>
    The Parish Council had been invited to have a direct say on the National Training Strategy
    and contribute ideas and views on a County Strategy. A meeting had been arranged for
    Saturday 16 March to be held at the Park Campus of the University of Gloucestershire in
    Cheltenham to which the Clerk and at least one Parish Councillor were expected to attend.
    No Parish Councillor was available but the Clerk volunteered to attend and report back to

    currently being developed by Raymond Fenton for the Parish Council. He asked Parish
    Councillors if there was any further topics which they thought should be included. Parish
    Council information already available included Minutes of previous meetings, Schedule of
    Meetings, Accounts, Parish Council contributions to Cerney News and much more. It was
    hoped to create a Chat Room to exchange comments but a facility already existed to email
    comments on the site. The Parish Council agreed that when the pilot site was ready it
    should be launched as soon as possible.<br>

    <strong>CUTTS CHARITY</strong><br>
    Mr Peter Jay and Dr Michael Bride whose terms of office expired at end of 2001 and April
    2002 respectively were willing to continue their association with the Cutts Charity. Cllr
    Mrs Gardiner proposed, seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish Council nominate Mr Jay and
    Dr Bride as Trustees of the Cutts Charity. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
