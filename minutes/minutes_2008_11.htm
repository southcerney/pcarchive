    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 12th November 2008</strong>.</p>

At 7pm Cllr Stuart welcomed Tiina Emsley, Principal Planning Policy Officer (CDC). Mrs
Emsley explained the background to the new system of Local Development Frameworks
(LDFs), and how they differ from local plans. Tiina clarified what has been achieved so far,
what CDC has consulted on and what’s coming next, as well as how South Cerney Parish
Council can get involved. For example what are their aspirations for the settlement’s future
and their vision of how the parish will evolve? A discussion followed on how the parish can
contribute towards the process and more especially the settlement profile. The need for the
provision of youth facilities should be emphasised as there are more young people in South
Cerney than in many other settlements in the District and the lack of resources was an
obvious drawback. Despite the large number of people living in South Cerney, the Parish
Council perceives that its service provision is not on the same level as in the District’s
settlements that have traditionally been regarded as market towns. More account must be
taken of the high level of employment provision in the industrial area of South Cerney which
is the second largest in the District. It was agreed that the Parish Council would discuss its
future aspirations for the settlement; how it would like to see South Cerney in 2026, and
formulate a vision, as well as contribute towards the settlement strategy. It was agreed that
the Parish Council will try to do this by the end of December 2008. Cllr Nicholas would like
to see the LDF become an adjunct of the Village Plan. Cllr Jay enquired when the LDF
would be adopted? Tiina replied that the aim was to submit the core strategy in 2010. The
LDF would have to comply with the spatial strategy which could possibly overrule some
village demands if a conflict arose. Cllr Nicholas agreed that the Parish Council should only
promote realistic demands. Tiina reiterated that the plan is designed to be flexible although
vital issues should be identified first. Cllr Caunce was assured that the concerns of Cerney
Wick would be included in the South Cerney response. Cllr Stuart ended the discussion at
7.30pm and thanked Tiina for her attendance. <br>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 8th OCTOBER 2008</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge that the minutes were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge apologised for his absence at the previous two 
 meetings but starting a new college term and other commitments had made it 
 impossible to fit in. However, in future if there was no one available to 
 attend he would arrange for a report to be given on the behalf of the YPC. Cllr 
 Stuart explained to Joe that it was not necessary for some one from the group 
 to attend every Parish Council meeting and it would be preferable if a 
 representative came when there was some matter to report. Joe reported that a 
 present the group was comprised of six members and coordination was proving 
 difficult. He hoped to recruit some new members from the youth group which 
 would meet on 24th November in the Village Hall. Cllr Stuart asked Joe to meet 
 with him before this meeting to discuss a possible strategy. Cllr Stuart 
 continued that the official opening of the MUGA would have to be delayed 
 primarily because the weather conditions were not conducive being too wet, too 
 cold and too muddy. It was, in his opinion, better to wait until April when 
 conditions would surely improve. Joe concurred. Cllr Harris asked Joe if his 
 group would consider what use would they suggest for the old basketball area of 
 the play area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING FROM PREVIOUS MINUTES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Enforcement Matters</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chapman complained that the advertisements were still on display on 
 the fence of Lake 11. Cllr Messenger (CDC) agreed to raise this with the 
 Enforcement Officer (CDC) and further outstanding matters were added by other 
 members of the Parish Council. 1. Two A-boards outside the entrance to the Four 
 Pillars Hotel, Spine Road advertising Christmas lunches; 2. Two A-boards 
 outside the Post Office in Clarks Hay, South Cerney obstructing the footpath; 
 3. Advertisements on Lake 10 (Waters Edge) and Lake 11 (Spring Lake) for which 
 no permission has been sought; 4. Occupancy of second homes in the Water Park 
 during “out of season”. Cllr Caunce was particularly interested in the 
 occupancy of a development in Cerney Wick. This is a dwelling on the eastern 
 (i.e. left hand side of the road) after the bridge over the disused railway 
 line from South Cerney to Cricklade which he suspects is occupied on a full 
 time basis; 5. The creation of a path/cycle way on the edge of Lake 10 (Waters 
 Edge) which is part of a planning condition not yet implemented; 6. Enforcement 
 of the planning condition to provide a cycle path to front of Four Pillars 
 Hotel which was awaiting the outcome of a GCC survey. Cllr Messenger (CDC) 
 asked the Clerk to email him the list which he would follow up on behalf of the 
 Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traffic Plan</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay confirmed that Peter Redfern had agreed to join the steering group and 
 David Hughes is also keen to become involved. Cllr Stuart had a meeting planned 
 with PC Jon Palfrey to discuss how the constabulary’s experience in such 
 matters might be of help. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SARA Meeting <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reminded Parish Councillors of the unscheduled SARA meeting 
 arranged for 14th November in the Village Hall and explained that neither he 
 nor Cllr Jay would be able to attend because of prior engagements. Cllr Caunce 
 and Cllr Mrs Land agreed to attend on behalf of the Parish Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 13th October I attended a meeting in the Village 
 Hall which had been called jointly by Mary Mychaleckyj (Gloucestershire Youth 
 Service) and Cllr M. Stuart. Fourteen people attended including Parish 
 Councillors Jay and Nicholas to discuss how to accommodate the social needs of 
 the village youth. Various options were discussed and divided into three 
 categories. In the short term the scout hut, cricket club pavilion and football 
 club were proposed; in the medium term the acquisition of a portakabin, 
 redundant class room or to lease accommodation; in the long term a purpose 
 built building was a hope. The meeting lasted about 75 minutes and the group 
 agreed to reconvene on Monday 3rd November at 5pm for a report on how the short 
 term goals were progressing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 16th I attended a meeting of the South 
 Gloucestershire Police and Community Consultative Group at the Colesbourne Inn. 
 I enquired as to the policy governing when a motorist would be prosecuted for 
 exceeding a speed limit. Inspector Williams explained that this was dependent 
 on road, weather and environmental factors but generally prosecutions were 
 imposed when vehicles exceeded the limit by 25%. The meeting which started at 
 7.30pm finished at 9pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 17th, Saturday 18th and Sunday 19th October I 
 attended the annual conference of the SLCC a report on which I will make 
 separately. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 20th October I accompanied Cllr Jay to a meeting with 
 Mr Stansfield where it was agreed that the Parish Council, at its expense and 
 under his supervision, will remove the hedging growth down river from the large 
 leylandii but not including it. Next to this leylandii are two hawthorns with a 
 gap between and beyond to two ash trees which will all be removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 3rd November I attended a follow up meeting of the 
 group concerned with providing youth facilities. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 10th November, along with most members of this Parish 
 Council I attended a meeting with two members of the Football Club, Clive and 
 Kevin Messenger, at the Village Hall. Cllr Stuart had a preliminary meeting 
 with other fund raising members on 22nd October at the Fishing Club where he 
 invited them to give members of the Parish Council a presentation of their 
 plans to restructure the dilapidated building which euphemistically serves as 
 changing rooms for players. Clive Messenger explained their plan with the help 
 of a slide show. Basically, the club estimates that it needs to raise £13,500 
 which, together with money already in hand of £18,500, will enable it to 
 rebuild new changing rooms on the footprint of the old building. Cllr Nicholas 
 and Cllr Jay explained the procedure which the Parish Council must adopt if it 
 decides to make the club a grant. If the club applied to other funders there 
 may well be a need for proof of security of tenure. The Parish Council already 
 has a lease with the Cricket Club which could be used as a template by the 
 Football Club. Cllr Mrs Land informed the representatives of other businesses 
 which might be able to help, for example banking groups. When Clive and Kevin 
 Messenger left the meeting Cllr Stuart asked the assembled Parish Councillors 
 if they were minded to support a grant to the club. There were no dissenters. 
 The matter would be further discussed by members at the Precept Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During October of the 18 available working days I averaged 
 4 hours per day which is 30 minutes per day more than my contract. I did not 
 include attending the conference in the calculations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SLCC Annual Conference Report <br>
 </b>I attended the Society of Local Council Clerks (SLCC) Annual Conference 
 from Friday 17th October to Sunday 19th October 2008. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As with last year’s Conference, I networked with quite a 
 few Clerks from Town and Parish Councils up and down the country. Their 
 feelings and thoughts, combined with what I learned from the various sessions 
 and workshops, have given me a good insight into the general understanding of 
 the Clerk’s profession. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">This year’s Conference theme was “Community Leadership: 
 Our Challenge”, which was mildly informative. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Keynote Address</b> <br>
 Jane Earl, Deputy Commissioner of the Electoral Commission explained the 
 complexities of the task of the Boundary Commission’s approach to new Unitary 
 Authorities, Community Empowerment and the creation of new parishes, especially 
 in London. Do not be in any doubt, unitary government is coming to all parts of 
 the UK, Gloucestershire included, eventually. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During the course of the Conference, I chose the following 
 sessions, each of which was of varying duration: </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Our Environment</b> <br>
 The speaker for this session was Mary Dhonau, Chief Executive of The National 
 Flood Forum. This organisation provides support to communities who have been or 
 are in danger of being flooded. The forum seeks to influence central and local 
 government agencies. Mary explained with graphic detail the alternatives 
 available to the humble and inefficient sandbag. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Green Initiatives</b> <br>
 The next session was on Green initiatives given by Terena Plowright who had set 
 up the Greening Campaign in response to global warming. She propounded several 
 ideas to encourage households to reduce their energy consumption in an effort 
 to lower their community carbon footprint – every little helps.  </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Legal Advice</b> <br>
 I 
 then had a one-to-one discussion with Alan Harrison, SLCC Legal Advisor on how 
 to proceed, following my experience with traders on the Upper Up car park. This 
 was a personal encounter and I do not wish to divulge its conclusion.  </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Panel 
 Discussion</b> <br>
 A panel discussion on “I want to make a difference, but I don’t like 
 politics” followed. The main speaker was John Redwood MP ably supported by an 
 American union leader Dyanne Reese, Francois Allers a South African government 
 official and Cllr Rob Stanton, Deputy Leader of Wokingham Borough Council. 
  
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Working for Smaller Councils</b> <br>
 This session explored the challenges of working 
 alone and the motivation required to succeed. I learned that as I work from 
 home and as the Parish Council does not supply an office I am entitled to claim 
 a tax allowance which I am happy to report the local tax office has acceded. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SLCC Report from Nick Randle, Chief Executive</b> <br>
 This was a bullish report on how the society was progressing and the future 
 challenges it faces. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Annual General Meeting</b> <br>
 The main concern was a heated debate on whether to accept a postal ballot on 
 resolutions. <br>
 This was soundly defeated by delegates. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Motivational Speaker – Lynn ‘the leap’ Davis CBE</b>
 <br>
 Olympic gold medallist from the 1964 Tokyo games and President of the UK 
 Athletics Members Council earned a two minute ovation for his presentation on 
 the final day of the conference under the title “It has been a long and 
 exciting journey from Tokyo to Beijing”. The Welsh medal winner at the 1964 
 games was the first British field event winner of a gold medal in 56 years and 
 thrilled and inspired a captivated audience with a motivational presentation 
 giving a breakdown of his work during 44 years involvement with the world of 
 athletics. He spoke of the ongoing work on the 2012 Olympics in London and of 
 his involvement with them saying that following the huge successes in the 
 Beijing games a target of 60 medals had been set for British competitors. As in 
 other years I found the experience very informative and return to general work 
 uplifted knowing that there is an organisation under whose umbrella I can rely 
 on for advice and leadership.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 10th NOVEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr Caunce had opened 
 the meeting at 6.55pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous</b> <br>
 Minutes Page 2463 – <b>Safety Surface at Upper Up</b>. Cllr Stuart confirmed 
 that the safety surface had been repaired and the sand delivered which had been 
 stored in the Cricket Club’s container. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2463 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards</b>. Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb reported that she had received only positive feed back to her enquiries 
 from local residents regarding the installation of a bus shelter at the 
 Lennards. Cllr Mrs Chubb informed the Parish Council that thirty eight 
 residents had so far responded. <br>
 Cllr Harris had declared a prejudicial interest as a competing contractor and 
 left the room while this item was discussed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2463 – <b>Mr Stansfield’s Hedge</b>. The Clerk 
 reported that he had accompanied Cllr Jay to a meeting with Mr Stansfield who 
 agreed to a proposal that a part of his hedge could be removed, under his 
 supervision, to afford a better view of the church from the Millennium Seat in 
 Bow Wow. Accordingly, from three replies to a quotation, it was ascertained 
 that James Harris Contracting was the only one available and it was decided to 
 recommend to the Finance Committee that it should be accepted. <br>
 Cllr Harris had returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2464 – <b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b>. The completion 
 of the work was unresolved. Cllr Caunce had again been in contact with Betec 
 who were aware of the situation. It was understood that payment for the work 
 would be withheld until the job had been passed as satisfactory. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2464 – <b>Bow Wow river bank</b>. It had been 
 observed that the dredging work to the river bed of the Churn through Bow Wow 
 currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency has caused damage to the 
 bulging wall which has partly fallen into the river and the edging of the 
 gabion baskets which were recently installed to support to the southern bank of 
 the river have been exposed. The Clerk was to ask Chris Franklin, 
 Gloucestershire Highways with a copy to Dave Ludford, Environment Agency, for 
 clarification and assurance that the exposed gabion baskets will be reinstated 
 and the wall rebuilt before the contract is completed. Mr Ludford had copied an 
 email to Chris Franklin to the Clerk which proposed a meeting to resolve the 
 problems. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2464 – <b>“Shorncote Link”</b>. Cllr Stuart reported 
 that Phil Cluley from Gloucestershire PROW had estimated the cost for the 
 proposed installation of a new bridge on the permitted route at Upper Up. The 
 cost of a 7 metre ABC metal bridge was approximately £2,000. The cost of 
 installation which would include site clearance of overgrowth and building 
 concrete abutments, and adding a 1.2m timber gate at each end would cost 
 £1,100. Altogether, including extras, a maximum of £3,500. It was agreed to 
 inform the Finance Committee that the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
 Committee is minded to accept this estimate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2464 – <b>Permissive Path from Kingfisher Place to 
 Huxley Court</b>. Cllr Stuart reported that he had been unable to contact the 
 Payback in the Community Team in order to negotiate a scheme for the 
 reinstatement of the path. Cllr Stuart will liaise with John-Charles Kimberley 
 and his group to determine if they might be willing to become involved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2472 – <b>Fallen Willow on Canal Tow Path</b>. Cllr 
 Stuart reported that Phil Cluley had cleared the obstruction. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2472 – <b>SARA Meeting.</b> Cllr Stuart had 
 encouraged Committee members to make every effort to attend the unscheduled 
 SARA meeting on Friday 14th November at 7.30pm in the Village Hall. As Cllr 
 Stuart and Cllr Jay would be unable to attend because of prior commitments it 
 was important that the Parish Council is well represented.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 As Cllr Walker had resigned and no replacement had been appointed to carry out 
 the weekly inspection of the play area, Cllr Harris had volunteered to make an 
 urgent checkup. Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge consented to share the 
 weekly inspection in future and Cllr Harris agreed to familiarise them with the 
 function. Cllr Harris had carried out an inspection and reported that there 
 were no problems in the Toddlers Play Area. New seats had been fitted to the 
 senior swings. Safety mats on the play areas needed cable ties.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that the repair to the safety surface at the Activity 
 Area had been completed and 26 bags of sand delivered and stored in the Cricket 
 Club’s container. The new drain at the end of the first section of the path 
 does not seem to be coping with the excess of surface water and extra work to 
 relieve the problem may have to be considered. The car park is becoming very 
 pitted again. Park Leisure had not responded to emails and telephone calls 
 regarding the completion of the MUGA installation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play area and equipment were all in good order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was agreed that Finance Committee considers the 
 following recommendations: that James Harris Contracting carries out the 
 removal of the hedge at The Downings; that payment is made to Mark Paget for 
 installing the dog bin in Church Lane and replacing the two seats on the swings 
 at Robert Franklin Way play area; that the Finance Committee is minded to agree 
 to the estimate for the erection of a footbridge on the “Shorncote Link”.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Changes recommended by Cllr Harris had been incorporated 
 into the revised grass cutting schedule quotation. Cllr Nicholas noted that the 
 item discussed on call out and hourly rate had not been included. The Clerk 
 would update the form. The cost of maintaining the churchyards in South Cerney 
 and Cerney Wick had been isolated as no decision had been taken on the Clerk’s 
 recommendation last month. GAPTC had advised the Parish Council to cease the 
 practice of tending the grass in both churchyards to avoid any potential 
 litigation which might arise through the actions of its contractors. If minded, 
 the Parish Council could make a grant to the church authorities to subsidise 
 any contractors it might select. The Clerk was asked to produce the advice for 
 consideration at next month’s Parish Council meeting and copy it to Mr Squire. 
 Cllr Webb stated that Mr Squire would like to attend the meeting. The Clerk 
 will inform Mr Squire.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that he had spoken with Mrs Ann Jones 
 at the Heritage and Design Tree Department of CDC on the revised procedure for 
 comments on tree work. He was satisfied with the new consultation arrangements. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reminded Committee members that Barry 
 Greenaway had reported that a decision to progress the part night operation of 
 street lighting had been taken in October. It was planned to complete the 
 conversions of units in South Cerney in conjunction with the annual routine 
 maintenance work programmed for January 2009. This is subject to a satisfactory 
 outcome from consultations with the police. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had noted that the two-way footpath sign at 
 the bridge to Box Bush at Lower Mill had been removed from its post. The Clerk 
 will report the incident to Gloucestershire PROW. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired if Cllr Stuart had anything to report 
 on the repair to the steps from Bow Wow to the old railway line. Neither Cllr 
 Stuart, Phil Cluley nor Mike Barton had been able to make contact with the 
 Payback in the Community team although efforts were continuing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had returned from a holiday to find 
 black plastic bags of rubbish flytipped in her gateway and an old settee chair 
 left in Northmoor Lane. Cllr Mrs Tunbridge will inform Mike Harris at CDC of 
 the incidents. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had attended a four hour 
 seminar on managing risk in the play provision entitled Places of Woe, Places 
 of Possibility at CDC offices on 7th November which had been run by Bernard 
 Spiegal of Playlink. One item of interest was the introduction of an Official 
 Play Policy which might be adopted by the Parish Council. Cllr Stuart had 
 enquired from Hester Hunt at GCC if a template was available. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the last extension of the 
 footpath behind the mounds at Upper Up was under water. Stuart Milsom was 
 liaising with the contractors to see what could be done to relieve the 
 situation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Flailing of hedges at Upper Up play area was added to the

 Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart had inspected the thatching and agreed that payment 
 should be made. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay stated that an analysis of the spread sheet showed that expenditure on 
 administration was in advance of budget but that of village maintenance was 
 below target. Generally the totals were in line with expectations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations of the Playing Field and Village 
 Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 The following recommendations had been made: that James Harris Contracting is 
 instructed to remove the hedge at The Downings for £85. At the Parish Council 
 it was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council 
 agrees to make this payment. The Parish Council was all in favour; that payment 
 is made to Mark Paget for installing the dog bin in Church Lane for £75 and 
 replacing the two seats on the swings at Robert Franklin Way play area for £20. 
 At the Parish Council it was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Webb 
 that the Parish Council agrees to make this payment. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour; that the Finance Committee is minded to agree to make a donation 
 towards the cost of the erection of a footbridge on the “Shorncote Link”. This 
 recommendation had been referred back to Cllr Stuart to negotiate with 
 Gloucestershire PROW for a smaller contribution to the project. Cllr Stuart 
 reported that after a discussion with Phil Cluley it had been agreed that the 
 Public Rights of Way would accept a contribution of £2,500 towards the cost of 
 the bridge and associated works. Cllr Jay praised Cllr Stuart on his 
 negotiating skills. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Land that the Parish Council will be minded to make the contribution when 
 requested. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 There were two copies of letters which had been sent to the CDC planning 
 department objecting to the application. <br>
 The Parish Council objects to this application because the proposed materials 
 are unsuitable in this conspicuous location. The site is on the boundary of an 
 attractive residential settlement, in a rural location, and so it should be 
 constructed using vernacular materials, not semi-industrial/ commercial 
 materials. If permission is to be granted, the Parish Council asks that the 
 following conditions be imposed: 1. The garage should be constructed of 
 materials that are appropriate to the locality and the existing buildings, to 
 protect and maintain the character and appearance of the area in which this 
 development is located. 2. The garage doors should be of vertical boarded 
 timber, which are more appropriate and in keeping with the appearance of the 
 area. 3. The garage should only be used for garaging and/or storage purposes 
 ancillary to the private residential occupation of the Crown Inn. <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council 
 objects to this application. The Parish Council was all in favour. <br>

 Proposal: Construction of 4 holiday lodges (revised scheme) <br>
 Conditions to note: 2. Notwithstanding Classes C2 and C3 of the Schedule of the 
 Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, or the equivalent to that 
 Class in any statutory instrument amending or replacing the 1987 Order or any 
 other change of use permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General 
 Permitted Development) Order 1995, the accommodation shall be used to provide 
 short term holiday accommodation only, which shall not be occupied as 
 permanent, unrestricted accommodation or as a primary place of residence. 
 Reason: The site is not suitable for permanent, unrestricted accommodation or 
 as a primary place of residence because of its rural location, in accordance 
 with Cotswold District Local Plan policies 19, 26 and UT.1, PPS1 and PPS7. <br>
 3. The holiday units to be erected as part of the development will not be 
 occupied from the sixth day of January until the fifth day of February 
 inclusive in each year. Reason: To control the occupancy of the holiday units 
 in an area where unrestricted residential accommodation would not normally be 
 permitted. This condition is imposed in the light of PPS1, PPS7 and PPG21 and 
 Policies 19, 26 and UT.1 of the Cotswold District Local Plan. <br>
 4. If at any time hereafter any holiday unit is let out by the developer or 
 sub-let by a leaseholder, the lease or sub-lease shall contain a covenant on 
 that part of the leaseholder or sub-leaseholder to comply with the covenants of 
 Conditions 2 and 11 above, the wording of such covenant having been previously 
 submitted to and approved in writing by the Council’s Solicitor such approval 
 not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at any time hereafter the 
 developer shall dispose of its freehold interest in the land or any holiday 
 unit is sold on a long lease (over 21 years) the developer will provide the 
 Council with the full name(s) and address(s) of the purchaser, lessee or person 
 to whom the freehold interest of the unit has been disposed to, within one 
 month of the date of the sale, lease or sub-lease. Reason: This is development 
 which is only permitted at this location because it provides holiday 
 accommodation. This needs to be carefully controlled. This condition is imposed 
 in light of PPG21. <br>
 5. From the date any holiday unit is first occupied the developer will at all 
 times hereafter:- (a) undertake an annual audit of all its lessees by the 
 thirteenth day of November in every year to ascertain that the units are being 
 occupied for holiday purposes and not a principal places of residence; or (b) 
 remedy the situation in the event that there are any detected breaches of the 
 occupancy restrictions; and (c) report all breaches immediately to the Council. 
 Reason: This is development which is only permitted at this location because it

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PERSONNEL COMMITTEE ON THE CLERK’S 
 ASSESSMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to leave the room while the report was 
 made by Cllr Jay. Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest as the Clerk 
 was a client of his firm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Personnel Committee met on 7th November. Having now 
 received the much overdue 2008/2009 National Salary Award for Local Council 
 Clerks, the Personnel Committee recommended that in recognition of the great 
 respect it has for the hard work and dedication given by the Clerk it 
 reiterates the decisions of the full Parish Council (May 2006 minutes p.2101) 
 and confirm that the current clerk’s salary should be in line with the 
 incremental structure set out in the above document. That is: Scale LC2 Range 
 (b) step 34 back dated to 1st April 2008 and Scale LC2 range (b) step 35 as 
 from 1st April 2009. The Casual Users car allowance of 58.7p per mile for the 
 first 8,500 miles. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Parish Council accepts the recommendations of the Personnel Committee. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas and the Clerk returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CONSULTATION ON CODES OF CONDUCT ETC</b>. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There is a 39 page consultation document with over 20 
 questions to answer on Communities in control: real people, real power; Codes 
 of conduct for local authority members and employees on circulation. The 
 Personnel Committee is of the opinion that either (a) a sub committee should be 
 formed to consider the document in detail or (b) that the Parish Council does 
 not respond. Cllr Nicholas stated that Parish Councillors should focus on the 
 parts of the document they individually felt strongly about. Cllr Jay will 
 email the contact web site address to all members and coordinate all responses.</p>
