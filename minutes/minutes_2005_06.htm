    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 8th June 2005</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart 
    welcomed Lt.Col. Iain McKend RLC. The Lt.Col. began by informing the 
    assembled Parish Councillors that he was last posted to South Cerney 15 
    years ago and noted how the place had changed especially the road system. 
    Through a Power Point presentation he explained the structure of 29 Regiment 
    and how it fitted together to form a cohesive unit of 400 personnel although 
    two units were presently accommodated off base at Aldershot and Abingdon. So 
    far this year the base had handled 11,557 transit people and a total of 
    about 22,000 were expected by year’s end. He was optimistic that improved 
    catering and accommodation facilities would be installed in the near future. 
    He was pleased to be a Governor at Ann Edwards School. He explained the 
    Silver Stars activities and how complaints and concerns about its activities 
    by the local population were addressed. Cllr Stuart thanked Lt.Col. McKend 
    for his attendance and informative presentation and he left the meeting at 
    7.30pm.</p>

    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.35pm.<p>
    Cllr Jay had made an apology for his absence due to a holiday commitment. 
    Cllr Mrs Pollard had apologised for her absence due to illness. Cllr Bennett 
    and Cllr Mrs Clark (both CDC) had made their apologies. Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) 
    had also made an apology.</p>
    <p>Cllr Stuart welcomed Ms Jenni Silver, reporter on the Wilts and Glos 
    Standard, to the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 11th MAY 2005</b><br>
    Page 1966: Last paragraph – Cllr Nicholas remarked that it was not clear 
    which road was being referred to in the text. It was agreed that the 
    following be added after “weekly.” third line from the bottom. ... “weekly 
    when the Spine Road and its arteries were affected.”<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Youth Service</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Webb that the officer 
    replacing Bernie Cox of the Youth Service be invited to attend either the 
    August or September meeting and present proposals on how the service could 
    benefit the youth of South Cerney. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Community Charge Grant</b><br>
    Cllr Webb was concerned that Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the Parish 
    Meeting on 18 May 2005 that because the Parish Council had not applied to 
    the fund created by the increase in community charges to owners of second 
    homes in the district, no grant had been forthcoming. Cllr Webb said that 
    her statement was misleading. In reply to a question recorded in the Minutes 
    of 10 Nov 2004 page 1903, from Cllr Jay to Cllr Baines (CDC) about how South 
    Cerney Parish might benefit from the increase, Cllr Baines agreed to enquire 
    from CDC how the extra council tax collected on holiday homes would impact 
    on the precept and how many properties in the Parish contribute to the 
    council tax. The reply from Cllr Baines (CDC) is recorded in the Minutes for 
    the 8 Dec 2004 page 1910 under Matters Arising. He explained that second 
    homes in the area had no effect on the precept. The extra income produced 
    through the reduction in discount from 50% to 10% would be for the benefit 
    of the District Council, County Council and the Police. Cllr Webb declared 
    that because of this information no application by the Parish Council had 
    been considered and it was therefore disingenuous of Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) to 
    infer that the Parish Council had been negligent.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising from Annual Parish Meeting</b><br>
    The Chairman ordered that Matters Arising from the Annual Parish Meeting 
    should be made an agenda item for the Parish Council meeting scheduled to be 
    held in July.<br>
    <b>Flood Forum</b><br>
    As neither Cllr Bennett (CDC) nor Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would be attending 
    the next meeting of the Flood Forum to be held on Friday 17th June the Clerk 
    was asked to request Cllr Baines to act as representative for South Cerney. 
    Parish Council members voiced their dismay and disappointment that both 
    representatives would be unable to attend. Arrangements had been made for 
    Cllr Nicholas to attend and Cllr Bennett (CDC) had informed the Clerk that 
    permission for Cllr Nicholas to speak on behalf of South Cerney would be 
    sought.<br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs and Pedestrian Crossing</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to enquire from John Whittaker GCC Highways if any 
    progress had been made towards completing these projects.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Wednesday 18th May I attended the Annual Parish Meeting in the Village 
    Hall. There was a full turnout of Parish Councillors, District Councillors 
    and the County Councillor supplemented by 29 members of the public. On 
    Thursday 19th May I attended the RIAT (Royal International Air Tattoo) 
    briefing at RAF Fairford. Significant changes to the organisation were 
    explained. For example the new Trust and Company had no longer a direct link 
    with the RAF Benevolent Fund. The RAF Charitable Trust now owns the company 
    RAF Charitable Trust Enterprises and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Knight is 
    the new Chairman of the Trustees. Building for the event will start on 
    Monday 20th June and on 13th July the first participating aircraft will 
    arrive. On Thursday 14th July the park and view area will open. On 15th July 
    the traders’ showground will be open from 12 noon until 4 pm. Later that 
    evening around 10 pm early bird public car parks will open for business. On 
    the event days 16th and 17th the showground will open to the public from 
    7.30 am until 9.30 pm. The flying display will take place from 10 am until 6 
    pm followed by an evening concert. The site will be dismantled on Monday 
    19th July. Admission this year remains £35 per adult or £29.95 in advance 
    and children under 16 will be admitted free if accompanied by an adult. One 
    notable request was made by a District Councillor who informed the 
    organisers that a contribution from them would be appreciated in view of the 
    200 extra officer hours needed during the event. The organisers were 
    extremely grateful for the help given to it by the community. The community 
    help line is 01285 713000. On Sunday 22nd May I met with Cllr Smith who 
    kindly showed me how to archive emails. On Tuesday 24th I accompanied Cllr 
    Stuart to the official opening of the Cotswold Water Park’s new visitors’ 
    facility at Keynes Park. In the evening Cllr Smith and I met with Mrs 
    Gardiner who explained how the Parish Council’s accounts balanced. During 
    May I averaged 4 hours 15 minutes per available working day. Again somewhat 
    higher than my contract allows but accounted for by the extra meetings 
    attended during the month.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village 
    Maintenance Committee which had met on 6th June.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Election of Officers</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb had proposed and Cllr Caunce seconded a motion that Cllr 
    Squire, if he agreed, continued as Chairman of the Playing Fields and 
    Village Maintenance Committee. Cllr Squire had no objection and was duly 
    unanimously elected as Chairman.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb had proposed and Cllr Caunce seconded a motion that Cllr 
    Stuart, if he agreed, continued as Vice Chairman of the Playing Fields and 
    Village Maintenance Committee. Cllr Stuart had no objection and was duly 
    unanimously elected as Vice Chairman.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Safety Surface Feedback</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that the four replies he had from Fenplay customers were 
    positive. The most critical pronounced that “you get what you pay for” 
    whilst the most positive was enthusiastic about the performance of the 
    surface and suggested that its site be inspected to see what a good result 
    the surface provided. After some lengthy discussion the Parish Council was 
    minded to make emergency repairs only to the tower slide at Robert Franklin 
    Way and to remove it and its safety surface during the autumn, reinstating 
    the resulting hole with grass.<br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a potential supplier and left 
    the meeting.<br>
    Cllr Squire calculated that, excluding Robert Franklin Way play area, it 
    would cost approximately £11,395, based on previous quotations plus 5%, to 
    replace the rubber safety tiles at the other two play areas with Fenplay. 
    Although James Harris Contracting had quoted to remove and dispose of the 
    tiles for £875, Ali Swainston, Head Ranger at Keynes Country Park had 
    informed the Chairman and Clerk at a recent meeting that he would be 
    prepared to do the work free of charge in exchange for the tiles. The Clerk 
    was asked to get confirmation of this deal in writing. In the meantime the 
    Clerk was to enquire from G. E. Taylor of The Play Service how much it would 
    cost to supply and install Fenplay Softfall at Upper Up and Cerney Wick. If 
    a contract is agreed to by the Parish Council at its next meeting in July 
    when precisely would the work start? Tenders for the removal and disposal of 
    the tiles at Upper Up and Cerney Wick should be sought for and their removal 
    coordinated with the installation of the new material. Cllr Stuart 
    volunteered to ask the Probation Service if it was prepared to raise the 
    tiles. Other suppliers should also be contacted to requote for the uplifting 
    and disposal of the tiles.<br>
    Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <b>Barrier on old railway track </b><br>
    Tim Pain, Chief Executive of the Cotswold Water Park had written to confirm 
    that its Estates Department would shortly repair the chicane on the old 
    railway track.<br>
    <b>Rural Road Sweeping</b><br>
    The Clerk had forwarded a complaint from Cllr Mrs Chapman to Cllr Bennett 
    (CDC) about the muddy state of Cerney Wick Lane between the entrance to Lake 
    11 and the Spine Road. Cllr Bennett (CDC) had contacted the owner/manager of 
    Lake 11 who agreed to erect a sign at the nearby cross roads to inform 
    complainants of his telephone number to which incidents could be reported. 
    On behalf of the Committee, Cllr Squire would like to thank Cllr Bennett 
    (CDC) for his good work.<br>
    <b>Pathway South Cerney/Siddington/Cirencester</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on an evening meeting he had with Cllr Nicholas and 
    members of the Canal Trust. The party walked the canal route towards 
    Siddington from The Lock House on Cirencester Road to the bridge over the 
    river Churn. The Canal Trust would support the Parish Council in its 
    endeavours to persuade GCC PROW to create a path from South Cerney to 
    Siddington. When Cllr Stuart met with Tim Pain (Cotswold Water Park) he 
    informed him that he would give the Parish Council “one hundred and fifty 
    percent support” for such a project.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Humps</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Harris who had voluntarily operated the mini digger 
    at Upper Up to excavate the humps and bumps. The Committee agreed to a 
    suggestion from Cllr Caunce that the Clerk write and thank Ermin Plant Hire 
    for its generous loan of the equipment.<br>
    <b>Steps from Bow Wow to old railway line</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had with Mr Mould and Mike Barton (GCC 
    PROW) regarding the ownership and responsibility for the maintenance of the 
    steps from Bow Wow to the old railway line. Mr Barton proposed to create a 
    “permissive footpath” over the steps and if successful GCC PROW would become 
    responsible for their maintenance.<br>
    <b>Extending the Upper Up path to Keynes Park</b><br>
    The extension of the pathway from Upper Up through the reed beds to Keynes 
    Park was also discussed and Cllr Stuart was hopeful of a successful outcome 
    eventually.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Vandalism</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform the PCSO of recent vandalism which had 
    occurred to the cricket pavilion at Upper Up and the continuing drinking 
    taking place on the playing fields, evidence of which was the discarded cans 
    and bottles being found there.<br>
    <b>BSC1 and BSC20</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that Tim Pain (Cotswold Water Park) had informed him 
    that the Environment Agency was about to dredge the drainage ditch alongside 
    the SSSI after which GCC PROW would carry out major work on the footpaths.<br>
    <b>Lakeside Car Park</b><br>
    Mr Tim Pain (Cotswold Water Park) informed Cllr Stuart that the Lakeside car 
    park would undergo extensive redevelopment early next winter. In response to 
    a request from Tim Pain, Cllr Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart 
    volunteered to attend a meeting to discuss the plan.<br>
    <b>Other Car Parks</b><br>
    Mr Pain (Cotswold Water Park) was aware of the problems incurred through car 
    parks being secured and he was working on a scheme at the Gateway car park 
    which he described as “lock up later” that might alleviate the inconvenience 
    although the security of the area was of prime importance. Mr Pain was happy 
    to report that the car park at the Arches on the Spine Road would remain 
    permanently open and recent unsocial behaviour had stopped since the 
    undergrowth surrounding the parking area had been cleared back.<br>
    <b>Road Scalpings</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Clerk 
    enquires from Cllr Parsons (GCC) why GCC Highways charge its Public Rights 
    of Way maintenance section for supplying road scalpings whereas neighbouring 
    Wiltshire County Council gives them free to its PROW team.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris was concerned about the movement of the footings in the 360 
    degree swing when in use. The Clerk had enquired from the John Hicks, Safety 
    Inspector if these had been checked during use when the yearly inspection 
    had been carried out. John Hicks confirmed that he had rigorously tested the 
    equipment and found nothing untoward. He advised that a long screw driver be 
    inserted alongside the concrete plug to see if the wooden support had 
    deteriorated. The problem may well be that the ground is drying out and when 
    it becomes wet again the problem will cease. The Clerk had also contacted 
    Macventure Play Co which supplied and installed the equipment. Chris Jones 
    who now works for the installers will advise Steve Griffiths who will 
    inspect the equipment at his earliest convenience although he is in north 
    Wales working on a large project at the moment. Cllr Harris also reported 
    that one of the wooden safety spindles on the tower slide was missing. The 
    Clerk had asked Ian Fairbrother if he could make an urgent repair. Trees 
    alongside the river Churn bridge parapet had been cleared on Saturday 4th 
    June.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order. Rabbits were becoming a nuisance in the grassy part of the play area.<br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that Adrian Gibbs had sprayed all the edges of the play 
    surface and the car park. The Clerk was asked to check with Mr Gibbs to 
    ascertain if the pathway to the other end of the play area had also been 
    treated. The Cricket Club store bin had been moved and was now almost out of 
    sight.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that entrance fees at Keynes Park would be based on per 
    person visiting instead of per car.<br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report the continuing appearance of 
    advertising signs at the end of Station Road near its junction with the 
    Spine Road to the Enforcement Officer (M. Grace) at CDC. He also asked that 
    Cotswold Water Park be informed that an advertisement had been affixed to 
    its fence at the Lakeside car park.<br>
    Cllr Squire reported that some of the older headstones in the churchyard 
    would need to be straightened up. He confirmed that the ecclesiastical 
    insurers would reimburse the cost of realigning headstones.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that the hedge next to Drift Cottage in Station Road 
    was overgrowing the pavement and the occupiers of the cottage should be 
    asked to cut it back.<br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Committee that judging by a panel from the Village 
    of the Year competition would take place at 3pm on 23rd June. Later that 
    evening at 7pm the Open Evening would be held which was designed to 
    encourage participation in the Village Plan. He encouraged all members of 
    the Parish Council to attend both events.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which 
    had met on 6th June.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Election of Officers</b><br>
    Cllr Jay and Cllr Smith had informed the Clerk that both were prepared to 
    stand again as Vice Chairman and Chairman respectively if there were no 
    other nominations.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Webb that Cllr Smith, 
    in his absence, remains as Chairman of the Finance Committee. The Committee 
    was all in favour.<br>

    his absence, remains as Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee. The 
    Committee was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Community Internet</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that Raymond Fenton would provide a computer and 
    connect it to Broadband at reasonable cost. The United Church would be 
    willing to let people use its facilities.<br>
    <b>Personnel Committee</b><br>
    Cllr Webb informed the Committee that the Personnel Committee had 
    unanimously agreed new terms and conditions which would be offered to the 
    Clerk. Approval would be sought at the next meeting of the Parish Council.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Grass Cutting</b><br>
    Grass cutting cuts for this current year and those of last year. Please note 
    that the VAT element is inconsistent as some contractors are registered and 
    others are not.</p>

    <b>Councillor’s Reports</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart displayed a simulated picture of a proposed construction which 
    adequately demonstrated shape, size, material type and colour. The Parish 
    Council agreed with his request that the CDC be requested that clients 
    supply CAD (computer aided design) pictures of proposed buildings when 
    making an application.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Correspondence</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas completed a questionnaire pertaining to the new Statement of 
    Community Involvement which the Clerk would return to CDC. His 
    recommendations included that Village Plans and Appraisals should be taken 
    into account and specific details as to colour and materials to be used 
    should be notified. CAD pictures of a finished structure would also help. 
    Difficult to reach groups, for example teenagers to 25 year olds should also 
    be included in the consultation. Interestingly the LDP (Local Development 
    Plan) may amend regulations in force through the Local Plan.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ PORTFOLIO REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Webb on behalf of the Village Hall Committee thanked the Parish Council 
    for its generous contribution which helps subsidise Village Hall 
    expenditure.<br>
    Cllr Smith volunteered to create accounts of expenditure to help with the 
    control of Committees outgoings.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PERSONNEL COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    The Clerk left the room while the Parish Council discussed the report of the 
    Personnel Committee.<br>
    Cllr Webb read the following: The Personnel Committee comprising Cllr Jay, 
    Cllr Mrs Pollard, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb held a meeting on Wednesday 26th 
    May 2005. The reason for the meeting was to discuss the new pay structure 
    and contract of employment for the Clerk of the South Cerney Council using 
    the following publication covering the salaries and condition of service of 
    full-time and part-time clerks and other officers of Town and Parish 
    Councils (referred to as Local Councils). This includes: Guide to good 
    employment practice in local councils; Model contract of employment and job 
    description; New pay structure.<br>
    After a lengthy discussion on all of the three subjects were reached an 
    unanimous agreement to adopt them in total. This means the new pay structure 
    of the Clerk will start on scale LC2 Range ‘b’ Step 31 back-dated to 1st 
    April 2005. We also agreed to provide the Clerk with all the necessary 
    equipment to carry out his duties.<br>
    We recommend this to the Parish Council.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    The Clerk rejoined the meeting and both he and the Chairman, Cllr Stuart 
    signed the new agreement.<br>
