    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour. Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked when the opening ceremony would take place. Cllr Stuart 
    replied that minor work was needed to complete the project and when done 
    Natasha McKenna and Mrs Shirley Alexander would be invited to attend. Turf 
    would be laid in the fenced off part on Monday 17 May and the ramp would be 
    altered to make the slope more accessible. Another gateway to this area was 
    also needed with a suitable apron to the main playing area. The Clerk was 
    asked to obtain quotes to remove and dispose of the old concrete seat and 
    make good the ground.<br>
    <b>CT.8163/J</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) explained that the Parish Council would not necessarily 
    be informed of tree work at Orchard House by CDC. Cllr Nicholas queried what 
    checks were in place to prevent this type of &quot;back door&quot; consent and he 
    could not understand why tree work is dealt with outside the planning 
    procedure. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) suggested that the question should be 
    addressed to M. Kitchen (CDC Planning).<br>
    <b>Spine Road Cycle Path</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) explained that the cycle path will indeed be joined up 
    where the link is missing at the northern end of the Spine Road.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Mr &amp; Mrs Collis were in attendance.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee that 
    had met on 10 May.<br>
    Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0144/4/T</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr J. Hartsherne, 37 Oak Way, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. 
    GL7 5XX<br>
    Erection of single storey boot room extension at site adjacent to Hailwood, 
    Station Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Mr &amp; Mrs Collis made their objections to this application known to the 
    Parish Council emphasising that the extension was in direct contravention of 
    the Decision Notice. They were also concerned about a future application to 
    which Cllr Nicholas stated that the Parish Council can only deal with the 
    current application.<br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) joined the meeting at 8.15pm<br>
    Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Mrs Chubb seconded a motion that the Parish 
    Council objects to the application because the footprint is already big 
    enough and further development will impinge on the neighbouring property on 
    the western side. The site is also over developed. Six Parish Councillors 
    voted in favour, 3 against and there were 2 abstentions. The proposal to 
    object was therefore carried.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>04/00958/NEI</b><br>
    Applicant: A. K. Bowley, Church Farm, Ashton Keynes, Wilts SN6 6QR<br>

    wildlife care centre and temporary buildings by North Wiltshire District 
    Council (R)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/W</b><br>
    Applicant: Pakeman Catto and Carter, The Mallards, Broadway Lane, South 
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Alterations to existing office space and two-storey extension of existing 
    building at The Mallards, Broadway Lane, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0645/Z</b><br>
    Applicant: J. Shipman Contracting Ltd, 42 Elliot Road, Love Lane Industrial 
    Estate, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    New light industrial unit, parking, turning and drainage at Plot G, 
    Evergreen Industrial Estate, Broadway Lane, South Cerney, Cirencester, 
    Glos..<br>
    If permission granted the Committee recommends that the following condition 
    be inserted: Any external lights should be of a design to achieve optimal 
    reduction of light pollution.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.3925/N</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr E. Luker, The Horse &amp; Groom, Cricklade Road, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Amended Plans: Conversion of existing hotel and public house to form 5 
    (five) dwellings at Horse and Groom, Cricklade Road, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Gloucestershire<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that if this application was granted it would set 
    a precedent for further large scale residential development in rural 
    settings in complete contravention of sustainability policies. The site 
    would be unsuitable for residential development because of the excessive 
    noise from the adjacent dual carriageway.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.4498/W</b><br>
    Applicant: Four Pillars Hotels Ltd<br>
    Amended Plans: Hotel, leisure club, restaurant and staff accommodation at 
    Lake 6, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Before any decision could be taken the Committee requests answers to the 
    following questions:<br>
    1. What is the type and source of the natural stone to be used?<br>
    2. What is the type and colour of the reconstituted or natural roof tiles?<br>
    3. What is the type, colour and finish of the cladding material?<br>
    If permission is granted the Committee recommends that all power lines will 
    be underground. Any external lights should be of a design to achieve optimal 
    reduction of light pollution. Provision should be made for cycle racks. All 
    signage to be kept to a minimum and subject to separate detailed planning 
    approval. Section 106 contributions to include an all weather enclosed play 
    area in South Cerney, substantial contribution to play areas in both Cerney 
    Wick and South Cerney, a contribution to upgrade the Sustrans Route 45 and a 
    contribution to the Building and Monument Fund of South Cerney Parish 
    Council. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) explained that a Section 106 agreement worth 
    £100,000 to be used by the Cotswold Water Park had been agreed with the 
    developers. Cllr Nicholas suggested that funds should be available to 
    provide a meaningful alternative form of sustainable transport. Cllr Caunce 
    remarked that part of the Section 106 funds should be specifically earmarked 
    for Cerney Wick and South Cerney.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed with the Committee's recommendation that it 
    objects to the development until further details are provided but that it 
    has no objection in principle to this design of development. The Clerk was 
    asked to invite Mr Murtagh (a director of Four Pillars Hotels Ltd) to the 
    next meeting of the Planning Committee on Monday June 7.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the 
    Parish Council accepts the recommendations of the Planning Committee 
    regarding the other applications with the exception of CT.0144/4/C which had 
    already been determined and to ratify the decision on 04/00958/NEI. The 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning Permission granted by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0329/D</b><br>
    Certificate of Lawful Use or Development: Use of two (2) staff buildings as 
    private dwellings at Hales Farm, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1454/4/A</b><br>
    Retention and change of use of mobile home to temporary agricultural 
    dwelling and development of ancillary structures at Wildmoor Waters, 
    Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Condition of note is: By 8th April, 2007 the permitted mobile home and 
    clubhouse shall be removed from the site and the land re-instated to its 
    former condition. Reason: Permanent development of this type might not be 
    justified at this location in open countryside. Temporary permission is 
    granted to enable the Local Planning Authority to give further consideration 
    to the development after the temporary period has expired. This condition is 
    attached in light of guidance at Annex I of PPG7.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1470/1/B</b><br>
    Change of use from leisure club building to holiday lodge accommodation at 
    Health &amp; Leisure Club, Watermark Club, Station Road, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Condition of note is: Notwithstanding Classes C2 and C3 of the Schedule of 
    the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, the accommodation 
    shall be used to provide holiday accommodation only, which shall not be 
    occupied as permanent, unrestricted accommodation or as a primary place of 
    residence. Reason: The site is not suitable for permanent, unrestricted 
    accommodation or as a primary place of residence because of its location 
    within open countryside. This condition is imposed in the light of PPG21 and 
    Policy 37 of the Cotswold District Local Plan.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.3887/2/Y</b><br>
    Erection of rear conservatory at 19 The Lennards, South Cerney, Cirencester, 
    Glos.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.3887/3/A</b><br>
    Erection of rear conservatory at 6 The Lennards, South Cerney, Cirencester, 
    Glos.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.4313/Z</b><br>
    Listed Building Consent: Alterations to rear kitchen, formation of a flat 
    roof element with parapet wall and the installation of two new dormer 
    windows at Ivy Cottage, Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.4313/1/A</b><br>
    Alterations to rear kitchen, formation of a flat roof element with parapet 
    wall and the installation of two new dormer windows at Ivy Cottage, Cerney 
    Wick, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.8163/J</b><br>
    Revised design of new house at land at Orchard House, Upper Up, South 
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Conditions to note are: Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and 
    Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, or any other 
    statutory instrument amending or replacing it, no openings, extension, 
    structure, building, hardstanding, fence, wall or other means of enclosure 
    shall be erected, constructed or inserted in the building or on the site 
    other than those permitted by this Decision Notice. Reason: The building has 
    a distinct and attractive character and appearance which should be 
    maintained. In order to protect these qualities, it is essential for the 
    Local Planning Authority to maintain control over the types of development 
    listed above, in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 29 
    and 40, and PPG15. Before the development is occupied or brought into use 
    the boundary treatment of the site shall be agreed in writing with the Local 
    Planning Authority and shall be permanently maintained thereafter in 
    accordance with the approved details. Reason: The boundary features will be 
    important in screening the site and helping the development to blend in with 
    its surroundings. This condition is imposed in accordance with Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policies 42 and 43. Within 3 (three) months of the date 
    of this permission the existing rendered wall immediately to the south of 
    the Scots Pine tree at the site shall be permanently faced in natural stone 
    in accordance with details first agreed in writing with the Local Planning 
    Authority. Reason: To ensure the details of the wall are satisfactory, in 
    accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 29. For the avoidance of 
    doubt, the wall is coloured yellow on the approved plan.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas pointed out that there was no Conditions for landscaping. Cllr 
    Mrs Clark (CDC) will enquire from the Planning Department at CDC and inform 
    the Parish Council of its decision.<br>

    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and 
    Playing Fields Committee that had met on 10 May.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Ham Lane</b><br>
    No reply had yet been received from Sapco One Ltd regarding the access from 
    Sudeley Drive to Ham Lane. The Parish Council agrees with the recommendation 
    of the Committee that Sapco One Ltd be given further time to reply. Cllr 
    Stuart suggested that if no reply was forthcoming by the June meeting Sapco 
    One Ltd should be informed of the Parish Council's intention to create a 
    concrete ramp through the hedge from Sudeley Drive to Ham Lane.<br>
    <b>Footpath Work</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had informed the Committee that he had arranged to meet Phil 
    Clueley (GCC PROW), Allan Thomson (Community Service) and a representative 
    from CROWS at 12 noon on Monday 17 May to discuss the upgrading to the 
    footpath across the Downings. Cllr Squire would also attend the meeting. 
    Cllr Harris asked that Mr Clueley be informed that the footpath along the 
    tow path of the old canal between Northmoor Lane and Bow Wow was being used 
    as a bridleway and suggested that gates or another obstruction be erected to 
    prevent this abuse.<br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that he had arranged a meeting at the Westwoods Centre, 
    Northleach on Saturday 15 May with Laura Oakley (GRCC) to further discuss 
    the village plan.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that A &amp; B Fencing Ltd quoted £393 for the obstruction 
    fence between the senior play area and entrance to the play area and £20 to 
    replace the damaged fence (both quotes ex VAT). Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr 
    Webb seconded a motion to approve the expense. With the exception of Cllr 
    Nicholas who objected the rest of the Parish Council was in favour and the 
    motion was carried.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way Play Area</b><br>
    The roof of the train engine section has been replaced but one wheel has 
    been lost off the engine. The Clerk was to ask Macventure Play to quote to 
    supply and fit: (a) 2 (two) new wheels to the train engine; (b) remove 
    middle pair of wheels from the carriage and use 1 (one) on the engine. Save 
    the other as a spare and (c) secure all wheels with extra screws. The latch 
    was broken on the gate of the Toddlers Play Area. The seat had not yet been 
    moved. Cllr Harris had rebolted the base plate on 30 April but the plate had 
    worked free and different tags were needed. The Committee decided to put the 
    swing out of action because it is now considered a safety hazard and 
    requires modification before children can be allowed to use it. The Clerk 
    was to ask Macventure Play to remove the tyre and its chain work up to the 
    universal joint to prevent its use. Cllr Harris reported that there was a 
    trip hazard at the edge of the Safa safety surface which needs a cable tie. 
    The surface was now clogged up with mud and will become useless. Macventure 
    is aware of the problem and is researching a solution. The tower slide is in 
    need of repainting as grafitti is starting to appear on it. Cllr Nicholas 
    volunteered to paint the unit and his offer was gratefully accepted by the 
    Parish Council. The Hags unit had been painted. A late night incident (11pm) 
    on Saturday 8 May was reported to the Police who logged the call but were 
    unable to attend. Cllr Stuart suggested that the tower slide which was 
    little used might be moved to a site where it would be of more use.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Up Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that although there was no structural problems on the 
    slide this item is rarely if ever used as it is virtually inaccessible to 
    children who are of an age group who wish to use it. The cycle mounds are 
    well used but drainage must be carried out as soon as possible. Generally 
    the litter problem is very bad, especially after weekends. Youths are using 
    the tennis courts for late night football sessions and ignore all requests 
    to stop. Cllr Stuart reported that he had used a mechanical roller to create 
    a more even surface on the reseeded grass areas but the result was still not 
    good enough for a gang mower to be used.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that all the equipment was in good order although 
    complained that the base of each piece of equipment needed to be swept as 
    they were covered in grass cuttings. The Clerk was asked to inform Pauline 
    Rau, Chairperson Cerney Wick Village Committee that the pig wire fence to 
    the eastern side of the play area needs to be refixed in places.<br>
    <br>
    <b>BSC11 (Footpath from the School to the Barracks at Upper Up)</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to find out if any progress had been made regarding 
    BSC11 from Amanda Keys GCC PROW. Mrs Keys had informed the Clerk that the 
    subject was now tenth in line awaiting a Public Enquiry.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Parking Outside Strathmore</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to write to Mr &amp; Mrs A. Milsome, Strathmore, High Street 
    about parking of a commercial van on the public open space to the front 
    their property.<br>
    ..<br>
    <b>Water Hydrant Signs</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb again reported that the water hydrant sign opposite Oak Beams 
    in Station Road needed to be replaced.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Lake 16 Bridlepath</b><br>
    Cllr Harris told the Committee of a commitment that had been made some years 
    ago between the then owners of Lake 16 and Cotswold Water Park that a
