    Page 1: YOUTH DEPUTATION last line ­ delete ... boys ... insert &quot;young men&quot;<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Minutes as

    Minutes were signed by the Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>

    <strong>MATTERS ARISING<br>
    Jubilee Gardens</strong><br>
    Due to work load Cllr Nicholas would arrange a meeting with Martin Hutchings, Development
    Officer at CDC when he returned from his vacation.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Ramp</strong><br>
    Whitton Associates had presented an estimate to redesign the ramp access which if a
    planning application and tender process were included would cost approximately £2,300.
    After a meeting Cllr Squire and the Clerk had with Paula Postlethwaite and Malcolm Hope
    from GCC Highways a verbal quotation to create a footway from the ramp base opposite the
    Langet entrance to the car park including a cross over with drop kerbs some 25 metres
    along from the ramp would cost £4,729.30. The Finance and Playing Fields and Village
    Maintenance Committees had discussed the GCC Highways quotation at a joint meeting held on
    Monday evening and agreed to recommend that the Parish Council accept, subject to a
    written proposal, the scheme on offer from GCC Highways. This scheme was then formally
    proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb and the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Flower Tubs</strong><br>
    John C. Whittaker, Cotswold Area Traffic Manager at GCC Highways had no objection if the
    Parish Council placed flower urns at the village entrances so long as they did not form a
    hazard to traffic although he advised that details should be discussed with Divisional
    Manager, Martyn Summerell.<br>
    <br>

    Correspondence<br>
    A. R. Jones Head of Planning at CDC had written to explain a decision which conflicted
    with that of the Parish Council on CT.0776/Q regarding the erection of a detached dwelling
    on land adjacent to Walnut Tree Farmhouse, Upper Up, South Cerney. The CDC Committee
    considered the concerns expressed regarding the introduction of a new access onto the
    village street. This had been a requirement of the County Highways Authority. The
    Committee agreed with those concerns and granted permission subject to the submission of
    an amended plan to show the development accessed from the existing lane to the east of the
    site.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council would
    consider a meeting with Brian Murtagh Chairman of Four Pillars Hotels when it had sight of
    a complete plan with firm details of the materials to be used in construction. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>

    The Clerk reported that judgment for the claimant had been made and the Parish Council
    could now ask that enforcement proceedings be taken against the defendant by requesting a
    bailiff be appointed to recover goods to the value of the debt or an attachment to the
    defendant's earnings be made. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that
    an attachment of earnings be made on the defendant. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    Cllr Jay inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for July. It was proposed by
    Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council agrees to make the above
    payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Stuart had reported his dismay on Monday evening on the quality of the service
    provided by Jeremy Simmons Landscapes and recommended that half the payment be withheld.
    After the Clerk reported that he had been informed on Tuesday that Jeremy Simmons Ltd had
    ceased trading on Monday the Parish Council further agreed that an outstanding account due
    to Alex Lawrie Factors for £753.11 for ground maintenance by Jeremy Simmons Ltd be
    withheld in total.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Parish Council's Funds</strong><br>
    The Committee inspected and agreed the current accounts for the Upper Up Park and Village
    Hall Funds. The Clerk explained how Parish Council contingency and reserve funds were
    managed. The Committee was shown a budget analysis of Parish Council expenditure for the
    first four months of this financial year and agreed that so far outgoings were in line
    with the budget.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Maintenance Quotations</strong><br>
    Of the two quotations received to rehang the chains at the War Memorial (£42.50) and to
    replace the damaged guttering at the Bus Shelter (£125) R. O. W. Berry presented the more
    competitive costing. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that R.O.W.
    Berry be awarded the work. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Footpath at Upper Up</strong><br>
    GCC Highways had verbally informed the Clerk that it would arrange the administration and
    supervision of a new footpath, as discussed with Cllr Squire and the Clerk, between the
    Upper Up ramp and the car park if the Parish Council was prepared to pay £4,729.30
    towards its cost. If acceptable GCC Highways would insist that the contract for the work
    was agreed before February 2004 for completion in the current financial year. Cllr Jay
    said that funding would come from the Capital Fund set aside for road improvements. It was
    proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council ratifies the
    decision of the Finance Committee which had agreed to the Capital spend. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Members' Allowances</strong><br>
    Under new regulations Parish Councils may pay certain allowances to their Members. In
    response to a summary of the regulations it was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr
    Webb that the Parish Council notify CDC in principle that it intends to pay these
    allowances with effect from April 2004. The Parish Council was all in favour. Cllr Stuart
    advised that an amount should be budgeted for these payments in the next precept. Parish
    Councillors agreed unanimously to take up the offer from CDC to set allowances and to
    publish all payments made to members.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>South Cerney Playgroup</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the Parish Council
    agrees to a suggestion from South Cerney Playgroup to allow it to apply for planning
    permission in the name of South Cerney Parish Council.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 11 August.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd</strong><br>
    A representative of Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd failed to turn up at the meeting as
    arranged. The Clerk reported that he had been informed that Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd
    had gone into liquidation on Monday 11 August. Cllr Stuart recommended that J. V. Strong
    &amp; Co Ltd who had a grass cutting contract at the Duke of Gloucester barracks be
    contacted. Cllr Jay suggested that Cirencester Town Council be approached. Cllr Squire
    proposed that the local golf club be asked if it was interested in completing the contract
    until the end of the season. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Squire who volunteered to
    contact Mr Franklin with the proposal.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Flower Tubs</strong><br>
    John C. Whittaker, Cotswold Area Traffic Manager at GCC Highways had no objection if the
    Parish Council placed flower urns at the village entrances so long as they did not form a
    hazard to traffic although he advised that details should be discussed with Divisional
    Manager, Martyn Summerell.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Litter Picker</strong><br>
    The Committee agreed to invite Mr E. Curtis to its next meeting to discuss litter picking
    throughout the village.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the safety surfaces needed sweeping of dead grass. The
    litter bin had not been emptied and litter had blown about. Cllrs Mrs Chapman praised Cllr
    Caunce on the good job he had done trimming shrubs around the inside of the playing field
    although the hedge at the roadside needed to be cut back.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart stated that the grass at the Junior Swing was not adequately cut on the side
    near to the fence. The seats were showing signs of wear and the safety tiles were moving
    apart in several places. The tiles on the Senior Swing were not so bad. On the Slide cut
    grass and stones were spread over the base. Vandals had cut into the rail of the Activity
    Area in several places. The Basketball net must be renewed. Generally there was too much
    litter spread about, grassed area around the play area desperately needed to be cut and
    weeds against the road fence and under the car park fence required spraying.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that nettle roots at the Swing had been pulled out on 7 August but
    extra play bark was needed to make the equipment safe. The surrounding timbers enclosing
    the bark need to be replaced.The goal post at the football area had been moved but no
    attempt made by contractor to fill and seed worn out goal mouth. The sides of the
    pyracantha hedge had been cut but not the top. The nettles were sprayed on 15 July and
    then trimmed back. Grass is too long for kicking a ball about and needs cutting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    After a request by Cllr Mrs Chapman I contacted Michael Grace, CDC Enforcement Officer
    regarding building work at Mill Cottage, Cerney Wick. Consequently work was ordered to be
    halted and the builder instructed to abide by the granted application plans or to submit a
    new application. I enquired if there was any access restriction to Lake 11 (Jet Ski) from
    opposite the Education Lake on the Spine Road and to date I have not had a reply. Mr Grace
    would check with Ray Brassington, CDC Environmental Health, to find out what were the
    permitted operating times on Lake 11. I contacted Andrew Houldey GCC PROW and asked for a
    progress report on BSC15. He stated that as there had been two objectors namely Mr Slator
    and Mr Hayward the file had been passed to the Secretary of State for determination. On 1
    August I met with Mr Simon King and together we made an application for a grant to CDC
    Community Fund to help finance play equipment refurbishment at Robert Franklin Way. I also
    contacted the Countryside Agency with further information in the hope that that
    organisation may be persuaded to also allocate funding. On Tuesday 5 August Cllr Squire
    and myself met with Paula Postlethwaite GCC Highways and discussed the plans for traffic
    management in High Street and Station Road. On Friday 8 August I visited Natasha McKenna
    to discuss the application which had been made. She pointed out various inconsistencies
    and asked for up to date quotations from suppliers. I informed Mr King of her comments but
    it is obvious that if the Parish Council is serious in refurbishing RFW play area a more
    active part must be played by Parish Councillors in its planning.<br>
    <br>
    As agreed I kept a record of time spent on Parish Council duties. Of the 21 working days
    in March I logged 78 hours which I averages 3 hours 40 minutes per day.<br>
    In April of the 20 working days available I logged 66.5 hours which I averages 3 hours 20
    minutes per day. Due to my cardiac event in May I was on sick leave until the beginning of
    July and no time sheet record was kept during this period.<br>
    In July I worked 83.25 hours which averages 3 hours 37 minutes per available working day.
    Although the extra time spent on Parish Council duties seems insignificant on a daily
    basis cumulatively it represents between 2.5 and 3.3 hours a week more than my original
    contract of 15 hours per week. In the 5 years since I became Clerk the work load has
    gradually increased and shows no sign of getting any less ­ rather the opposite in fact.
    I therefore ask the Parish Council to consider increasing my contract by 3 hours per week
    and back date the increase to March 2003.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the Personnel Committee including Cllrs Jay, Nicholas, and
    Webb meet with the Chairman and Vice Chairman at Rose Cottage at 7pm on Tuesday 26 August
    to discuss the Clerk's proposal.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>IMPACT SCHEME</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to express the concern of the Parish Council regarding the Impact
    Scheme planned for High Street and Station Road to GCC Highways especially the
    installation of a zebra crossing. The principal objective of the Parish Council was to
    have Station Road and High Street resurfaced throughout. The Clerk was asked to copy the
    letter to Cllr S. Parsons (GCC), Cllr Baines (CDC), Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Mrs Clark
    (CDC).<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had written expressing his concern at the time it is taking to organise the
    new play equipment at Robert Franklin Way play area. The Clerk explained that two attempts
    to obtain grant funding for the project were in progress. Unfortunately since the new
    Parish Council was formed the sub-committee of the previous Council had collapsed and
    there was no representative from the Parish Council to direct the scheme. Mr Simon King
    who was a former Parish Councillor and the Clerk had made an application to the Community
    Fund at CDC but quotations and plans did not match and the grants co-ordinator Natasha
    McKenna has asked for clarification and new up to date quotations. Cllr Squire volunteered
    to progress the application and would liaise with Mr King. Cllr Mrs Chubb and the Clerk
    would support Cllr Squire in his efforts.<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the planting of both trees and shrubs and the pond margins at
    Upper Up Park needed to be organised so that work can begin this winter. Whitton
    Associates' design for tree planting will need adjusting and there is no specification for
    the wetland planting or any planting in the water. These are important to give an
    attractive site. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Smith that Whitton
    Associates be instructed to prepare a specification for the planting and put it out to
    tender to appropriate contractors. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Harris wrote that he was concerned that youths had gained access to the high rope
    course on Lake 16 having broken through the surrounding fence. The Clerk had reported the
    problem to the Health and Safety section at CDC.<br>
    Cllr Squire reported that an inspection chamber in Church Lane outside The Manor was loose
    and the Clerk had informed GCC Highways.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the trees on the northern side of Station Road which were
    overgrowing and blocking visibility when accessing the highway had now been cut back.<br>
    Cllr Squire informed the Parish Council that the PCC had spent £1,167 to date on the
    registration of title and other costs for the extension to the graveyard and requested
    that the Parish Council consider making this payment as part of its agreed grant. Cllr Jay
    remarked that the Parish Council had agreed to await a grant application for the whole
    project.<br>
    Cllr Stuart asked that the Parish Council extend its grateful thanks to Mrs Stuart for
    standing in for the Clerk during his recent illness. Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Webb
    seconded that a formal vote of thanks be made to Mrs Stuart. The Parish Council was all in
    favour although Cllr Stuart abstained.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 10.10pm. </td>
