    Matters arising would be dealt within Committees deliberations.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On 19th May I attended the Annual Parish Meeting in the Village Hall. On 
    20th May I attended a briefing on the organisation of the RIAT at RAF 
    Fairford. The organisers outlined their plans to handle traffic in the area 
    during the air show on 16th to 18th July. On 21st May I delivered the 
    accounts for the Parish Council to the Internal Auditor Mrs J. Gardiner for 
    analysis and final preparation. Overall in May of the 17 available working 
    days I averaged 3hrs 55 mins per day which is in excess of the 3hrs 36mins 
    my contract allows but acceptable.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee 
    which had met on 7 June.<br>
    Mr Jon Ede and Mr Brian Murtagh, Chairman of Four Pillars Hotels Ltd had 
    been welcomed to the meeting by the Parish Council Chairman, Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Election of Chairman</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that Cllr 
    Nicholas, if he is willing, be re-elected in his absence as Chairman of the 
    Planning Committee. The Committee was all in favour. Cllr Nicholas had 
    informed the Clerk that he would accept the role.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Election of Vice Chairman</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Webb that Cllr Mrs

    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Trees on Headland at Lake 16</b><br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) reported that Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had attended a meeting 
    on site with the tree/landscape officer from CDC on June 3. Cllr Bennett had 
    been unable to attend the meeting due to work commitments. At the end of the 
    walk around and examination of the trees on the site and a view from 
    Kingfisher Place, Cllr Mrs Clark was satisfied that everything was being 
    handled in the correct way and there will be no mass felling of trees. She 
    did not think that the proposed work will damage the view from Kingfisher 
    Place. Some trees will be pruned and others will be removed. These will 
    mainly be of the small shrubby type and those in poor condition. The work 
    proposed is in keeping with good tree husbandry. A tree planting scheme has 
    been approved.<br>

    <b>Four Pillars Presentation</b><br>
    Mr Jon Ede displayed a cardboard three dimensional model of the proposed 
    hotel. Final decisions on colour and types of material had yet to be decided 
    but the Four Pillars Hotels Ltd would be guided by Cotswold District Council 
    planners. Overall the appearance would be one of glass and wood with the 
    ground floor walls mostly in reconstructed stone. The assembled Parish 
    Councillors made it clear to Mr Ede and Mr Murtagh their disappointment that 
    the Cotswold Water Park Society would be the main beneficiary of the Section 
    106 Agreement. Mr Murtagh explained the decision was not in his control but 
    pointed out that last year the hotel group had contributed in excess of 
    £100,000 to charity and would be willing to make donations to worthwhile 
    local causes in the future. Mr Murtagh informed the Committee that there 
    were outstanding negotiations over land adjoining the site to the east with 
    the Cotswold Water Park Society which should be resolved shortly. Building 
    work was expected to begin early 2005 and completion anticipated in summer 
    2006. At 7.45pm both visitors left the meeting.<br>

    The Committee decided that this site is already over-developed; this very

    acceptable degree. The Committee agreed to object and ratification of its

    <b>Planning Permission granted by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/V</b><br>
    Revision to previously approved development of holiday lodges with reduced 
    number to 50 and amended designs at Lake 16, Station Road, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Conditions to note are: 4. The development shall not start before a 
    comprehensive scheme of landscaping has been approved in writing by the 
    Local Planning Authority. The scheme must show the location, size and 
    condition of all existing trees and hedgerows on and adjoining the land and 
    identify those to be retained, together with measures for their protection 
    during construction work. It must also show details of all planting areas, 
    species and proposed means of enclosure and screening, including mounding, 
    walls and fences with details of the materials of which they will be built 
    and details of all the paving and other hard surface materials to be used 
    throughout the proposed development.<br>
    Reason: The proposed development and its location is such that in accordance 
    with Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 41, landscaping is necessary to 
    enable it to fit in with its surroundings, enhance the locality and to 
    enhance the quality of the development itself for those using it. The 
    Council places a high priority on good quality landscaping.<br>
    Condition 5: Any trees or plants shown on the approved landscaping scheme to 
    be planted or retained which die, are removed, are damaged or become 
    diseased, or grassed areas which become eroded or damaged, within 5 (five) 
    years of the completion of the approved landscaping scheme, shall be 
    replaced by the end of the next planting season. Replacement trees and 
    plants shall be of the same size and species as those lost, unless the Local 
    Planning Authority approves alternatives in writing.<br>
    Reason: To ensure that the planting becomes established and thereby achieves 
    the objective of Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 41.<br>
    Condition 6: Before any site preparation work or development starts each 
    tree to be retained or that is protected by a Tree Preservation Order, shall 
    be securely fenced to protect the area within the crown spread of a radius 
    equal to half of the height of the tree, whichever is the greater to accord 
    with BSI 58371991, Trees in Relation to Construction. Within the area(s) 
    fenced off no fires shall be lit and the existing ground level shall remain 
    the same and no building materials, temporary buildings or surplus soil 
    shall be placed, tipped or stored on it. If any trenches for services are 
    required in the fenced off area(s), they shall be excavated and back-filled 
    by hand and any tree roots encountered which have a diameter of 2cms or 
    more, shall not be severed.<br>
    Reason: To ensure that the tree(s) are protected during construction work, 
    in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 25.<br>
    Condition 8: The sole means of vehicular access to the site shall be a new 
    access laid out, constructed and thereafter maintained in Station Road in 
    the position shown on the submitted plans with 10m kerbed entry and exit 
    radii and a minimum entrance width of 5.5m. Any gates shall be located at 
    least 4m from the bridleway edge with the wall splayed back at 45 degrees. 
    The area of access road within 20m of the carriageway edge shall be surfaced 
    in a suitable permanent material, the details of which shall be approved by 
    the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of development.<br>
    Reason: In the interests of highway safety. This condition is imposed in the 
    light of PPG13. The Clerk was to ask Phil Clueley to confirm that this 
    Condition complies to the requirements of the GCC PROW.<br>
    Condition 9: No part of the development (except for the construction of the 
    site access onto Station Road) shall commence until the existing vehicular 
    access onto the Spine Road B4696 has been stopped up and its vehicular use 
    permanently abandoned in a manner to be agreed in writing beforehand by the 
    Local Planning Authority.<br>
    Reason: In the interests of Highway Safety. The existing access onto the 
    B4696 has substandard visibility and its use as an access to this 
    development would result in unacceptable hazards.<br>
    Condition 13: No public address system, tannoy or other amplified 
    communication system shall be used on the site,without the prior express 
    permission of the Local Planning Authority.<br>
    Reason: to protect the rural character of the area. This condition is 
    imposed in the light of Policy 2 of the Cotswold District Local Plan.<br>
    Condition 14: The holiday units shall not be occupied from the 6th day of 
    January until the 5th day of February inclusive each year.<br>
    Reason: This is development which is only permitted at this location because 
    it provides holiday accommodation. This needs to be carefully controlled. 
    This condition is imposed in the light of advice in PPG21.<br>
    Condition 24: Prior to the commencement of development a scheme for off-site 
    signing, to discourage vehicular traffic from passing through South Cerney 
    shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The 
    agreed scheme shall be implemented in accordance with details which shall 
    form part of the submitted scheme.<br>
    Reason: To discourage traffic from using South Cerney as a through route. 
    This condition is imposed in the light of PPG13.<br>

    22. CDC – CT.0144/4/T: Explanation of permission decision on land adjacent

    <br>
    <b>Election of Chairman</b><br>

    <br>
    <b>Election of Vice Chairman</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Stuart that Cllr Jay, if 
    he is willing, be elected in his absence as Vice Chairman of the Finance 
    Committee. The Committee was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    Parish Council Chairman’s Telephone Account<br>
    Cllr Stuart declared a prejudicial interest and left the room.<br>
    The Finance Committee recommends that the Parish Council considers the 
    expenses on a demand basis and that the amount is revised in next year’s 
    budget. The Parish Council was in agreement.<br>
    Cllr Stuart rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>2003-2004 Audit</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council accepts the deliberations of the internal auditor. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour. The Chairman Cllr Stuart and the Clerk would sign 
    the accounts and notification of the time and place where they could be 
    inspected would be posted on the noticeboard in accordance with the specific 
    instructions given by the Auditor, Moore Stephens &amp; Co.<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that 
    the Parish Council agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick Village Committee insurance grant</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce had requested that a grant be considered towards the insurance 
    costs of the Cerney Wick Village Hall. The Clerk reminded the Committee that 
    as the hall was only available to residents of Cerney Wick and not the wider 
    community a grant would be inappropriate. The Committee recommends that the 
    Parish Council rejects awarding such a grant. It was proposed by Cllr Webb 
    and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the Parish Council accepts the 
    recommendation of the Finance Committee. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Graveyard Wall</b><br>
    Cllr Squire was pleased to announce that the construction of the graveyard 
    wall had been completed. The Clerk had provided copy invoices to enable him 
    to claim the agreed grant from CDC. Overall the budget had only been 
    overspent by £300 which was more than acceptable when the extra work to 
    remove the concrete was taken into consideration. The Clerk was asked to 
    thank Mr W. A. Eaton for the superb job he had done in building the wall.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance &amp; 
    Playing Fields Committee which had met on 7 June.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Election of Chairman</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Stuart that Cllr Squire 
    be reelected as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
    Committee. The Committee was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Election of Vice Chairman</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Harris that Cllr Stuart 
    be reelected as Vice Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
    Committee. The Committee was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Turf at Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform Adrian Gibbs that the turf had not been laid 
    in a satisfactory manner as the under surface had not been cultivated. The 
    Committee propose that the Parish Council should agree to settle the 
    material costs only on sight of a purchase invoice from the original 
    supplier. The material used at the entrance to the enclosed play area was 
    incorrect. The Clerk was to instruct Adrian Gibbs to remove the ballast he 
    supplied, replace it using the “as dug” or “as raised” laid wet and 
    compacted to give a hard top finish. The material required is available from 
    Hills Quarry at Shorncote.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Ham Lane</b><br>
    As no reply had yet been received from Sapco One Ltd regarding the access 
    from Sudeley Drive to Ham Lane the Committee recommends that the Clerk sends 
    by recorded delivery notification that it is the intention of the Parish 
    Council to create a concrete ramp through the hedge from Sudeley Drive to 
    Ham Lane. In the event that no reply is received the Clerk is to inform them 
    that work on the project will begin during August 2004. Cllr Stuart 
    suggested that advice on the construction be sought from Phil Clueley, GCC 
    PROW officer.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Footpath/Bridleway Work</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Committee of his meeting with Phil Clueley and 
    others to discuss the refurbishment of the footpath from Bow Wow to Church 
    Lane. GCC PROW will submit a price of approximately £400 for the gates which 
    will be probably funded from GCC coffers. Written confirmation is awaited 
    from Allan Thompson who was keen that his team will be able to do the work. 
    Phil Clueley was optimistic that the Wildmoorway Lane project will proceed. 
    He would look into the Northmoor Lane to Bow Wow route and was aware of the 
    historical proposal to create a bridlepath to Ham Lane along the north shore 
    of Lake 16.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart and Cllr Jay met Laura Oakley (GRCC) on 25 May at Rose Cottage, 
    Upper Up, South Cerney to discuss the village plan. A draft timetable of 
    events to form the basis of a plan was prepared. Cllr Stuart asked the 
    assembled members to individually prepare a wish list of 10 major items 
    which would contribute to the preparation of a working plan. Cllr Smith 
    suggested that a forum be opened on the web site to encourage discussion. 
    Cllr Stuart agreed to liaise with Raymond Fenton. Cllr Stuart will call a 
    meeting of the sub committee in the near future.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that there was a continuing problem with the safety 
    tiles although the situation was no worse than previous. The Clerk was to 
    ask GPFA for advice on how to make the access easier for younger children to 
    enjoy the slide. The cycle mounds were very much in use and youngsters were 
    building new jumps along the line of the pipe which would be used when the 
    drainage project is complete. The Clerk was to write to inform the Football 
    Club that the Parish Council was disappointed that the Football Club had 
    failed to remove several bags of rubbish after their fund raising event as 
    requested by the Parish Council when permission to use the facility had been 
    granted.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the 360 degree swing was still inoperable and 
    asked the Clerk to chase Macventure Play for a solution. The train units are 
    showing signs of instability. Grass in the toddlers area needs cutting and 
    also in the north west corner of the playing field. The Clerk was asked to 
    report acts of anti social behaviour occurring in the vicinity of the play 
    area. Cllr Harris was not happy with the condition of the safety surface, 
    especially around the 360 degree swing and the Clerk was asked to inform 
    Macventure Play.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman had asked that the Clerk contact Cllr Caunce to see if he 
    was prepared to carry out the Cerney Wick play area inspections. Cllr Caunce 
    informed the Clerk that he would liaise with Cllr Mrs Chapman.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Grass Cutting</b><br>
    The Clerk was to inform Adrian Gibbs that grass cutting in the area in the 
    vicinity of the War Memorial was unsatisfactory and cut grass should be 
    collected and removed. He was also to ask Mr Gibbs to include the small area 
    opposite the Londis in the grass cutting schedule.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Wall at Sunset Cottage</b><br>
    Cllr Squire asked that the occupants of Sunset Cottage are informed that the 
    wall to the side of their property on Station Road was unstable and in 
    danger of collapsing.<br>
