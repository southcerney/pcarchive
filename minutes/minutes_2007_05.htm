 <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT" COLOR="#231f20">
 <p>Cllr Parsons (GCC) had sent an apology for his absence but would attend the
 Annual Parish Meeting on the 16th May.</p>
 <p><b>DECLARATIONS OF OFFICE</b> <br>
 All Parish Councillors signed Declarations of Office which the Clerk witnessed. </p>
 <p><b>ELECTION OF CHAIRMAN</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Webb seconded a resolution that Cllr Stuart be

 Council. </p>
 <p><b>ELECTION OF VICE-CHAIRMAN</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb proposed and Cllr Jay seconded a resolution that Cllr Nicholas be

 pro-active and the previous incumbent. </p>
 <p><b>MEMBERSHIP OF COMMITTEES</b> </p>
 <p><b>All Committees</b> <br>
 Both the Chairman Cllr Stuart and Vice Chairman Cllr Nicholas are automatically
 members of the Planning, Finance and Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance

 <p><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT </b></p>
 <p>Thomas Nicholas reported that members of the Youth Parish Council (YPC) had
 attended training on communicating with the press at the CDC offices in
 Cirencester. Cllr Stuart informed him that he and the Clerk had an appointment
 on 17th May with Stephen Wood from Komplan to discuss the possibility of
 installing a MUGA. The YPC will be thoroughly consulted before any decision is
 taken. Thomas stated that a member of the YPC would make a presentation at the
 Annual Parish Meeting on 16th May.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 18th APRIL 2007</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2246: 3rd paragraph delete: Mrs Chapman … insert:
 Caunce </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr
 Mrs Chubb that the Minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. Cllr
 Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker abstained as they
 were not present. The remainder of the Parish Councillors were all in favour
 and Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay once again reported that the bus stop sign
 outside “Content” in Station Road had not been repaired. The Clerk will liaise
 with Cllr Bennett (CDC) and report to Gloucestershire Highways that the
 incident had not yet been dealt with. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay agreed with Cllr Mrs Chubb who stated that the
 open ditch in Station Road had not been cleaned. The Clerk reported that an
 email received on the 8th May from Keren James, Customer Relations at Thames
 Water had stated that the work had been completed by 5th May. As it was now the
 9th the Clerk would inform Ms James of the situation. Cllr Jay informed the
 meeting that a dishwasher which had been dumped in the ditch had been removed
 by Mr David Chubb. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris again enquired if any reply had been received
 regarding compensation for damage caused to Jim Parker’s tree. The Clerk
 responded negatively but would look into the matter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris stated that the reply from the Enforcement
 Officer (CDC) was incorrect in stating that the lodge on Lake 15 was only used
 on a temporary basis as a sales office. It is open for far longer and Mr Grace
 should be directed to check the advertisements relating in the local press. He
 stated that the original planning permission curtailed the use of the lodges
 for hire only. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris was disappointed that no action had been taken
 by the Enforcement Officer (CDC) over the display of advertisements on the
 chain link fence at the junction of the B4696 (Spine Road), Cerney Wick Lane
 and Station Road. The Parish Council had been objecting for years and nothing
 ever seems to happen. The Clerk will inform Mr Grace about his concerns on both
 these matters. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council had no objection to the public seat
 which had been removed from Robert Franklin Way play area being installed on
 the horse shoe shaped hill on the Upper Up playing field. <br>
 Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a potential contractor and left
 the room. <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that James Harris
 Contracting installs the seat for £60 on the recommended site at Upper Up. The
 Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
 Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that the signs had been ordered for the
 Robert Franklin Way play area. Cllr Stuart proposed that Upper Up play area
 could also benefit but Cllr Jay and Cllr Caunce objected and it was agreed that
 the Parish Council would wait for the police statement on the recently
 witnessed vandalism. Cllr Jay extracted figures from a MAIDeN statistical
 report which purported that there were 199 youths aged between 10-14 and 235
 15-19 year olds. Of these only a very small group were misbehaving and it was
 unfair on the majority to restrict their use of the play area. Cllr Stuart
 stated that the PCSO would make more regular patrols of the area and suggested
 that the YPC should be involved in the search for a solution to the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to ask Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire
 Highways to recover the broken “Kept Left” bollard which is stored at the rear
 of the Village Hall. The Clerk was to remind her that the protruding stumps of
 Lady Fanshawe's hedge in Bow Wow restricting the access thereof, the manhole
 covers outside &quot;Content&quot; in Station Road and &quot;Londis&quot; shop in Broadway Lane all
 needed attention. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Laura Mills who has taken over from Sinead Barker at GRCC
 requested permission to forward the agreed draft, including the personal
 details collected, of the Housing Needs Survey, to the Cotswold District
 Council. Cllr Nicholas was concerned that that would be in breach of the
 anonymity clause agreed to before the survey was carried out. Cllr Nicholas
 would liaise with Ms Mills and report back to the Parish Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I would like to welcome new members and established
 members of the Parish Council to this, the first meeting of this four year
 session. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After exhaustive enquiries I was able to determine that
 only a few houses in Beverstone Road were managed by a housing association. It
 is probable that most of the properties are either owner occupied or out on
 rent through private landlords. Responsibility for the upkeep of the hedge is
 therefore impossible to identify. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the 27th April I delivered the Parish Council’s
 accounts to Mrs J. Gardiner who will conduct an internal audit prior to sending
 them to Moore Stephens Accountants in Bath for audit. I collected the completed
 audited accounts on Tuesday 8th May and will circulate them to the Chairman,
 Vice Chairman and a member of the Finance Committee for their information. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Keen observers of our web site will notice that minutes of
 meetings are published after they are approved which usually means a delay of
 at least four weeks from the date of the meeting until publication. A recent
 article stated that minutes can be published sooner if it is made clear that
 they are unapproved. Would the Parish Council agree to this change of procedure
 in order to positively interact with the community? The Parish Council was in
 agreement for a trial period. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During April, of the 15 available working days, I averaged
 3 hours 50 minutes per day which is about 20 minutes a day more than my
 contract allows.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLAY AREAS INSPECTION REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the site was all in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the phenolic ply steps on the adventure unit were
 starting to rot and would require monitoring. On the gates two ring latches
 needed to be replaced and a hinge needed attention. There was evidence that an
 attempt had been made to light a fire on the safety matting. The ground where
 the tower slide had been needed about 3 tonnes of top soil and seeding. Cllr
 Stuart will liaise with the Pay Back in Community group and inform Cllr Harris
 when they will be available. Cllr Harris will then arrange the delivery of the
 top soil. The seat has now been removed. The area in the vicinity of the goal
 posts needed a half tonne of top soil to fill in the holes and then seeded. The
 grass in the toddlers play area had not been cut during the last visit by the
 contractors.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the green play surface around the activity area had
 been cut but it was impossible to ascertain whether it had been done with the
 grass mower or by a knife. There was no sign of the missing piece and other
 areas are showing signs of tampering. It was agreed to get the supplier’s agent
 to look at the problem and quote for work. Work had commenced on the sewerage
 pipe line across the field. The fencing had been erected neatly. The top soil
 had been removed and some of it was being stored on the top of the cycle
 mounds. Cllr Stuart helped Cllr Harris to water the trees with the Bowls Club’s
 pump. The grass cutting looks very good and the weeds were sprayed a few days
 ago. The safety surface of the large activity area needed to be topped up with
 sand. The large green collection bins had been defaced with graffiti although
 the culprits had signed their work which made detection rather easy. The police
 have been informed.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TO CONSIDER APPLICATIONS FOR FUNDING FROM LAKE 6 (FOUR
 PILLARS HOTEL) S.106 CONTRIBUTION FUND</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As part of the planning permission for the erection of a
 hotel at Lake 6, South Cerney in the Cotswold Water Park a section 106 legal
 agreement was signed by Cotswold District Council and Cotswold Four Pillars
 Ltd, the hotel developers. Under this legal agreement Cotswold Four Pillars are
 contributing £100,000 to conserving and enhancing the wildlife and landscape of
 the Water Park. Cotswold District Council is administering the way in which the
 £100,000 is to be spent. The deadline for application for funds is 26th June
 2007. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land suggested that an application be made to
 create pathways on roadways from the village to developments on the Spine Road.
 The Parish Council was in favour. Cllr Jay on behalf of South Cerney Trust with
 the support of the Parish Council will apply to the fund for a grant to create
 traffic calming schemes in the village. Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart will liaise
 with Dr Simon Pickering from the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd and Mike
 Barton of GCC Public Rights of Way respectively on a scheme to create a pathway
 from Upper Up to Keynes Park.</p>
