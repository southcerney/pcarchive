    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr King, Cllr Mrs Pearse and Cllr Parsons (GCC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 11 SEPTEMBER 2002</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Minutes were a
    true and accurate record. The Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr Dunn, Cllr
    Gardiner, Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr Mrs Spriggs who were not present at the meeting in
    September, was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    Matters arising were debated at Committee stage and would be discussed when the Chairmen
    of the Committees made their reports.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 7
    October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Orchard House</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to thank Mr G. Watson (CDC) for his informative reply regarding
    queries raised about the fence and the removal of trees at Orchard House. In the event of
    the demise of the lime tree CDC should be urged to prosecute those responsible and to
    inform Ms Lloyd of the intended action. Mr M. Grace Enforcement Officer (CDC) had informed
    the Clerk that although permission was not necessary for the decking at Orchard House it
    would be needed for the 9ft breeze block wall and Ms Lloyd would shortly make a
    retrospective application for permission.<br>
    <strong>Advertisement at Watermark, Station Road</strong><br>
    Mr M. Grace would check whether the large Watermark advertisement at the junction of
    Station Road and the Spine Road was contrary to planning regulations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    CT.0144/4/M<br>
    Two storey side extension; front and rear porch at 8 Robert Franklin Way, South Cerney,
    Cirencester (for ratification)<br>
    NO OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    CT.1454/3/T<br>
    Temporary dwelling (mobile home) at Rainbow Lakes, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney<br>
    No genuine justification for a new dwelling on this site. Any development would be
    detrimental to the visual amenity of this rural area.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    CT.1799/E<br>
    Demolition of existing porch and erection of new porch at Box Cottage, High Street, South
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    CT.2003/Q<br>
    Single storey rear extension to provide utility, playroom, sun lounge, study and WC at 2
    The Old School, School Lane, South Cerney (for ratification)<br>
    NO OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    CT.2648/2/Z<br>
    50 holiday lodges, cable tow water ski course with clubhouse, boating lake and boathouse,
    restaurant and shop with office over at Lake 11, Spine Road, South Cerney (deferment
    agreed) In the context of other recent adjacent planning permissions &quot;enough is
    enough&quot;. A two-storey building for a restaurant and shop with offices over would be a
    considerable visual intrusion. If permission was granted single storey dwellings would be
    preferred. A development of this scale would swamp the nearby village of Cerney Wick.
    Fifty further dwellings connected to the main sewerage infrastructure would be
    unsustainable.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    CT.5485/H<br>
    Minor amendment to extension to outbuilding to allow use as garage for two (2) cars;
    change of access to property at The Barn, Cerney Wick (deferment agreed)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    CT.7318/D<br>
    Two car garage with roof workshop. Upper storey extension to provide an extended bedroom
    at Mill Cottage, Cerney Wick (deferment agreed) A two-storey garage was far too large for
    this site. Concern was expressed that, if permission was granted, the use of the first
    floor for offices/workshop would be intrusive to the neighbouring house because of its
    proximity. A letter of objection had been received from a neighbour.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    CT.7719/B<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb declared an interest in this application. Renewal of outline planning
    permission ref CT.7719/A for residential development and the construction of vehicular and
    pedestrian access at Box Bush Farm, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    CT.8262<br>
    Demolition of bungalow and shed and the erection of three (3) detached cottages, garages
    to plots 2 and 3 and formation of vehicular access at Dunromin and the adjoining coal yard
    Silver Street, South Cerney Cllr Mrs Spriggs declared an interest as a neighbour and Cllr
    Stuart declared a professional interest in this application. The remainder of the Parish
    Council agreed that three dwellings were too many on this site. The site frontage was not
    big enough to accommodate them. Historically the site floods and further development will
    increase this possibility. There was also concern about the proximity of a bus stop to the
    proposed site. The Parish Council agreed with the owner of the neighbouring property
    Merlins (Sunnycot) that according to the plan one of the proposed new dwellings would be
    intrusively close.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    With the exception of CT.7719/B and CT.8262&nbsp; in which Parish Councillors had declared
    an interest it was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Mrs Gardiner that the rest
    of the Parish Council agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to
    ratify its decisions. Those Parish Councillors who had not declared an interest were all
    in favour. It was also proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that
    the Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr Mrs Chubb, agrees not to object to
    application CT.7719/B. The Parish Council was all in favour. It was further proposed by
    Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr
    Mrs Spriggs and Cllr Stuart, accepts the deliberation of the Planning Committee to object
    to application CT.8262. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    &nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT.0006/3/J Appeal to Secretary of State for the Environment by
    Westbury Homes for residential redevelopment of CAMAS site to provide 30 dwellings<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Dunn to support the
    decision of CDC to refuse planning permission for this application for the following
    reasons:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The site is outwith the local development plan.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a recent decision, which dismissed an appeal for
    a much larger scheme regarding development on this site, the Secretary of State for the
    Environment noted that for settlements allocated to the fourth tier in the local plan it
    is intended not to provide for a greater scale of development than that currently allowed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary of State for the Environment also noted
    that Cotswold District Council foresees no difficulty in meeting, or even exceeding, the
    residual requirement in the Structure Plan without any contribution from the appeal site
    and that the appellant did not dispute this point.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary of State for the Environment agreed that
    oversupply of land through either the Local Plan or Development Control processes will, in
    sustainability terms, be profligate and thus fail to represent a prudent use of resources.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secretary of State for the Environment considered
    that there is adequate available land in more sustainable locations to meet housing
    provision without need to redevelop the appeal site.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the appeal is upheld it would set a precedent for
    further development.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development would create traffic problems within
    the village.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross border consultation on the erection of a replacement concrete
    batch plant at Cleveland Farm complex<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on
    7 October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Response from Audit Commission</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that no reply had been received.<br>
    <strong>S.106 Agreement payments re The Limes</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Spriggs and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council
    agrees to purchase one seat for the Limes to be financed from £8,000 (commuted sum) to be
    placed on the area adjacent to the electricity sub-station to the front of the
    development. The remainder of the commuted sum should be allocated for legal fees to
    transfer the land to the Parish Council and for &quot;off-site&quot; play equipment. The
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>South Cerney Football Club</strong><br>
    A cheque in payment for water fees had been returned by the bank with instructions to

    <strong>Safety Inspection</strong><br>
    Wicksteed Leisure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BMX Ramp Inspection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £35.25<br>
    As Cornhill Insurance insisted on a safety inspection report before it would agree to
    insure the ramp the Clerk had organised this. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and
    seconded by Cllr Mrs Gardiner that the Parish Council ratifies this action. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Awaiting Response&nbsp; </strong><br>
    District Audit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audit Fees for 2000­2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £571.05<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Internal Audit</strong><br>
    The Clerk attended an internal audit inspection by Mr I. Selkirk at Northleach Community
    Centre on 24 and 27 September. The Auditor recommended that the Parish Council consider
    all the risks it may encounter during the year and to ensure that the insurance cover is
    adequate. He advised to minute the outcome of such deliberations. The Clerk was to enquire
    from Mr Selkirk what potential hazards, in his opinion, should be considered.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Disabled Ramp Interim Payment</strong><br>
    T. Sibbick (T.D. Construction) requested the Parish Council to consider making an interim
    payment for work completed so far on disabled ramp at Upper Up.<br>
    T.D. Construction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interim payment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £8225.00<br>
    T.D. Construction had quoted £620 ex VAT to adjust the positioning of the guard rails so
    that the width of the lower ramp complied with current legislation. The Parish Council did
    not accept that the plans for the ramp were inaccurate and the contractor should have been
    aware of the legislation. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr
    Nicholas that if the Clerk could get T.D Construction to halve his quotation to £310 ex
    VAT to alter the guard rails the Parish Council would agree to make the interim payment
    requested. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    Contracting)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; As K. Richings had given the lowest verbal quote of £50 to cut down the dead
    cherry tree to below ground level in Clarks Hay it was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and
    seconded by Cllr Mrs Gardiner that the Parish Council accepts.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour<br>
    32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External Auditor Moore Stephens seeking Annual Return<br>
    34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLCC ­ Salary Awards<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The Clerk pointed out that in June he had received notification that the<br>
    mileage allowance had been set at 49.4p per mile based on a fuel price of<br>
    70.02p per litre. A revised mileage allowance in the Salary Award information had reduced
    the amount to 49.1p per mile based on a fuel price of 80.22p per litre. The Clerk had
    queried the figures with GRCC who advised that the figures were not accurate and an
    amendment would be issued in due course. The Personnel Committee comprising Cllr Gardiner,
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Mrs Spriggs will meet to discuss the Salary
    Award and the Clerk's annual assessment<br>

    <strong>PLAYING FIELD &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 7 October. Mr I. Roberts had attended the meeting. Mr I.
    Roberts was concerned with the state of the river after the recent bridge repairs. The
    Clerk informed him that Mr D. Taylor (GCC Highways) had already contacted the Environment
    Agency and Ringway (contractors who had made the repairs) about the debris left behind. Mr
    Roberts would like the Parish Council to consider asking the power company to bury the
    unsightly overhead cables. The Committee agreed with his suggestion that the PROW between
    School Lane and Meadow Way be included in the ground maintenance contract.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising<br>
    Street Lighting</strong><br>
    The Clerk had nothing further to report.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Tower Slide</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported the difficulties he was experiencing in obtaining a quotation for a
    scramble type net for the slide. Companies contacted were reluctant to provide equipment
    for another supplier's kit. One quote had been verbally received from Wicksteed Leisure
    for a triangular shaped net 1.65m (base) x 1.45m (top) x 1.5m (high) for £425 plus 5%
    carriage totalling £524.34 inc VAT. Cllr Harris suggested that the Clerk contact a
    further two suppliers Hags Play and Tailor Made for quotations. Cllr Harris and Cllr
    Stuart would re-inspect the apparatus and make a more accurate note of the dimensions for
    the scramble net required.<br>
    <strong>Ramp at Upper Up</strong><br>
    It had been pointed out that the width of the new ramp did not comply with the Disability
    Act requirement of 1.2m clearance. The width of the lower pathway had been reduced to less
    than the required minimum when the guard rails were installed. It was agreed that the
    guard rails would have to be repositioned onto the crown of the wall which would then give
    the clearance needed.<br>
    <strong>Willow Trees</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that Virginia McClure (CDC) had not yet contacted the landowner Mr
    R. Webb. Cllr Gardiner agreed to accompany Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart to make an
    inventory, over the winter period, of all the trees for which the Parish Council was
    responsible.<br>
    <strong>Maintenance of Public Open Spaces</strong><br>
    The Clerk had informed Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd to include grass cutting to the front
    and other public areas on the Limes for the remainder of the season. Cllr Harris asked
    that invoices for the ground maintenance be more specific with details of the days the
    contractors worked. Complaints had been received that the graveyard had only been half cut
    and asked the Clerk to inform the contractors. Cllr Harris reported that nettles on Robert
    Franklin Way playing field needed attention. Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the area beyond
    the football and cricket pitches at Upper Up had not been cut low enough. Cllr Harris
    agreed with Cllr Mrs Chubb that the contractors be asked to strim the ditch in Station
    Road to water level.<br>
    <strong>Trees on The Piece</strong><br>
    Only one quote had been received for this project.<br>
    <strong>Street Signs</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform Mr R. Bull (CDC) that the sign for Willow Grove was damaged,
    the supporting post of the Clarks Hay sign near the cross was also damaged, the sign for
    Riverway was missing and there were no street signs for Lakeside.<br>
    <strong>Bledisloe Cup</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Committee that the Bledisloe Cup sign had been collected by
    representatives of this year's winners.<br>
    <strong>Access to Sub Station at Limes</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris requested the Clerk to contact the power company which had installed the hard
    standing access to the sub-station at the Limes and ask them to reinstate the area
    properly and to enquire when the sub-station building work would be completed.<br>
    <strong>Gate access to Upper Up</strong><br>
    The tail stock on the gate had been damaged and a new locking device would be needed. Cllr
    Harris offered to purchase a replacement and fit it. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and
    seconded by Cllr Dunn that the Parish Council agrees to reimburse his expenses and to pay
    up to £20 for his labour. With the exception of Cllr Harris who abstained the Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported on her inspections. Litter on all areas was her main observation
    although Cerney Wick play area was an exception. At Upper Up she noted that safety tiles
    were coming apart but did not yet present a hazard. The fence at Cerney Wick had not been
    repaired. Cllr Mrs Chapman volunteered to raise the matter once again with the Cerney Wick
    Village Hall Committee. Cllr Harris will carry out the next round of inspections.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris, Cllr King and Cllr Nicholas had met to discuss what future action could be
    taken on the project. Cllr Harris reported that Cllr Nicholas would contact Whitton
    Associates to see if a revised scheme could be devised. Due to CDC reducing its grant
    funding and the withdrawal of the favoured contractor the original scheme would be much
    more costly to complete. Cllr Nicholas suggested that there were two possible ways to
    proceed: (a) scale down the scheme with a more simple specification to implement the
    essence of it or (b) proceed with the original plan financing it by increasing the Precept
    next year. Cllr Stuart queried the necessity of Whitton Associates' involvement. It was
    the opinion of the Parish Council that their professional help was required.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish
    Council agrees to this request. The Parish Council was all in favour<br>
    16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDC ­ Fence and trees at Orchard House; copy letter to Ms Lloyd re
    lime tree<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee recommended that if the lime tree dies CDC should prosecute the
    owner<br>
    26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Harris Contracting ­ Quotation for work on The Piece<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Harris declared an interest and did not enter the debate. As only one
    quote had been received no decision was taken<br>
    27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Harris Contracting ­ Quotation for removal of cherry tree in
    Clarks Hay<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Harris declared an interest and did not enter the debate. One further
    verbal quote had been received which was lower than JH Contracting.<br>
    The Parish Council had earlier accepted the verbal quote from K. Richings to cut down the
    dead cherry tree to below ground level for £50.<br>
    28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ian Roberts ­ state of the Mill Stream (email)<br>
    33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT.CONTR 1316 ­ No objection<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Daffodil Bulbs</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the daffodil bulbs had been ordered and delivery was expected.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Officer Commanding 29 Regt RCT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that Col. Séan English had made it known that he would appreciate an
    invitation to attend a Parish Council meeting and meet with Parish Councillors. The Parish
    Council agreed to invite Col. English to attend either the November or December meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lakeside Railway Arches</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to write to residents of Lakeside pointing out that it was an
    offence to dump rubbish especially at the adjacent railway arches.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Anonymous Fly Posting</strong><br>
    A number of anonymous posters denigrating CDC had been noticed throughout the village. The
    Clerk had been informed by Mr M. Grace (Enforcement Officer) CDC that it was an offence to
    remove them without first ascertaining who had been responsible for putting them up. Once
    exhaustive inquiries had been made they could be removed. He suggested that a copy should
    be posted on the Parish Council's noticeboard and a note attached inviting the
    perpetrators to produce evidence for their accusations. The Parish Council disagreed with
    this suggestion as the content of the poster was libellous. Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk
    to enquire from Mr Grace which piece of legislation referred.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>The Old House, High Street</strong><br>
    Mr M. Grace would check whether a new velux window which had been installed in the roof of
    the property was contrary to planning regulations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Traffic Speed in Wildmoorway Lane</strong><br>
    Traffic, allegedly using Watermark facilities, was reported by Cllr Mrs Gardiner for
    speeding in Wildmoorway Lane. The Clerk was asked to write to the manager at Watermark to
    ask him to warn motorists using the facilities in the lane to reduce their speed on this
    unadopted road.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Riverway Skip</strong><br>
    Cllr Dunn requested that the Parish Council agrees to provide a skip for rubbish removal
    for a self help group in Riverway. It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr
    Stuart that a skip be provided for the Riverway group up to a maximum rent value of £75.
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>National Cycle Network Route 45</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas would liaise with Dr P. Stephenson on this matter.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Borehole Lease</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Dunn that before completion of the
    lease it should be ascertained that legal and surveyors fees had been paid. There was one
    literal mistake to be corrected on page 1. In Clause 3 the words (if demanded) should be
    deleted. Rent should be payable to the Parish Council by Standing Order. The Parish
    Council was all in favour. Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart and
    the Clerk Maurice McKee signed the document.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HM Land Registry</strong><br>
    A form for the transfer of the open space area at the Limes had been received but
    discrepancies were found in the document. In Clause 4 the word &quot;of&quot; had been
    repeated and should read &quot;part of the land&quot;. In Clause 8 the Clerk's old address
    had been used and should be updated.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong><br>
    Section 19 of the Act requires every public authority to adopt and maintain a publication
    scheme which has been approved by the Information Commissioner. Cllr Nicholas had designed
    a form listing the information held and where it could be accessed which the Clerk would
    forward to the Commissioner. The Clerk would maintain the register in a similar way to the
    Register of Members' Interests. Cllr Harris proposed a vote of thanks&nbsp; for Cllr
    Nicholas and the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
