    <td>A considerable number of parents, with their children attended. In view of this, prior
    to the start of the meeting, Cllr Stuart requested authority from the Parish Council to
    offer both the adults and youngsters a 10 minute slot to state their reason for attending.
    This was agreed. Their nominated spokesman, Mr Danny Stewart, said a rumour was
    circulating the village that the introduction of jumps had been abandoned at the Upper Ups
    and Downs. Cllr Harris said there had been a slight change to the construction design
    which was, in fact , superior and more interesting to the original plan. Cllr Nicholas
    said because the area would not be supervised and was quite a distance from the nearest
    habitation it had been difficult to get insurance cover and the whole idea had nearly been
    abandoned. Mr Stewart said the youngsters were not happy with the mountain bike area as,
    to gain maximum use for all ages, they would like a series of jumps. One youngster added
    that if these jumps were not available he could envisage that the mountain bike area would
    not be used and the money spent would be wasted. Cllr Nicholas added that the Parish
    Council was totally on the side of the youngsters and it was imperative that the mountain
    bike site suited all ages. After some further discussion Cllr Nicholas suggested that a
    site meeting is held attended by the youngsters, Cllr Harris and as many members of the
    Parish Council as possible. Any changes to the site would, of course, be dependent on
    finance. It was agreed to meet at the site on Saturday 14 June 2003 at 2.00 pm. Cllr
    Harris asked the youngsters to wait a while before using the site to give the grass seed
    time to grow. He also stressed that on no account were the youngsters to create an area of
    jumps on a self help basis - they would not be covered by insurance and it would be the
    duty of the Parish Council to level any area that was not built to an agreed
    specification. On behalf of those who attended Mr Stewart thanked the Parish Council for
    their time.<br>
    <br>
    The Parish Council meeting then commenced at 7.52 pm.<br>
    <br>
    Apologies were received from Councillor Baines (CDC). Cllr Stuart reported that Mr McKee
    was doing well and hoped to be back in harness for the next meeting. In his absence Anne
    Stuart had agreed to step in and do the minutes and a small amount of correspondence. All
    Councillors wished Mr McKee well.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Stuart welcomed Cllr Julian Caunce to the Council.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Jay proposed Cllr Pollard join the Planning Committee, seconded Cllr Smith. Carried
    unanimously.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING</strong><br>
    <br>
    The minutes of the previous meeting were taken as read and agreed.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Jubilee Gardens</strong><br>
    Cllr Clark reported that Jephsons had apologised for the way the contractors had left the
    site. They will return the site to an acceptable level on Monday 16 June 2003.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Ramp</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the barrier and concreting of the Upper Up ramp was now
    completed. Cllr Stuart said he had received a letter requesting that Highways be asked to
    place a drop curb on the corner immediately opposite the entrance to the playing field. He
    had spoken to Roger Summerell of the Highways Authority who said this was not acceptable.
    However it may be possible to place a drop curb further along the footpath where there was
    adequate visibility in both directions. It was agreed to write to Gloucestershire County
    Council to ask them to carry out a feasibility study and price for this work. In view of
    the work that needs to be carried out in the area of the car park to provide suitable
    access for disabled users arriving by car and on foot Cllr Stuart suggested we employ the
    services of a specialist architect. Cllr Jay said it was vital that before work is carried
    out on any project, be it for hundreds of pounds or 6.5p, a specialist in whatever field
    should always be consulted. After some discussion it was agreed that Cllr Stuart would
    contact Quattro Design and Roger Jarvis and request that their specialist architect survey
    the site and come back with their proposals. Cllr Stuart will also ask whoever is
    instructed to design the job to liaise with the Highways Authority.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Golf Balls</strong><br>
    To date Mr Franklin has still not erected a warning notice on the stile from Webb's field
    to the canal.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Flower Tubs</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman has still not been able to make contact with Mr M Chamberlain. Cllr
    Harris agreed to speak with Mr Tim Bailey regarding the bridle path at the bottom of the
    old railway line at the end of Station road where top soil has recently been laid. Cllr
    Harris said the area would become extremely muddy after heavy rainfall and it was agreed
    the Parish Council would write to BT requesting that the bridle path be reinstated with a
    suitable surface.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Park</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay said it must be borne in mind that any additions to the mountain bike area may
    require planning permission. Cllr Bennett added that if major changes were made to the
    original planning consent this may cause a problem in the future if anything was to go
    wrong. Cllr Clark said provided the changes were minor she felt there would not be a
    problem with planning. Cllr Jay said whatever is agreed the safety of the youngsters using
    the area must be paramount. Cllr Stuart asked as many persons as possible to attend the
    meeting on Saturday.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Aircraft Noise</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that at the Annual Parish Meeting the Marquis had given a
    presentation on aircraft noise. The meeting had been attended by two representatives from
    29 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps. It had proved to be a very useful meeting when a number
    of issues had been raised. The Silver Stars do adhere to the flying restrictions and
    flight patterns agreed, namely flying taking place between 1000-1900 hrs Monday to
    Saturday and 1000-1600 hrs on Sundays. Where possible, depending on the wind direction,
    care is taken not to fly over inhabited areas. However other users of the airfield do not
    have to follow these flight timings or flight patterns. The plane which raises the most
    complaints, the Sky Van, is used by the RAF and not the Silver Stars. A dialogue had been
    set up between the Marquis and the Army. Despite this, further complaints had been
    received regarding aircraft noise and at the Committee Meeting it was suggested that the
    Parish Council write to the Commanding Officer 29 Regiment RLC asking that a request is
    made through the chain of command to the other users of South Cerney airfield asking that
    they also comply with the flight restrictions accepted by the Silver Stars. Cllr Stuart
    read out the proposed letter. It was agreed that this is forwarded to the Commanding
    Officer as soon as possible. Cllr Webb concluded the discussion on aircraft noise by
    stating that very few people in the village find the aircraft noise a problem. The Parish
    Council was unanimous in stating their support for the Silver Stars. It was also felt that
    the Parish Council had done all they could with regard to aircraft noise and the matter
    would not be raised again at Council Meetings.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>QUALITY COUNCIL</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Jay and Cllr Pollard had attended a Training Meeting for new Parish Councillors when
    the subject of Quality Councils was discussed. The idea is to delegate more control to
    Parish Council and Cllr Jay informed the meeting that in Somerset some Quality Parish
    Councils have authority to make planning decisions. Cllr Stuart said he understands that
    unless the Parish Council obtains Control status it will not be as easy to obtain grants
    as it would if such qualification is obtained. Further discussion took place and Cllr
    Nicholas added a note of caution by stating that the Parish Council members would find it
    very difficult to take on yet more responsibilities which would seem inevitable if they
    obtained Quality status. Cllr Jay said if Regional Government moves away then it may be
    vital that Parish Councils have more authority. Cllr Stuart feels that Mr McKee had
    obtained all the necessary qualifications to enable us to apply for Quality status. Cllr
    Nicholas wished to register his profound reservations if the Parish Council obtained
    quality status. The discussion concluded by the Parish Council agreeing that Mr McKee
    applies for Quality status.<br>
