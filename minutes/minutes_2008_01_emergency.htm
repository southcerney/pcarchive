 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart who had earlier that afternoon called the emergency 
 meeting opened the meeting at 6.05pm.
 <p><b>APOLOGIES</b> </p>
 <p>Cllr Caunce and Cllr Mrs Land were unable to attend <br>
 The Chairman was unable to contact Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr 
 Mrs Tunbridge.</p>
 <p><b>ALLEVIATION OF POTENTIAL FLOOD RISK</b> </p>
 <p>Following the heavy rainfall during the previous Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, 
 Cllr Harris had drawn the Chairman’s attention to a serious problem at the 
 bridge over the river Churn near to the Robert Franklin Way play area. The 
 supporting arch was completely covered, and nearby properties along the bank 
 were in particular danger of flooding as the river was backing up. If this was 
 to happen, then more properties lying lower in Robert Franklin Way would also 
 be threatened, and the potential for serious damage was evident. The water 
 level at this point in the river was the highest for 25 years, and was possibly 
 due to work carried out to raise the height of the river bank further up. This 
 work had eased the flooding problem at the Upper Up end of the village, but the 
 effect was to increase the flow further down, and the bridge at Robert Franklin 
 Way was now acting as a dam, causing a back-up of water. Cllr Harris had 
 contacted the Environment Agency, which had no objection to a plan he devised – 
 to divert the overflow through a series of pipes under the old railway line 
 into a water meadow beyond. It would require a trench of 12 metres in length 
 and a series of six 300mm diameter pipes to carry the surplus water to relieve 
 the flow through the arch of the bridge. The Environment Agency ordered that 
 any work should not be closer than 8 metres from the river bank. Cllr Stuart 
 had been in contact with Gloucestershire County Council PROW which had no 
 objections either. Cllr Nicholas would inform the owner of the adjoining 
 meadow, Mr Franklin of Worms Farm, of the plan to ensure that he had no 
 objection. Due to the weather forecasts for the coming days heavy rain was 
 expected, which meant that the scheme must be implemented by Friday to avoid an 
 impending disaster. As Cllr Harris was available, the assembled Councillors 
 agreed he was more than suited for the task. As James Harris Contracting, he 
 was able to provide an estimate of £1,610 ex VAT. To comply with the Parish 
 Council’s Standing Orders, payment for the work would be approved in two 
 tranches. </p>
 <p>Cllr Harris then left the meeting while the remainder of the Parish Council 
 considered its options. </p>
 <p>It was proposed by Cllr Stuart, and seconded by Cllr Walker, that the Parish 
 Council agrees to this necessary work by James Harris Contracting. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p>Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 6.50pm.</td>
