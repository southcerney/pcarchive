    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 8th DECEMBER 2004</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when Vice Chairman, Cllr T. Squire 
    welcomed Police Sergeant Steve Templeton to the meeting. Sgt Templeton had 
    prepared a table of crime figures for South Cerney which compared those in 
    period April–November 2003 with a similar period in 2004. Overall detection 
    performance had fallen by 2% but interestingly there were no robberies 
    reported in either period. In reply to a question from Cllr Jay who asked 
    who was mostly responsible for crime in the area he said that in his opinion 
    18–24 year olds made up the majority of those apprehended at Stroud police 
    station. He confirmed that Police and Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) 
    had on occasions diverted through South Cerney on their way to and from 
    Fairford/Cirencester. Police had attended incidences in the area of the 
    telephone kiosk in High Street after complaints from nearby residents. Cllr 
    Jay complained about the length of time it had taken to remove an abandoned 
    car in Clarks Hay. The Sergeant explained that action could be taken only if 
    the vehicle was not taxed and no contact with the registered keeper 
    possible. In all cases the best way to contact Cirencester Police Station 
    was to ring 0845 090 1234 and ask the operator for Cirencester. Cllr Squire 
    said that during the summer youngsters were misbehaving on the Upper Up 
    playing fields and recently unauthorised fires had been started. Cllr 
    Nicholas said that broken glass was a continual problem. Sgt Templeton said 
    that if such incidences, especially the starting of fires, were reported 
    then Police would certainly react. He would pass on Parish Councillors 
    concerns’ to PCSO Clive Wilks and PCSO Ron Smith and ask them to patrol the 
    area. Cllr Squire complained about vehicles which were parked on kerbs, 
    especially outside the Londis in Broadway Lane. The Sergeant explained that 
    unless these vehicles were reported as causing an obstruction no action 
    would be taken unless a passing patrol noticed. Sgt Templeton agreed with 
    Cllr Nicholas who complained that there was a lack of communication and 
    liaison between GCC County Highways and the Police. The Clerk remarked that 
    County Highways were reluctant to consider altering the speed limits on 
    Cirencester Road/Preston Toll Bar because the police would not enforce the 
    limit. Sgt Templeton advised Parish Councillors to contact Sgt Chris 
    Rawlings who specialised in traffic related problems at Cirencester. Cllr 
    Harris asked the Police to use its influence to persuade hauliers to wash 
    the wheels of their vehicles if necessary before accessing local 
    carriageways and depositing mud and soil thereon. Cllr Squire thanked Sgt 
    Templeton for attending the meeting and the Sergeant left at 7.30pm.</p>

    The Vice Chairman, Cllr Squire opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had apologised for his absence due to a family engagement.<br>

    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    in favour. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Pollard, Cllr Squire and Cllr Webb 
    abstained. Vice Chairman Cllr Squire signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Council Tax</b><br>
    Cllr Baines (CDC) explained that second homes in the area had no effect on 
    the precept. The extra income produced through the reduction in discount 
    from 50% to 10% would be for the benefit of the District Council, County 
    Council and the Police.<br>
    <b>Wheel Washing</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had ascertained that no Condition to enforce wheel 
    washing had been included in the granted permission for the activities on 
    Lake 11. Nevertheless, there was a wheel wash being used on the site, the 
    specification of which would be in excess of any Condition which might have 
    been imposed. Vehicles using the site had two exit options one of which did 
    not wash wheels and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would pursue a means of having the 
    wheels of all vehicles washed before leaving the site by whichever exit. The 
    Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Harris that the Clerk write 
    to the Police and County Highways pointing out the hazardous conditions 
    being created by these vehicle movements and copy the letter to Cllr S. 
    Parsons (GCC) and Tim Pain, Chief Executive Officer at the <b>Cotswold Water 
    Park Society.</b><br>
    <b>Flooding Report</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) noted that Thames Water plc were particularly active in 
    the village monitoring the condition of the sewerage system. There would be 
    more to report in January after the next Flood Forum had met. At its meeting 
    the Village Maintenance and Playing Field Committee recommended that the 
    Flooding Report should be an agenda item in January. The Parish Council 
    agreed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Saturday 13th November I attended the official opening of the 
    refurbishment of Robert Franklin Way play area. Although bitterly cold about 
    75 others were also there. Cllr Mrs Shirley Alexander (CDC) Chairman of the 
    Grants Committee and Cllr Mrs Anne Clark (CDC) cut the tapes and declared 
    the playing field open. The Chairman Cllr Michael Stuart presented both 
    ladies with a bouquet of flowers.<br>
    On Tuesday 16th I met up with Cllr Stuart, Cllr Jay and Melanie Tarrant (GRCC) 
    at the Village Hall to discuss the plans for the next stage of the Village 
    Plan. The ideas collected were categorised and Cllr Stuart would ask Cllr 
    Mrs Pollard if she would prepare the information for presentation. I have 
    invited Dr Stephenson and Mr Steven Walker to join the sub committee. Dr 
    Stephenson has replied positively and I will contact him in due course.<br>
    On 3rd December I attended a meeting of the SLCC at Minchinhampton Golf 
    Club. There I made contact with Ms Hester Oxford who is an Area Partnership 
    Officer at GCC. One of her current tasks is to produce a Parish Charter to 
    define roles, responsibilities and decision making between Parish, District 
    and County Councils. I found the lecture informative and invited Ms Oxford 
    to make a presentation to Parish Councillors in March by which time she will 
    have concluded meetings with District and County Councillors.<br>
    Phil Cluely GCC PROW had told me today that notices informing the public 
    that the bridge would be closed on Friday 10th December. Work would start on 
    Monday 13th December.<br>
    During the month of November I averaged 3 hrs 20 mins per available working 
    day which is within the terms of my contract.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire delegated this section to Cllr Harris who agreed to report on 
    the deliberations of the committee which had met on Monday 6th December.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Zebra Crossing/Traffic Speed</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that Mr Whittaker had informed him by telephone that the 
    letters had been received and he would make a reply in due course.<br>
    <b>Flooding Report</b><br>
    The Committee agreed with Cllr Harris who suggested that this item be put on 
    the main agenda in January. Engineers had been seen inspecting manhole 
    covers throughout the village in the previous weeks.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris was adamant that he had produced research on the safety surface 
    recommended by George Taylor from The Play Service although neither Cllr 
    Stuart nor the Clerk could remember having sight of it. Nevertheless Cllr 
    Harris would ask Mr Taylor for a copy of the email and if any past customers 
    were prepared to give a testimonial on the use of the safety surface. The 
    Clerk would ask Mr Taylor to quote to replace the safety surfaces at all 
    three play areas. Cllr Stuart volunteered to liaise with Mr Taylor if 
    requested.<br>
    <b>Tree Planting Scheme</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that he had received some 14 enquiries about the scheme 
    from residents. He had recorded each requirement on file until actual costs 
    can be ascertained. Gordon Stratford will inform Cllr Stuart on plaques and 
    engraving costs.<br>
    <b>Public Seat</b><br>
    R.O.W. Berry had requested that the siting of the seat which had been agreed 
    in Clarks Hay be moved to High Street to the left of the telephone box when 
    viewed from the carriageway. The Committee was not in favour as the area in 
    the vicinity of the telephone box was a rallying point for some youths who 
    had caused distress to residents in that area. It was felt that if a seat 
    was to be positioned there, it might well encourage more of this behaviour. 
    Further, the area was very well provided for with public seats at the War 
    Memorial, the Cross, the Limes, Station Road bus stop and the main bus stop. 
    The Committee recommended that the Parish Council agreed to the original 
    position where there is a need for such a seat opposite the Fish &amp; Chip shop 
    at the entrance to the Laurels. The Parish Council agreed and added that 
    provision for a litter bin is made when the base was being laid. The Clerk 
    was to ask CDC if a bin could be installed.<br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs</b><br>
    The Clerk had been reliably informed that Ged Cassell (CDC) had access to 
    grant funding for the installation of interactive speed signs. Cllr Squire 
    had volunteered to enquire on the criteria necessary to achieve such 
    funding.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that all equipment was in working order. The Clerk was 
    asked to obtain quotations to scrape and fill in the holes in the car park. 
    A resident had informed Cllr Stuart that unauthorised fires were being lit 
    near to the tennis and cricket pavilions and asked that the Police be 
    informed at the meeting on Wednesday. Cllr Stuart made his apology for not 
    being able to attend on Wednesday because of a pre-arranged family matter. 
    He explained that there were broken pallets partly hidden under the conifer 
    hedge which should be moved but they were too large for Mr Curtis to handle. 
    Cllr Stuart had moved this material. Cllr Stuart reported on a visit he had 
    made to the Upper Up playing field on a Saturday morning at the request of 
    Gordon Stratford from South Cerney Football Club. In excess of 40 children 
    and youths, of both sexes, in the age range from 8 to 14 were using the 
    facilities and it was evident that there was an urgent need for another 
    small soccer pitch. Cllr Stuart recommended that the Parish Council gives 
    immediate approval to the Football Club to enlarge their field to 
    accommodate the growing numbers using the playing field. The Committee was 
    in agreement. Cllr Jay said that the Parish Council should encourage youth 
    by every means and proposed that the Football Club be permitted to use 
    further areas, as agreed. Cllr Caunce seconded the motion and the Parish 
    Council was all in favour. The Clerk would inform Mr Stratford.<br>
    Robert Franklin Way play area<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in working order. Grass between 
    the goal posts was beginning to wear out. Over growing shrubs on Ash Moon 
    boundary had still not been cut back and the barrier was not yet repaired. 
    The Committee agreed that a letter be sent to Tim Pain, Chief Executive 
    Officer at the Cotswold Water Park informing him of the outstanding work and 
    a copy sent to Malcolm Watt (CDC) on the Water Park Joint Committee. The 
    Clerk was asked to check the date of the GCC Bridge Survey and the results 
    thereof. The Clerk was asked to report a motorbike which had been dumped in 
    the bushes at the northern entrance to Robert Franklin Way playing field. 
    Cllr Harris had produced a specification for the repair of the chain link 
    fence at Robert Franklin Way playing field.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that there were no problems at the playing field in 
    Cerney Wick and would fax the report to the Clerk in due course.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Tree Survey</b><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb agreed to carry out a tree survey in the New Year 
    during January.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Water Park Briefing Notes</b><br>
    Tim Pain had forwarded briefing notes about sensitive issues in the Water 
    Park which could be used to answer questions put to Parish Councillors by 
    the general public, the press or other local councillors. The Clerk had 
    emailed a copy to all Parish Councillors. Cllr Jay did not approve of the 
    wording of the fourth item where Mr Pain had alleged that pensioners were 
    responsible for the industrial-scale bird feeding at Lakeside. He suggested 
    that Parish Councillors describe these people as those of an indeterminate 
    age.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Sheep Worrying</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb declared an interest as owner of the sheep and left the room.<br>
    It had been reported that dogs were worrying sheep in the field between the 
    back of the Old George public house and Box Bush and also in the paddock at 
    the rear of Huxley Court. Three sheep had been lost in the last six weeks 
    one of which was a large Cotswold ram. Cllr Mrs Chubb had asked that dog 
    owners be made aware through the Cerney News. The Committee was in full 
    agreement.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb rejoined the debate.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Canal Footpath</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the refurbishment of the footpath from Northmoor 
    Lane to Bow Wow is currently being costed and the specification finalised 
    although approval from the land owner will be necessary before the project 
    can start.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Flooding of footpath under bridge at Spine Road</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported to the GCC PROW that the footpath under the bridge at 
    the Spine Road was flooded. PROW would inspect the problem.<br>
    <br>
    <b>General</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart brought the following on-going unresolved items to the attention 
    of Mr Barton.<br>
    1. The cycle path on the old railway line to Siddington/Cirencester, 2. The 
    footpath from Upper Up to Keynes Park, 3. Wildmoorway Lane BSC20.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Smith reported on the deliberations of this committee which had met on 
    Monday 6th December.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Cutts Charity</b><br>
    Cllr Jay declared a prejudicial interest as Clerk to the Cutts Charity and 
    after explaining how the Cutts Charity Fund was allocated, left the room.<br>
    Cllr Jay had previously informed the Committee that income from the Cutts 
    Charity which would total £260 approximately is divided equally between the 
    Church, Parish Council and the poor. If the Parish Council refused to accept 
    its portion then the amount given to the poor could be doubled. The 
    Committee recommends that the Parish Council decides to decline the donation 
    offered through the Cutts Charity. It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded 
    by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the Parish Council declines the donation from Cutts 
    Charity. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Jay rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Outstanding</b><br>
    R. Hewer Notice board repair £165.00<br>
    <br>
    <b>Receipts</b><br>
    R. Hewer Part payment for notice board repair £40.00<br>
    <br>
    <b>Payments Out</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a payee and left the room.<br>

    Petty Cash Litter Picking (December) £100.00<br>
    M. McKee Clerk’s Travel (November) £58.08<br>

    Busy Fingers Photocopying £28.86<br>
    Rodney Gardiner Ground maintenance at Cerney Wick (November) £38.55<br>
    <b>£1,752.89</b><br>
    Cllr Smith had previously inspected and agreed the Clerk’s travel expenses 
    for November.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was in favour.<br>
    Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Precept Meeting</b><br>
    The Committee agreed to meet on Tuesday 4th January 2005 at the Old Police 
    House at 7.30pm to finalise its budget proposals. It is essential that CDC 
    is notified of the required precept for the year commencing 1st April 2005 
    not later than 28th January 2005. The local tax base for 2005 is 1334.3 
    compared to 2004 at 1326.3, 2003 at 1311.1, 2002 at 1290.9 and 2001 at 
    1277.6<br>
    <br>
    <b>Play Group Grant</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman declared a prejudicial interest as a Trustee of the Play 
    Group and left the meeting. Cllr Nicholas also declared a prejudicial 
    interest as he was acting on behalf of the Trustees of the Play Group on its 
    lease and left the room. It was agreed that there should be a consensus 
    within the Council as to how much of a grant should be recommended. A debate 
    ensued and Cllr Smith proposed that the full entitlement available under 
    Section 137 should be precepted for all charitable purposes. As explained in 
    last month’s Minutes this would amount to approximately £12,500 based on 
    2,454 electors at £5.15 per elector. The Committee had agreed to this 
    proposal and recommended that the Parish Council did likewise. Cllr Jay 
    suggested that a substantial donation of £5,000 might be considered. Cllr 
    Webb was concerned that if the donation was made it might create a 
    precedent. Cllr Smith argued that every subsequent case would be treated on 
    its merits in the same way as the request from the Play Group was being 
    discussed. Cllr Caunce proposed and Cllr Harris seconded a motion that the 
    Parish Council was minded to make a donation of £5,000 to the Play Group.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman and Cllr Nicholas rejoined the debate. The Parish Council 
    was aware that potentially £12,500 was available under Section 137 for 
    projects which would benefit the community.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on Monday 6th December.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Wheel Washing</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform A. R. Jones (CDC) how dismayed the Parish 
    Council was that no Condition enforcing wheel washing was issued when 
    permission was granted for the operation currently being undertaken at Lake 
    11, Jet Ski lake on Cerney Wick Lane.<br>
    <b>Letter to A. R. Jones (CDC)</b><br>
    No reply had been received to the letter querying how the Parish Council 
    could determine applications when decisions on nature, texture and colour of 
    materials to be used is unknown.<br>
    <b>Jubilee Gardens Public Art</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the Parish Council that under a Section 106 
    Agreement £11,600 had been set aside for public art and a grant of £8,573 
    from the Gloucestershire Environment Trust had been approved verbally making 
    just over £20,000 in total. Work on the project was programmed for early 
    next Spring, probably in March or April. Ground maintenance of the area 
    could be carried out by CDC on a monthly basis or the Parish Council might 
    add it to its grass cutting schedule but there would be no cash incentive 
    available from Fosseway or CDC for this purpose as no profit had been made 
    on the sale of the land which had been used for the provision of social 
    housing. The Chairman brought the debate to an end stating that the 
    maintenance negotiations could take place at a later date.<br>
    Aggregate Industries<br>
    The Clerk reported that he had asked Michael Grace (CDC Enforcement Officer) 
    for clarification of the planning conditions imposed regarding work starting 
    times and his reply was awaited. Cllr Squire was in close contact with Mr 
    Brassington (CDC Environment) on this issue.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1865/H</b><br>
    Applicants: Mr &amp; Mrs Mullock, 4 The Paddock, South Cerney<br>
    Minor amendment to conservatory design at 4 The Paddock, High Street, South 
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2380/2/Y</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest as a personal friend of the applicant and 
    left the room.<br>
    Applicant: c/o Mr S. Cole, Cotswold Angling, Wyevale Garden Centre, Hyde 
    Road, Kingsdown, Swindon SN2 7SE<br>
    Erection of single Class A1 unit, with parking, delivery access and 
    landscape works at Lake 19, Broadway Lane, South Cerney<br>
    The Committee decided that as this site was not in an existing industrial 
    zone the development would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the area. 
    A debate ensued culminating in a proposal from Cllr Caunce and seconded by 
    Cllr Smith that the Parish Council has no objection to the development. The 
    motion was carried on a majority vote. One member of the Parish Council 
    voted to object.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2443/P</b><br>
    Amended Plans – Construction of 24 dwellings and associated works at land at 
    63–80 Berkeley Close, South Cerney<br>
    Cllr Harris agreed with Cllr Nicholas who noted that only 23 dwellings were 
    on the plan.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas argued that as the plan proposed to build on a play area, 
    technically it was a change of use from play area to residential development 
    and as no replacement play area was noted it was a valid reason for 
    objecting. The Parish Council was prepared to accept the decision of the 
    Housing Strategy at CDC that four of the 24 dwellings are affordable housing 
    and not the 40% originally suggested by the Parish Council. The Parish 
    Council agreed with the content of a letter from A. R. Jones (CDC Head of 
    Planning) to Geoffrey Clifton Brown MP that permission should not be granted 
    until the factors that led to the flooding problems a few years ago be shown 
    to have been fully examined and resolved. Indeed, it is to be hoped that the 
    re-development itself will be the catalyst to ensure that these issues are 
    permanently resolved. Cllr Harris noted that there was no fence to the south 
    side of the development on the plan which he considered was necessary to 
    protect the play area at the side of the adjacent Scout Hut. Concern was 
    expressed with the traffic management arrangement in Berkeley Close. 
    Further, more ground water will be forced into the sewerage system through 
    water running off the parking lots. Disappointment was expressed that there 
    was no mention of the type of materials to be used.<br>

    15, Spine Road, South Cerney<br>
    As the Committee could not agree on a recommendation it was proposed not to 
    object by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard. The motion was carried 
    by 5 to 1 with Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Squire

    The Committee recommended that the previous objections are repeated and to 
    include that it is of the opinion that the cycle store is inadequate. Before 
    any final decision can be taken by the Parish Council answers to the 
    following questions are requested: 1. What is the type and source of the 
    natural stone to be used? 2. What is the type and colour of the 
    reconstituted or natural roof tiles?<br>
    3. What is the type, colour and finish of the cladding material to be used? 
    If permission is granted the Parish Council recommends that all power lines 
    will be underground. Further, any external lights should be of a design to 
    achieve optimal reduction of light pollution; all signage to be kept to a 
    minimum and subject to separate detailed planning approval; Section 106 
    contributions to include an all weather enclosed play area in South Cerney, 
    a substantial contribution to play areas in both Cerney Wick and South 
    Cerney, a contribution to upgrade the SUSTRANS Route 45 and a contribution 
    to the Building and Monument Fund of the Parish Council.<br>
    Although the Parish Council has objected to the development until further 
    details are provided it has no objection in principle to this design of 
    development.<br>

    The Committee is concerned that noise levels are not thought to be an issue 
    as stated in paragraph A2.23 (i) and (ii) especially as the prevailing wind 
    is towards South Cerney. Anticipated increased traffic movements will 
    seriously add to road deterioration in the area.<br>

    With the exception of CT.2380/2/Y and CT4073/H which had previously been

    application was considered by the Parish Council at its meeting in September

    <b>PARISH COUNCILLORS PORTFOLIOS</b><br>
    At the SLCC Annual Conference a suggestion that Parish Councillors might be 
    responsible for various portfolios was thought to be a way in which to 
    involve Parish Councillors more closely with their Parish Council. At its 
    meeting in November Parish Councillors were minded that this idea might be 
    worthwhile. Consequently members of the Parish Council discussed what those 
    portfolios might be. The Chairmen of the three committees would continue to 
    be responsible for all matters concerning each of their committees and 
    matters concerning trees would be the responsibility of the tree wardens. 
    Other portfolios suggested were Water Park, Village Plan, liaising with 
    neighbouring parishes including those in Wiltshire, school governor, public 
    transport and roads, flood and snow, village hall, aged and youth. The Clerk 
    was asked to put this item on the agenda for January for further discussion.<br>
