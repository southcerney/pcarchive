 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 7th JANUARY 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr 
 Harris that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Cllr Caunce and Cllr 
 Kimberley both abstained as neither had been present at the meeting. The 
 remainder of the Parish Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the 
 minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Jasmin Tresadern attended the meeting on behalf of the 
 Youth Parish Council. Sinead Peare and Joe Lodge were busy studying for their 
 ‘A’ level examinations. It was suggested to Jasmin that she encourages 
 Charlotte Tickle to be come more involved with the group. The Clerk informed 
 her that the Silver Stars had agreed to make a display jump to the Upper Up 
 playing fields to open the new facilities. The parachute team would perform 
 either on the 18th or 19th April. The precise date and time will be notified 
 later. Cllr Caunce enquired if the YPC would like to have lines painted on the 
 basketball side of the MUGA now that the hoop had been positioned on the other 
 side of the wall. Cllr Harris asked if the YPC had decided on what they would 
 like done with the old basketball area. Jasmin expressed an interest in the 
 tree competition sponsored by CDC. The Clerk will forward her the details.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris will enquire from Ian Kennedy if there has 
 been any progress with his endeavours to liaise with his superiors in the Scout 
 movement regarding the future of the Scout Hut in Berkeley Close. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that the drain grille in the open ditch 
 in Station Road had eventually been cleared by Gloucestershire Highways and in 
 his estimation, just in time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that Amanda Keys from GCC PROW 
 informed him that a Public Enquiry to determine the application of the pathway 
 known as the Barracks path would be held in the Village Hall on the 16th and 
 17th July.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 29th January I attended a meeting in the 
 Village Hall to discuss draft proposals from the Parish Council to the Local 
 Development Framework (LDF) Settlement Strategy for South Cerney and Cerney 
 Wick. Cllr Nicholas chaired the meeting. Also present were Cllr Harris, Cllr 
 Jay, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge. Cllr Mrs Land had sent an apology for 
 her absence as she had been unwell. The meeting started at 7.30pm. Cllr 
 Nicholas had prepared a document outlining issues which had been identified in 
 the parish and the group proceeded to discuss and analyse how best to promote 
 or downgrade their relevance. There was a consensus that small infill 
 development was preferable to large developments. Green lungs should be 
 preserved if at all possible to create the feeling of spaciousness which was a 
 feature of the present village. If possible, car parking was a priority but 
 creating space for such a scheme would be difficult. Cycle routes along the 
 canal and/or the disused railway line should be an objective. The Conservation 
 Area throughout the village should be preserved and if possible parts of it 
 even upgraded especially in the environs of the river Churn, Silver Street and 
 Clarks Hay areas. The removal of overhead cabling and retention of the open 
 ditch in Station Road were added to the wish list. A centre capable of 
 providing facilities for the village youth should also be considered a 
 priority. Cerney Wick should be left as it is as the infrastructure and access 
 were not capable of supporting further development. Access to the Water Park 
 for residents and visitors alike should be improved. Further increases in the 
 number of second homes should be resisted. Overall the parish could be divided 
 into four separate regions: 1. the village proper; 2. Cerney Wick; 3. holiday 
 homes; 4. the army camp. Cllr Nicholas had closed the meeting at 9.40pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">While delivering correspondence this afternoon I spoke 
 with Cllr Webb who told me that his treatment was progressing and there were 
 positive signs to report. Parish Councillors wanted it to be known that they 
 all wished him well and a quick recovery. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During January of the 21 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours 42 minutes per day which is par for my contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart, on behalf of the Parish Council, thanked Cllr 
 Nicholas for his work to date on the compilation of the response to the LDF 
 project. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Tunbridge that 
 the Parish Council was content to allow Cllr Nicholas to complete the return to 
 the CDC on its behalf. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE 
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 2nd FEBRUARY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr 
 Caunce had opened the meeting at 7.05pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Acknowledgement</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had thanked Cllr Stuart for deputising for him during his recent 
 absence. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Selection of Committee Member</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that Cllr 
 Kimberley joins the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields Committee. The 
 Committee was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Certification of MUGA.</b> £2,000 had been withheld 
 from Park Leisure’s account until the remedial work had been completed. Current 
 weather conditions prevented any action. Park Leisure was not conducive to 
 painting lines on the basketball side of the dividing wall. When the job had 
 been completed satisfactorily the remaining payment would be made and the 
 Completion Certificate presented to Rosemary Lynn (CDC) for accreditation by 
 the BLF (Big Lottery Fund). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2501 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards.</b> Two 
 quotations had now been received although other builders may be interested if 
 an architect’s design was available. The original specification, decided by the 
 Committee, had requested builders to supply a design and build quotation. Cllr 
 Mrs Chubb had enquired from Garrick Outdoor, the preferred bespoke supplier, 
 the dimensions of the concrete base needed to erect a 3-bay shelter. In 
 response to an enquiry from Cllr Kimberley, Cllr Mrs Chubb informed him that a 
 replacement glass panel would cost approximately £95.00 although there will be 
 a mileage charge to add for its installation. Garrick Outdoor had recommended 
 that the shelter be erected in the first place and then the concrete base 
 installed thereafter. Further discussion ensued on the merits or otherwise of 
 providing an architect’s design to encourage further quotations. Cllr Stuart 
 drew the discussion to a close by asking for a show of hands from assembled 
 councillors as to who was in favour of a brick shelter or a prefabricated one. 
 Seven were in favour of a prefabricated shelter and one preferred a stone 
 structure. Cllr Harris abstained. It was therefore agreed that the Parish 
 Council favoured a prefabricated shelter. The Clerk was instructed to ask for 
 quotations for a concrete base 2.5m x 1.7m. Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 for all her efforts with this project.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2501 – <b>“Shorncote Link”.</b> Cllr Stuart had a 
 further meeting with Mike Barton and Ms Sarah MacDonald (PROW officer GCC) to 
 discuss the diversion of the footpath on Mrs Ruth Berry’s land alongside the 
 hedge adjacent to the football pitches. No problems, except cost, were 
 perceived with this plan or to adopting the Parish Council’s permissive path as 
 a PROW. Costs could be ameliorated if other schemes in the area could be 
 “piggy-backed”. Cllr Stuart had contacted Stuart Milsom (MAI) and asked him to 
 have Thames Water agents Bruton Knowles confirm that the path will be made 
 good. Ali Swainston (Cotswold Water Park) and his team had started work on the 
 Somerford Keynes end of the path. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that Steve Hanson from the Payback in 
 the Community team was back in circulation. His work schedule included the 
 refurbishment of the steps down from Bow Wow to the old railway line. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Gloucestershire County Council PROW contractors would be 
 starting work on the ditches and drainage of Wildmoorway Lane which will take 
 several seasons to complete. Eventually a triangular path would be created and 
 the missing link provided from Lakeside car park to link up with the disused 
 railway line and bridle path to the outskirts of the village, hopefully with 
 the cooperation of Gloucestershire Highways. It was planned to make the pathway 
 user friendly for all types of perambulators and wheelchairs.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr Mrs Chapman for carrying out the inspections during 
 his recent absence. The leaves would be removed when the current conditions 
 permitted.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections and there 
 was nothing further to report.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had carried out the inspections and there was nothing untoward to 
 report. Due to weather conditions the entire area had been little used over the 
 past month.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that one of the selected contractors 
 had declined interest in the work. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded 
 by Cllr Jay that Adrian Gibbs be appointed as ground maintenance contractor for 
 the next two years. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As remedial work remains uncompleted the Parish Council 
 should continue to withhold the final tranche owed to Park Leisure Ltd. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 two items as a potential contractor and had left the committee room. <br>
 Quotations for the maintenance work on Robert Franklin Way were analysed. It 
 had been proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the 
 Committee recommends the quote from R.O.B. Berry. The Committee was in 
 agreement. Two quotations for the hedging work at Upper Up had been received. 
 The Committee recommended that the quotation from James Harris Contracting be 
 accepted by the Finance Committee. <br>
 Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommended that the Finance Committee 
 agrees to appointing John Hicks as the safety inspector of the play areas and 
 associated equipment in the parish. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee asked the Clerk to inform the Finance 
 Committee that it had agreed to replace two memorial trees which had been 
 damaged on the Upper Up playing field. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PREPARATIONS FOR GRAND OPENING OF FACILITIES ON UPPER 
 UP PLAYING FIELDS </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that he had arranged with the Silver 
 Stars to make a display parachute jump on to the Upper Up playing fields. The 
 secretary would confirm at a later date either Saturday 18th or Sunday 19th 
 April. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Kimberley, Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Stuart volunteered 
 to serve on a sub committee to plan the arrangements. Cllr Bennett (CDC) 
 volunteered as requested to join the team. A timetable of events and an 
 invitation list of contributors would need to be drawn up.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb on behalf of the Brownies requested 
 permission to plant about 30 trees on the Upper Up play area. The Committee had 
 no objection. Cllr Mrs Chubb accepted a generous offer from Cllr Harris of a 
 further pack of trees he would like to donate. Cllr Stuart also offered a 
 selection of trees to the scheme. Cllr Harris and Cllr Kimberley will inspect 
 the play area and make a recommendation as to where would be the most suitable 
 location for the planting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris proposed that the YPC should be asked if it 
 would like lines painted on the basketball side of the dividing wall on the 
 MUGA area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris invited Cllr Mrs Chubb to manage the 
 competition from The Cotswold Tree Warden Group which intends to create a 
 record of noteworthy trees and tree projects in Cotswold District. It is aimed 
 to do this through an inter-parish competition, which is hoped every parish 
 will enter. The large number of classes means that no parish is disadvantaged. 
 It is planned to publish a map showing all parishes which participate (and any 
 that don’t!). If photos are good enough and funding available, the Tree Warden 
 group should like to produce a more permanent record of the Cotswold tree scape 
 for the general public. Entries will be co-ordinated by your Tree Warden or 
 another person with an interest in trees appointed by the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired when the Traffic Committee would meet 
 again. He was concerned that nothing seemed to be happening since it was last 
 discussed. Cllr Nicholas informed him that Cllr Mrs Tunbridge, Cllr Stuart and 
 himself plus other members of the community were part of the Committee. The 
 Clerk was asked to coordinate a convenient time for a meeting with the various 
 members. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that one of the sliding locking devices 
 on the enclosed panel of the notice board in Clarks Hay had been broken. It was 
 agreed that he should ask R.O.B. Berry to inspect to see if it could be 
 repaired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to make a further enquiry from the 
 lighting department at GCC if low level lighting could be installed in the area 
 of the wooden bridge in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A letter from Mr P. Genillard regarding fallen tree débris 
 from Poplars in Bow Wow was discussed. It was agreed that the Clerk reply 
 stating that the Parish Council was saddened that both the Gloucestershire 
 Highways and the Environment Agency were disinclined to take responsibility for 
 the unstable trees. It may be possible that the Payback in the Community team 
 might provide the labour to remove the tops of the trees which had fallen into 
 his garden . The Parish Council will provide an introduction if Mr Genillard so 
 wishes. Cllr Nicholas has submitted a search to the Land Registry in an effort 
 to determine ownership of the land. Cllr Nicholas stated that the Parish 
 Council would be unable to set a precedent by taking on responsibility for the 
 trees. Cllr Parsons (GCC) will contact Gloucestershire Highways regarding the 
 safety of the remaining trees. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was also asked to write to Lady Fanshawe to 
 enquire the sections of the river Churn to which she claimed the riparian 
 rights. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce closed the 
 meeting at 8.44pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY
 2nd FEBRUARY 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Nicholas attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.45pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb had made an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spreadsheet Analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay noted that with two months of the period left, the expenditure 
 detailed on the spread sheet was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As remedial work remains uncompleted the Parish Council 
 should continue to withhold the final tranche owed to Park Leisure Ltd. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 two items and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After analysing quotations for the maintenance work on 
 Robert Franklin Way the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance agrees to the lowest quote which had been given by 
 R.O.B. Berry. At the Parish Council meeting it was proposed by Cllr Caunce and 
 seconded by Cllr Jay that R.O.B. Berry should be contracted to do the above 
 work. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the time of the meeting two quotations for the hedging 
 work at Upper Up had been received and Cllr Nicholas’ advice was to wait until 
 the Parish Council met on Wednesday to make a decision had been agreed. A 
 further quotation had been received since the meeting on Monday but all 
 exceeded that of James Harris Contracting. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and 
 seconded by Cllr Mrs Land that James Harris Contracting should be given the 
 contract to reduce the hedging at Upper Up playing in accordance with the 
 specifications supplied. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommended that the Finance Committee 
 agrees to appointing John Hicks as the safety inspector of the play areas and 
 associated equipment in the parish. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee asked the Clerk to inform the Finance 
 Committee that it had agreed to replace two memorial trees which had been 
 damaged on the Upper Up playing field. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee was in agreement with all the 
 recommendations.</p>

 This is not sustainable development. If CDC grants consent for the mobile home 
 and the caravan to remain, this would set a precedent for other such seasonal 
 workers’ accommodation, perhaps in more conspicuous locations. The Parish 
 Council suggests that any permission to be temporary only – say for 2/3 years – 
 whilst the applicants find a more sustainable solution to their problem. <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart had attended a seminar hosted by 
 the Canals Trust at the Gateway Centre. Of primary interest was the possibility 
 of the restoration of paths and cycle routes along the canal. The next meeting 
 was scheduled for June. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay proudly pronounced that he had taken part in the 
 Zero Waste Week and achieved a total of 114 grams. The savings in waste was 
 more than compensated by the increase in expense of providing goods from 
 specialists. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce was concerned with the reduction of the waste 
 collection service due to the weather conditions. He asked Cllr Bennett (CDC) 
 for an assurance that the contractors would accept ‘top hatting’ when the 
 collections returned to normal. Cllr Bennett (CDC) was unable to comply with 
 that request as SITA were, as he put it, “a law unto themselves”.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce remarked that the salt piles had not been 
 replenished. Cllr Parsons (GCC) informed the meeting that the government had 
 requisitioned the county’s supplies. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that yet another vehicle accident had 
 taken place at the junction of Cerney Wick Lane and the Spine Road and why 
 could something not be done to improve the safety at the junction. Cllr Parsons 
 (GCC) stated that all junctions in Gloucestershire were objectively prioritised 
 and all schemes must await promotion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce noted that there were lights showing in a 
 property on Waters Edge which he presumed meant that the property was occupied 
 in a supposedly closed season. Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated that some owners had 
 challenged the ruling of occupancy in the courts but the CDC had won its case. 
 There was one officer on full time duty checking that the conditions were being 
 obeyed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley complained that the bollards on the Spine 
 Road at the Wickwater Lane/Spine Road/Broadway Lane and Station Road/Cerney 
 Wick Lane/Spine Road were obscured with mud from passing vehicles and were now 
 unreadable. The Clerk will report his observations to Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that GCC had contacted him as Snow 
 Warden for the parish. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported on the Police Consultative Meeting he 
 had attended in the Village Hall. He stated that due to the nature of the 
 assembly the meeting was not constructive. Cllr Stuart complained to that PCSO 
 Dan Sinclair and PCSO Michael Owen had not co-ordinated the meetings 
 satisfactorily. Cllr Stuart remarked that Sgt McIntyre who is in charge of 
 PCSOs at Cirencester spends too much of his time as Custody Sergeant at Stroud 
 Police Station. Consequently there is a lack of direction of the PCSOs based in 
 Cirencester. Cllr Parsons (GCC) will raise these concerns with the Chairman of 
 the Police Authority when he next meets with him. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land wished to know when the next meeting of the 
 Traffic Committee was due to be held. The Clerk will organise a meeting at a 
 mutually convenient time for most of the Committee members. Cllr Stuart 
 suggested that the most appropriate time would be around 6pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) reported that the back filling earth 
 works on Lake 16 had ceased and the plan was to plant trees there. Restoration 
 is the responsibility of CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) reported that he GCC Enforcement 
 Officer had visited the waste transfer operation in Broadway Lane and insisted 
 that an application for the operation was made. The temporary period of 28 days 
 had expired and from the volume of material on the site it was obvious that the 
 business was of a permanent nature. Cllr Harris asked that the hours of 
 operation are controlled to take account of the possible disturbance to nearby 
 residents. Cllr Parsons asked the Clerk to note that the contact email for the 
 Enforcement Officer was<br>
 <a href="mailto:steve.harris@gloucestershire.gov.uk">steve.harris@gloucestershire.gov.uk</a> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons was pleased to report that the new method of 
 road repairs with hot tar was more satisfactory than in the past. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons will speak with Chris Franklin, 
 Gloucestershire Highways to see if something can be arranged to solve the 
 dilemma of the Poplar trees in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 9.55pm.</p>
