    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 11th DECEMBER 2002</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Chairman Cllr Mrs J. Gardiner welcomed Rachael Stanway (CDC) to this
    private meeting of Parish Councillors. One member of the public awaiting to attend the
    Parish Council meeting was invited to remain. Ms Stanway explained that a percentage of
    the capital cost of the development on Jubilee Gardens was earmarked for public art and
    thought that the budget for this site was in the region of £8,000. She then gave a power
    point presentation which illustrated a selection of work from various artists' portfolios.
    Constructed items shown included articles in glass, metal, stone, wood, ceramics, street
    furniture, sculpture and paving. Parish Councillors were of the opinion that an
    artistically designed footpath was the best option. Whatever the final product it would
    only be applicable to the site concerned. CDC would consult with local residents for their
    preferred options before the artists' briefs were commissioned. Ms Stanway then left the
    meeting at 7.25pm.</p>

    <td>There were two members of the public present.<br>
    The Chairman Cllr Mrs Gardiner opened the meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Dunn.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 13 NOVEMBER 2002</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr King that the Minutes were a true and
    accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by the
    Chairperson Cllr Mrs J. Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    Matters arising would be discussed when the Chairmen of the Committees made their reports.
    The Clerk then reported on his actions over the previous month.<br>
    All payments to suppliers were dispatched and response forms faxed to CDC.<br>
    On 14 November I attended the inaugural meeting of the Cirencester Partnership at Stratton
    House Hotel. The Council in Cirencester as the closest largest town to South Cerney would
    act as an umbrella organisation to attract funding for mutually beneficial schemes. The
    Town Clerk of Cirencester Mr. A. Crook had invited representatives of local organisations
    and communities to ascertain their willingness to partner Cirencester in applying for such
    funding. I am certain that South Cerney would benefit from such a partnership and intend
    with the Parish Council's permission to become involved on its behalf. I would welcome a
    Parish Councillor to accompany me to the next meeting which will be held on 12 December at
    Deer Park School. An officer from the Forward Planning section at CDC informed me that he
    expected the Local Plan will be published on Monday 16 December. If so the six week period
    for consultation would expire on 27 January 03. Articles were delivered for publication in
    Cerney News.<br>
    Whitton Associates had replied to questions pertaining to the Upper Up park development. I
    contacted Cornhill Insurance regarding the insurance of the completed project who informed
    me that if the scheme was professionally constructed it did not envisage any problems with
    its insurance cover. Furthermore its location at the far end of the playing fields was not
    an issue. A member of the Hinchinbrook Country Park in Cambridgeshire had advised that a
    representative from the UK BMX Society be consulted on the mound to obviate any design
    inconsistencies.<br>
    The External Auditor has completed his inspection of the Parish Council's accounts. A
    notice informing residents to this effect has been placed on the noticeboard in Clarks
    Hay. There is a reference to the Risk Assessment which is expected to be completed by the
    Parish Council in the next financial year.<br>
    On Tuesday 3 December I met with Steve Griffiths of MacVenture play contractors of
    Eastleach at Upper Up. He is confident that the tower slide can be altered to comply with
    safety regulations and he will prepare a plan with costings to this effect.<br>
    Also on 3 December I visited Mrs Philippa King, Manageress at Le Spa in Cirencester to
    inspect play equipment which Ms Linda Lloyd is intent on donating to South Cerney Parish
    Council. The only problem is that arrangements will have to be made for its removal and
    reconstruction. I spoke with the Small Business Advisor from Lloyds Bank regarding the new
    rules for the management of the Parish Council's banking arrangements. The interest rate
    on the current account will be increased from 0.1% to 1.5%. The deposit account's interest
    rate will rise from 2% to 2.45% but instead of the present 15 days notice for transfers it
    will be increased to 30 days with a loss of interest if that notice is not given. The
    alternative was to have a Business Interest Instant Access account at 1.75% which I
    declined. TD Construction has completed the alteration to the guide rails on the Upper Up
    ramp. D. Taylor GCC Highways has been told and has informed me that he has ordered the new
    barriers for the exit to the carriageway. GCC Highways will erect them and then TD
    Construction can complete the job. I have kept Natasha McKenna Grant Coordinator at CDC
    informed of the progress. Richard Kent of the Cotswold and Stroud Road Policing Unit has
    indicated that he will attend a meeting with Parish Councillors on 8 January before the
    Parish Council meeting. A reply from GCC Highways to the invitation is awaited.<br>
    <strong>Clerk's Annual Assessment</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner, who was absent at the last Parish Council meeting when the Clerk's
    assessment was made, personally thanked the Clerk for his efforts. The Clerk gratefully
    accepted the recognition.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 9
    December.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Local Plan</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC) informed the meeting that her latest information was the Local
    Plan would be published on 2 January. In the light of this news the Parish Council
    acknowledged that the Public Meeting planned for that day must now be rescheduled and a
    notice published in Cerney News informing residents about the postponement.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.0649/1/Z Minor Amendment<br>
    Erection of second floor extension at 13 Meadow Way, South Cerney, Glos.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the design was not in keeping with the surrounding local
    style. It would be potentially intrusive to neighbours to have a balcony on the first
    floor overlooking them.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.1599/A<br>
    Erection of one (1) dwelling at Morning Dew, Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the planned dwelling would be too big for the plot although
    a smaller building would be more acceptable. Entry to and exit from the proposed site
    would be hazardous as this part of Cerney Wick Lane is at its narrowest.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.2249/E<br>
    Erection of new dwelling (revision to previously approved scheme CT.2249/D)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.3704/H<br>
    Increase height of natural stone boundary wall to approximately 1.7m at Southways, Station
    Road, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4630/P<br>
    Single storey rear extension at Boxwood Cottage, School Lane, South Cerney (to be
    ratified).<br>
    NO OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    <br>
    CT.5788/V<br>
    Variation of condition of planning approval under reference CT.5788/P<br>
    (removal of restriction of open hours on Sundays) at 7 The Laurels, Clarks Hay, South
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.5788/W<br>
    Change of use to veterinary surgery at 1 The Laurels, Clarks Hay, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8058/B<br>
    Two storey side and rear extensions to existing dwelling at 2 The Leaze, South Cerney,
    Cirencester<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8262 Additional/Amended Plans<br>
    Demolition of bungalow and shed and the erection of three (3) detached cottages, garages
    to plots 2 and 3 and formation of vehicular access at Dunromin and the adjoining Coalyard,
    Silver Street, South Cerney, Glos.<br>
    The Parish Council with the exception of Cllr Mrs Spriggs who declared a personal and
    prejudicial interest as a neighbour and Cllr Stuart who declared a professional interest
    agreed that the frontage is simply not wide enough to accommodate three dwellings (even if
    two of them are a pair of semi-detached) because they would be too close up against the
    existing dwellings on either side of the plot. Two dwellings on this plot would be
    acceptable providing they are of a suitable scale (to be ratified).<br>
    OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    <br>
    CT.8275<br>
    Erection of single storey extension, first floor side extension and detached<br>
    double garage at Churchgate House, Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos GL7 5QJ Besides the
    double garage blocking the view towards the adjacent church and in front of the building
    line it was proposed to erect it over the line of the existing water main. Velux windows
    in the roof space overlooking the church would be intrusive. The overall volume and plot
    setting is out of scale. The front elevation of drawing 2241/03 is wrong and very
    misleading.<br>
    OBJECTION <br>
    <br>
    CT.8276<br>
    Erection of one (1) dwelling at land adjoining Dryft Cottage, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the proposed plot was too small for development. The design
    of the dwelling was alien to the surrounding local style. Exit from and entry to the site
    would be hazardous as the plot was at the narrowest point on Station Road.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Gardiner that the Parish
    Council agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to ratify its
    decisions with the exception of CT.8262. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the decision reached on CT.8262. With the exception of Cllr Mrs Spriggs
    and Cllr Stuart who had declared an interest and did not vote the Parish Council was all
    in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.0006/3/L<br>
    Single storey sailing club with ancillary outbuildings, car parking and boat parking at
    Lake 16, Spine Road, South Cerney, Glos.<br>
    <br>
    CT.0144/4/N<br>
    Two storey side extension; front and rear porches at 6 Robert Franklin Way, South Cerney,
    Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5UD<br>

    Demolition of existing porch and erection of new porch at Box Cottage, High Street, South
    Cerney, Glos GL7 5UG<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    CT.7719/B<br>
    Renewal of outline planning permission ref CT.7719/A for residential development and the
    construction of vehicular and pedestrian access at Box Bush Farm, Station Road, South

    <br>
    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT.3377/D &amp; CT.3377/G<br>
    &nbsp;The main reason given by the Inspector in dismissing both appeals was that the site
    was too cramped to accommodate a separate dwelling.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on
    9 December.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Response from Audit Commission</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that no reply had been received. Risk Assessment<br>
    Cllr King and the Clerk would meet to prepare a draft risk assessment for discussion.<br>
    <strong>External Auditor</strong><br>
    A qualified audit certificate was issued by the External Auditor for the Parish Council's
    accounts year ending March 2002. A notice to this effect was placed on the noticeboard.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Payments</strong><br>

    Busy Fingers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photocopying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £26.09
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £925.99<br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for November.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr King that the Parish Council agrees to
    make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Precept</strong><br>
    CDC required notification of the required precept for the year commencing 1 April 2003 not
    later than 10 January 2003. It was agreed that the Committee would discuss the demand at
    its meeting on 6 January and its deliberations presented to the Parish Council on 8
    January. The Clerk was asked to arrange that the Finance Committee be convened as the
    final meeting on 6 January. A request to consider that finance be provided for
    improvements and refurbishment of the Village Hall had been received. Funds amounting to
    £8,780 were needed to provide a toilet for disabled users and the improvement of the
    access ramp both of which were considered a top priority. Of lesser precedence was the
    refurbishment of the stage area, the male and female toilets and updating radiators in the
    hall and committee room estimated to cost £6,660. Total funding required therefore would
    be £15,440. Cllr Nicholas declared that this request for funding was directly linked to
    the fact that grants from the CDC were no longer readily available.<br>

    &nbsp;It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council
    accepts this quote for £523.00 (ex VAT). The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    &nbsp;Quotation to install 1.8m x 1.2m concrete base for new bench at Limes<br>
    &nbsp;It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Gardiner that the Parish
    Council accepts this quote for £140.00 (ex VAT). The Parish Council was all in favour.
    The Clerk would now go ahead and order the seat, as previously agreed, in the same style
    as the one installed near the Luggs in Station Road.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 9 December.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that Barry Greenaway considered it desirable that a further light be
    erected near the footbridge in Bow Wow. He informed him that Mr Bill Sermon would survey
    the site and hopefully a light could be erected in the near future. He also stated that
    the Parish Council would be expected to make a contribution towards the cost as previously
    agreed. Upper Up Tower Slide<br>
    The Clerk reported on a meeting he had with Steve Griffiths of MacVenutre Play Company who
    agreed to refurbish the tower slide for £523 (ex VAT). Mr Griffiths suggested that the
    horizontal rungs be replaced with a vertical climbing wall and dismissed the option of a
    scramble net or a fixed ramp with a pull up rope as this configuration would require the
    safety surface to be dug up and extended.<br>
    <strong>Ramp at Upper Up</strong><br>
    TD Construction confirmed that the alterations to the safety rails had been carried out.
    The Clerk informed D. Taylor (GCC Highways) who had ordered two safety barriers for the
    carriageway entrance to the ramp. When D. Taylor has installed the barriers TD
    Construction will complete the contract. Cllr Stuart noted that the design and workmanship
    of the alterations was unsatisfactory at the moment.<br>
    <strong>Tree Survey</strong><br>
    The Committee decided to include its recommendations on the management of trees on the
    Piece when members of the Committee carry out an inventory over the winter period of all
    trees for which the Parish Council was responsible. Sub Station at Limes<br>
    No action had as yet been taken to secure the sub station at the Limes. If required the
    Committee agreed that a further request be made in January.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Car Park</strong><br>
    A quote to top dress the car park at Upper Up had been received from Phoenix Contractors.
    The Committee agreed that Andrew Timbrell and Jeff Woodhouse of Driffield be asked to
    provide further quotes.<br>
    <strong>Algae Removal</strong><br>
    GPFA recommended that a Brays Emulsion (cresylic acid) be used to remove algae. The Clerk
    has ascertained that the emulsion can be applied by a non-professional if done so sensibly
    and with due care and attention making sure that children and pets are absent during the
    exercise. The pesticide or similar product suitable for patio cleaning should be available
    at most garden centres or hardware stores.<br>
    <strong>Daffodil Bulbs</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart wished to thank those who had helped in the bulb planting exercise.<br>
    <strong>Car Parking at Clarks Hay/Station Road</strong><br>
    The Clerk had visited the owners of cars which were parking on the verge of the corner at
    Clarks Hay and Station Road and asked them to desist. They had politely agreed.
    Unfortunately the cars have been reported to be still parking illegally and the Clerk was
    asked to write to the residents concerned.<br>
    <strong>Signs at the junction of Spine Road, Station Road and Cerney Wick Lane</strong><br>
    Mr M. Grace suspected that the Watermark sign was on GCC Highway property and if so
    Watermark would be asked to remove it. As the Shack had planning permission to operate as
    a restaurant it was entitled to advertise. He would check that the lettering on the
    plastic promotional sheet was of an acceptable size.<br>
    <strong>Tree in Station Road Ditch</strong><br>
    The Parish Council thanked Cllr Harris for removing the broken tree from the ditch in
    Station Road. Cllr Harris added that he had also ground the stump to below grass cutting
    level to enable the grass cutters to mow over the top of it.<br>
    <strong>Donation of Play Equipment</strong><br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour of accepting the gift of play equipment from Ms Lloyd
    subject to further reports from Cllr Gardiner and Cllr King. If these surveys are
    favourable it was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Gardiner to ask Steve
    Griffiths of MacVenture Play to quote for its removal and re-erection. The Parish Council
    was all in favour. Cllr Stuart suggested that Ms Lloyd be thanked for her generous offer
    and a plaque affixed to the equipment acknowledging the fact. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner and seconded by Cllr King that a sum up to £3,000 be approved for moving the
    play equipment. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported that the litter bin at Cerney Wick play area needed to be emptied.
    Cllr Harris agreed with Cllr Gardiner that the stile at the southern end of Robert
    Franklin Way play area was in need of repair. Cllr Harris volunteered to remove loose
    chain links and cut back the opening which should suffice until a decision was taken on
    its refurbishment. Cllr Stuart would carry out the next round of inspections.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest and observed proceedings. Cllr Nicholas explained the
    implications of a reply from the Standards Board to a query on the possibility of awarding
    the contract for the Upper Up park scheme to a Parish Councillor. If it is considered by a
    member of the Parish Council that s/he is a friend of the Councillor then s/he must
    declare the nature of his/her interest. Having done so Parish Councillors may discuss and
    vote on the issue unless their interest is also prejudicial. If that is the case such a
    member must withdraw from the meeting and not seek to improperly influence the debate.
    Whitton Associates had replied to questions pertaining to the Upper Up park development.
    The Clerk contacted Mrs Ayres at Cornhill Insurance regarding insurance cover for the
    completed project. She informed him that if the scheme was professionally constructed
    Cornhill did not envisage any problems in insuring it. Furthermore its location at the far
    end of the playing fields was not an issue. A member of the Hinchinbrook Country Park in
    Cambridgeshire had advised that a representative from the UK BMX Society be consulted on
    the mound to obviate any design inconsistencies and pointed out that a grant could be
    available from Sport England to help fund its construction. It was proposed by Cllr
    Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Stuart that Whitton Associates be instructed to appoint
    James Harris Contracting as its preferred tenderer. With the exception of Cllr Harris who
    abstained the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Bollards</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart complained that as both sets of bollards were being regularly damaged by
    passing traffic they should be removed forthwith. Cllr Stuart asked Cotswold District Cllr
    Mrs Clark (CDC) and Cllr Jones (CDC) to investigate the rigid bureaucracy being applied to
    issuing licences for the Rural Cinema.<br>
    <strong>Rate Demand</strong><br>
    Cllr Jones (CDC) reported that the local government settlement for CDC had been increased
    by 3.2% this year but there would be a 9% increase in the rate demand from the District
    Council. The present arrangement of 50% discount on Council Tax demand on second homes
    would be increased to 10% but would be at the discretion of the District Council.<br>
    <strong>Traffic Speed</strong><br>
    Cllr King reported on excessive traffic speed, especially by a motorcycle, in Broadway
    Lane. An invitation had been accepted by PC Richard Kent to attend a meeting of Parish
    Councillors next month and a reply was expected from GCC Highways.<br>
    <strong>Cerney News</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Spriggs informed the Parish Council that Cerney News was now charging for
    advertising some charitable village activities. It was noticeable that advertisements
    publicising rummage and jumble sales were no longer appearing in the paper and this was
    regrettable. Other Parish Councillors were in agreement and the Clerk was to write to the
    Editor, Mrs J. Squire asking her to reconsider this change in policy.<br>
    <strong>Stray Golf Balls</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Spriggs complained that excessive numbers of stray golf balls were ending up on
    the adjacent public right of way to the course. It was now a matter of public safety and
    efforts should be made to stop this.<br>
    <strong>Mr Wrightson</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported on a conversation she had with Mr Wrightson who apologised for
    not being able to clean out the ditch because he had a bad back. The Parish Council is
    very appreciative of the voluntary job done by Mr Wrightson and agreed to publish its
    thanks in the January issue of Cerney News.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Mrs Gardiner closed the meeting at 9.25pm.</td>
