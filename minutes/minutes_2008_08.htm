    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 13th AUGUST 2008</strong>.</p>

At 7pm Cllr Stuart welcomed Dr Gill McInerney representing Indigo, a local organisation
providing free confidential information and advice services for young people. Dr McInerney
is a part-time GP at Phoenix surgery, full time mother of two children one a 13 year old girl
and an 11 year old boy. Dr McInerney gave a brief history of the scheme stating that in 2000
a discussion with the Youth Service, School Nurses and students from Deer Park and
Kingshill schools defined a need to develop services to bring down the level of teenage
pregnancies which is the highest in Europe and only the USA out performs the UK in these
incidents. For example the Netherlands has about one-third and France half in comparison
with the UK. The aim was to provide free confidential advice and information to teenagers.
The drop-in centres are open to all youngsters to attend and have their own waiting and
consultation rooms. As the service has become more widely known clients have introduced
their friends and so the list of users grows. The drop-in surgery at the Phoenix Surgery caters
for students at Deer Park and Kingshill has its own although the students there tend to be
more isolated as most of them are taken to school by bus which in turn restricts the children
from interacting. The drop in at Kingshill deals with a much larger range of topics than
others and there appears to be a greater number of students with special needs. The target
age range is 13–16 year olds and the main group would be aged between 14 and 15. It is not
generally known but it is illegal for children under 13 to have sex. Drop-in centres give a
full range of medical advice – not just pregnancy tests, issue condoms, morning after pills
and other contraceptives. Sex health checks are also provided. The service costs about
£5,500 a year to run and of all the requests for funding sent to parish councils only South
Cerney obliged this year. To continue to operate the service Indigo is trying to encourage
benefactors to provide a regular donation. Cllr Stuart thanked Dr McInerney for taking the
time to make the presentation and her scheme would be considered at the next meeting of
the Precept Committee early next year. Dr McInerney left the meeting at 7.30pm.

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 9th JULY 2008</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the minutes were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in 
 favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge presented a mock up of YPC publicity material
 which will promote the Youth Parish Council and its members. A decision would
 be taken shortly on the final design. Members of the YPC were working on a
 project Here By Right which was an accredited award towards a low level GCSE.
 Certificates will be awarded at a ceremony to be held at Cotswold District
 Council offices at Trinity Road on July 11th. Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart, Cllr
 Walker and the Clerk volunteered to support the members of the YPC by attending
 the event which was also the official launch of Play Matters in the Cotswolds,
 a CDC Play Strategy. Cllr Walker reported that Dame Kelly Holmes had declined
 the invitation although the agents concerned suggested other names. Cllr Stuart
 reported that ground work contractors would start on the MUGA this week,
 slightly earlier than expected. Park Leisure would start their installation of
 the kick wall on Monday 21st July. The project was expected to be in operation
 by August. The Finance Committee had agreed to a recommendation from the
 Responsible Finance Officer that the balance of the YPC account be increased to
 £2,000 to make up for its contribution to the Community First grant. The Parish
 Council was in favour. Joe Lodge then left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge stated that on his return from holiday his email 
 inbox had 27 emails relating to issues concerning the MUGA. He was grateful for 
 the information and would be meeting with those residents who were not in 
 favour of the new play structure to discuss their objections. On the 11th July 
 “Here By Right” awards had been collected by YPC members at a ceremony held at 
 the CDC offices in Trinity Road, Cirencester. Suitable confirmation would be 
 added to the design of the YPC’s stationery. The provision of Christmas lights 
 was being discussed by the YPC and Alistair Kennedy has been put in charge of 
 arrangements. The YPC had received an application from Mary Mychaleckyj for 
 funding support of South Cerney Outdoor Education Centre (SCOEC). Cllr Stuart 
 informed Joe that the Youth Shelter erectors were expected to start work on the 
 installation of the shelter tomorrow, Thursday 14th August and hopefully the 
 work would be completed satisfactorily by 5pm the following day. As Joe had no 
 further business to report he left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEETING – 7.45pm</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart proposed that the Parish Council meeting be 
 temporarily suspended in order to deal with a petition which had been presented 
 by Mrs J. Roberts. The Parish Council was all in favour and the meeting was 
 suspended. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mrs Jennifer Roberts read from a prepared statement as 
 follows: “Mr Chairman and Parish Councillors, thank you allowing me to speak to 
 you this evening. I am representing hundreds of parishioners who are still 
 waiting for the build out to take place. Having been sent a letter from 
 Gloucestershire Highways stating this would happen and seeing nothing to the 
 contrary either on the notice boards or in the local paper. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">We have raised this petition because over the last five 
 years little has been done to solve the problems in Clarks Hay with regards to 
 being able to cross the road safely. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">We are met on a daily basis by cars indiscriminately 
 parked on the pavement or over the keep clear signs, outside the United Church, 
 which although cursory we had hoped would allow pedestrians to gain access to 
 the pavement outside the United Church. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The content of this petition was a random selection of 
 households taken throughout the village. I knocked at 300 doors and received 
 replies from 215 of which three people did not sign. The reasons given was that 
 one worked for Mr Kingsbury and two wanted a pedestrian crossing outside the 
 Post Office. The petition included a section for users comments which are as 
 follows - to visit Post Office/Church/Chemist/Laurels Surgery/Vets Red 
 Onion/Flower shop or personal comments. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The United Church has a seedling group on a Tuesday 
 morning which coincides with the baby clinic held at the Laurels Surgery. This 
 means that mothers with young children have to cross Clarks Hay to attend the 
 seedling function feeling that they take their life in their hands to do so. 
 This group has expressed their frustration at the ridiculous situation in 
 Clarks Hay and are disgusted that nothing has been done by the Parish Council 
 to solve the road safety issues, and are appalled that the build out is not 
 taking place. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday mornings there is also, as a community 
 initiative by the United Church, a Coffee Morning and Lunch Club attended by 
 some 24–36 people of a various ages. This means many who are vulnerable have to 
 cross Clarks Hay to get their pension or lunch and then come on to church.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Leaving this building Emily Reynold was nearly knocked 
 down and killed, only by the quick presence of mind, my pulling her back saved 
 her although her walker was hit by a white van – Incident number 454 logged 
 with the Police at Cirencester Police station. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I visited 28 different roads through out the village so as 
 to obtain an overall picture. I was prepared to meet with opposition and would 
 have welcomed the opportunity to discuss the issue, but met none. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I spoke to many residents including one lady in Station 
 Road whose husband has Parkinsons and she has to push him in a wheelchair to 
 the Laurels Surgery. She says she dreads doing this as she is forced to cross 
 between parked cars in Clarks Hay with no line of vision. She is in her 
 seventies and a full time carer. She is by no means the only one who made this 
 statement to me. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I trust you have read all the comments by residents that 
 forcibly want this issue solved. They do not believe that a further survey and 
 village traffic plan is the answer. One gentleman pointed out that the survey 
 would probably be next year and then followed by a consultation period of say 
 six months delay and then at the end of all this whatever was decided upon 
 would then rely on Gloucestershire Highways having the funding to implement 
 this. Chances of change once again nil, however he wished me luck. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">All were in favour and many said shame on the Parish 
 Council that it had come to the point of a disabled person having to campaign 
 to get something done. Some residents admired my belief that the Parish Council 
 would actually help us. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I have had discussions, with Gloucestershire Highways, 
 Police Community Support Officers, Road Traffic Police Officers who have all 
 stated that unless an enforceable stance was in place, they were unable to help 
 with this situation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It would appear there is a great reluctance by the Parish 
 Council to move forward on this issue. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Chairman, you said that the Parish Council has the 
 power to veto Gloucestershire Highways, I am now respectfully asking on behalf 
 of hundreds of members of this community that the Parish Councillors, who we 
 voted into office, are mindful of the more vulnerable members of our community, 
 young and old alike, and use this power to instigate a positive move to solve 
 this problem in the very near future. We have had surveys, consultations and 
 suggestions all of which have produced nothing. We are now facing another year 
 of dark nights and inconsiderate car parking. Please can you open your hearts 
 and minds and help us now!” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mr David Roberts then read a prepared statement: “Mr 
 Chairman, Councillors. Jennifer and I attended the Monday Village Maintenance 
 meeting with the express wish of suggesting a way to move this ongoing problem 
 of safely crossing Clarks Hay for all members of the parish forward. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">We suggested an interim measure until any projected 
 survey, consultation period, funding and consequently reconstruction work could 
 finally take place, for the whole of the parish some months into the future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Although very admirable to speak in terms against a 
 piecemeal approach of which I expect in the ideal world we would all agree, 
 however the target area of the Clarks Hay petition believe this requires your 
 immediate attention now. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">We suggested an improvement to the keep clear outside the 
 United Church to be blacked out and replaced with either double yellow lines or 
 a simple, shallow build out of which would be an immediate improvement, both of 
 which could easily be eradicated on full implementation of any future plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It is recognised that you had the power to halt the build 
 out and likewise you have the power to implement an alternative immediately.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mrs Doreen Laws stated that “something needs to be done 
 but didn’t know what”. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Tony Squire said that during his time on the Parish 
 Council he recalled that a plan to alter the carriageway had been put on hold 
 or was sent for redesigning after an artist’s impression of a possible solution 
 was deemed too dangerous. He did agree, however, that something other than the 
 present arrangement on the garage side needed to be implemented. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) remarked that as the District Council 
 was now responsible for the management of parking on yellow lines and had only 
 four employees allocated, a response to a singular parking problem would be 
 unlikely as there was more than 70 miles of lines to patrol. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land was concerned with the plight of the elderly 
 and youth who crossed Clarks Hay in the vicinity of the garage, pubs and post 
 office. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris agreed with the generally held view that 
 something must be done. He suggested that a reduction in the speed limit to 
 20mph or a paved area on the carriageway to slow road users down might help. He 
 did not think that the build-out was the total answer and any changes must be 
 carried out in conjunction with a larger scheme covering all roads within the 
 village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart thanked all for their comments. He concluded 
 that everyone concerned must work together and look at the problem from an 
 overall village perspective. There were at least three different schemes 
 currently analysing the problem: the Village Appraisal, the Village Plan and 
 the SARA plan. An overall scheme to improve the situation for everyone was what 
 was needed. Because of the expertise required it would be sensible to employ 
 the services of a professional to report on the overall all requirements of the 
 built up area of the village. To that end a working group would be needed to 
 work with Parish Councillors to move it forward. He then invited Mr &amp; Mrs 
 Roberts to join the group. Both were willing to do so. He criticised them for 
 “ploughing their own furrow” in the past. Now was the time to move on and to 
 work together for the good of the community. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart then reconvened the Parish Council meeting at 
 8.20pm and proposed that the Parish Council promote item 11 on the agenda. The 
 Parish Council agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ROAD SAFETY APPRAISAL EXPERT </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart recommended that the Parish Council considers 
 obtaining a comprehensive expert appraisal of how it could improve the safety 
 of all road and pavement users in the village, in order to implement Objectives 
 3 and 6 of its village plan. To this end it would be necessary to reopen 
 negotiations with the consultants and find out how much a report would cost. 
 Cllr Mrs Land stated that something should be done in the interim period. She 
 continued that the Parish Council should engage with the police and the 
 highways authority on the problem. As a first step Parish Councillors did not 
 object to an approach to the previous consultants as to likely costs of such a 
 project. It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Walker that an 
 approach is made to the consultants to ascertain costs of such a report. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At 8.30pm all visitors then left the room and the Parish 
 Council meeting continued.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that Ian Kennedy had informed the 
 police that he was organising a SARA meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reminded Parish Councillors that no 
 arrangements had been agreed for them to have their photograph taken for the 
 village calendar. Cllr Caunce was not in favour of a formal photograph and 
 favoured one where councillors could be seen partaking in a village activity. 
 He suggested that a photograph of parish councillors joining in the WoW (Walk 
 on Wednesday) initiative in September would provide such an opportunity. Cllr 
 Harris suggested a gathering at the recently erected kick wall at the MUGA. 
 Cllr Stuart will check on availability and email councillors with a date.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 10th July, along with Cllr Stuart, I met with 
 Chris Franklin and Adam Thomas from Gloucestershire Highways to discuss 
 outstanding matters but especially the proposed build out at the junction of 
 Clarks Hay and Silver Street. Chris Franklin apologised unreservedly for the 
 lack of consultation with the Parish Council over the proposed scheme. Cllr 
 Stuart informed him that the plan had created more controversy from residents 
 than he could remember from those objecting to the idea. When discussed at the 
 Parish Council at its monthly meeting not one councillor had argued for the 
 change. Cllr Stuart stated that a complete survey of traffic flows throughout 
 the village should be taken and an overall plan put forward for consideration. 
 He was not in favour of piecemeal solutions. Mr Franklin would reflect on the 
 argument put forward but did say that it was not in the interests of 
 Gloucestershire Highways to force a result. Cllr Stuart met up with Mrs J. 
 Roberts shortly after the meeting and explained to her the outcome of the 
 discussion. I raised the problem of the carriageway flooding in Cerney Wick. Mr 
 Franklin stated that there was little that could be done as the water had no 
 where to go until the level of the adjacent river dropped and allowed it to 
 seep away. Adam Thomas would inspect the pipes across the ditch in Station Road 
 to determine ownership and contact the relevant authorities to see if anything 
 could be done. The missing footpath link in Silver Street was examined but the 
 cost of upgrading the path was prohibitively expensive and could not be 
 considered in this financial year. It was estimated by Mr Thomas that the cost 
 for a tamped gravel path 1.2m wide would be in the region of £10,000. Mr 
 Franklin was not in favour of more signs but did agree to consider erecting 
 some to give directions to the school. Mr Franklin would pass on a copy of the 
 External Works catalogue which would give information on the creation of car 
 parks. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After that meeting we joined a roadside discussion with 
 Mrs J. Roberts, Mike Barton (GCC PROW) and Eddie Ducker (Dave Telling’s agent) 
 to discuss the line of the footpath alongside the garage to Clarks Hay. 
 Negotiations are continuing. Mike Barton briefed Cllr Stuart on further 
 developments of on-going PROW projects. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 11th July I attended the official launch of Play 
 Matters in the Cotswolds. Present were Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart. Also in 
 attendance were Sinead Peare and Thomas Nicholas members of the Youth Parish 
 Council who collected certificates for their involvement in local affairs. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 15th July I joined Cllr Stuart at a meeting of the Play 
 Portfolio Group at CDC to give a report to Rosemary Lynn (CDC Coordinator of 
 the Big Lottery Grant) about progress on the MUGA and Youth Shelter 
 installation. Geoff Chapman, Poulton PC described a novel official opening 
 ceremony where those involved in the planning of the scheme together would cut 
 a ribbon with scissors supplied. Other initiatives planned through the Summer 
 Off The Streets scheme were discussed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the 17th July I attended a meeting at the Village Hall 
 to welcome members of an international delegation who were visiting South 
 Cerney on a fact finding mission. Cllr Mike Stuart and Cllr Peter Jay 
 represented the Parish Council and both gave a talk on the history of South 
 Cerney and how the Parish Council interacts with the community. Joe Lodge gave 
 a brief description of the composition and justification of the Youth Parish 
 Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the 5th August I attended a meeting of the South 
 Gloucestershire Police and Community Consultative Group at the Memorial Hall, 
 Lechlade. Inspector Williams informed me that PCSO Lesley Pooley had been 
 transferred because of operational needs and he assured me that he had every 
 confidence in her replacement PCSO Daniel Sinclair. He did apologise for the 
 delay taken to inform the Parish Council of the change but excused it as he was 
 away on sick leave and the stand-in, an acting Inspector, was not totally aware 
 of the significance of the move. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During July of the 23 available working days I averaged 3 
 hours and 15 minutes per day which is approximately 20 minutes less per day 
 than my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 11th AUGUST</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart, 
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker attended the meeting. Two members of the 
 public were also present.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had sent an apology for his absence as he 
 was on holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Suspension of Meeting</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce suspended the meeting in order that Mr &amp; Mrs 
 Roberts could ask the members to consider an interim plan her and her husband 
 had designed for a traffic calming scheme in Clarks Hay. Cllr Caunce explained 
 to the visitors that it was not part of the remit of his committee to deal with 
 the matter. The Clerk informed them that as the subject was so emotive it would 
 be discussed at the Parish Council meeting on Wednesday 13th under agenda item 
 no.11. Cllr Stuart then outlined the procedure he would adopt at the meeting on 
 Wednesday by similarly suspending the Parish Council meeting in accordance with 
 Standing Orders and allowing members of the public to address the assembled 
 Parish Councillors for a maximum of three (3) minutes only. He would only allow 
 original proposals on the subject and would interrupt any person repeating an 
 argument. After, the meeting would be reconvened and Parish Councillors would 
 consider the proposal on the agenda and vote accordingly.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2425 – <b>PROW issues</b>. Cllr Stuart informed the 
 Committee that Mike Barton (GCC) had been seconded for three months to the GCC 
 Flood Forum and Phil Cluely would be acting in his place. Cllr Stuart will meet 
 with Phil Cluely at 9am tomorrow Thursday 14th. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2425 – <b>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment.</b> Cllr 
 Stuart was continuing to research plans to improve the surface and drainage of 
 the car park. One new idea was to create a soak-away in the centre of the car 
 park with a feature to deter vehicles from abusing the finished surface. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2425 – <b>Damage to Safety Surface at Upper Up</b>. A 
 quotation has been received from Mr George Taylor to repair the safety surface. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2426 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards. </b>Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb has arranged to meet with a representative from Garrick Outdoor at 3pm 
 this coming Wednesday to inspect the proposed site. Cllr Mrs Chubb stated that 
 this company had provided the lowest quotation so far. Cllr Mrs Chubb reported 
 that she had met the representative and had a useful exchange of views. She 
 expected to receive more detailed information on her discussions next week. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2426 – <b>Maintenance of Land in Public Ownership.</b> 
 Cllr Harris had provided a provisional specification of ground maintenance jobs 
 that will be required extra to those of the grass cutting contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris then declared a prejudicial interest and left 
 the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After some discussion the Committee agreed that 
 contractors would need to describe the system and processes they intended to 
 use and submit a management scheme for the upkeep and maintenance of the 
 publicly owned land in South Cerney and land currently maintained by the Parish 
 Council in Cerney Wick. Contractors would be asked to state their hourly rates 
 and minimum charge, covering the topics as detailed and other aspects as they 
 felt fit, for example: ditch clearance as required. Cllr Stuart added that it 
 was “not the doing but knowing when” that was important. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Committee meeting Cllr Harris had returned to the 
 room. Cllr Caunce declared that the specification was an excellent document and 
 thanked Cllr Harris for his contribution. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Parish Council it was agreed that Cllr Caunce, Cllr 
 Stuart, Cllr Webb and the Clerk would meet, after the conference with Stuart 
 Milsom on Monday morning August 18th to discuss the final stages of the 
 reinstatement work at Upper Up, to expand the document prepared by Cllr Harris. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2426 – <b>Tree Survey Report</b>. At the Committee 
 meeting Cllr Harris had then declared a prejudicial interest and left the room. 
 Four quotations had been received and after the Committee analysed them it was 
 decided to recommend that the Finance Committee accepts the lowest from James 
 Harris Contracting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in order. 
 There was damage to the safety surface at the 360 deg swing which needed more 
 cable ties. There was one branch down on western boundary which needed to be 
 cut and cleared. Grass needs cutting. Cllr Caunce suggested that because of the 
 continuing need for Cllr Harris to declare a prejudicial interest in small 
 maintenance jobs, Cllr Walker might consider taking over the inspections from 
 Cllr Harris. Cllr Walker readily agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the safety surface was still 
 awaiting repair. The growth on the cycle mounds had been cut back by Glebe 
 Contractors although a large wasps nest had been disturbed which necessitated 
 its removal by the Pest Control department of CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The pyracanthus bush prunings on the northern boundary had 
 been removed. The Clerk was asked to enquire from Dave King how much it would 
 cost to cut back the over growing brambles at the entrance to the play area to 
 the far side of the ditch. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was agreed that Finance Committee accepts the following 
 recommendations: George Taylor – Repair to the safety surface at Upper Up £575 
 plus VAT plus 10 bags of special sand; James Harris Contracting – Tree work as 
 per specification £122 plus VAT; Hartell NB Construction – Tarmaced area for 
 the MUGA £15,594.89 including VAT. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MUGA INSTALLATION PROGRESS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart gave a brief report on the installation. 
 Overall the faults discovered on the goal end would needed to be rectified. The 
 installers were aware and stated that these could be fixed in-situ. The youth 
 shelter was totally unacceptable and had been returned to the manufacturers. 
 Cllr Stuart had spoken directly with the Managing Director of Park Leisure who 
 had become personally involved with the problem and its solving. Cuts had been 
 made on the tarmac which did not match the installation. The manufacturers 
 recommended that a covering be applied which would not only rectify the problem 
 but would enhance the project. The installers of the shelter had driven their 
 post hole digger over the newly laid tarmac and had left tyre indentations on 
 the surface. Cllr Stuart had again reported this to the MD of Park Leisure but 
 awaited his reply. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VOTE OF THANKS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Parish Council agrees 
 that a vote of thanks be sent to Gloucestershire Highways for the recent 
 resurfacing of Clarks Hay, Silver Street and Broadway Lane. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the laurel hedge at the eastern 
 end of the Pocket Park needed to be cut back as it was over growing. The Clerk 
 was asked to get a quote for this work. There is also a dead tree which needs 
 to be replaced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At Upper Up major damage has been caused to the memorial 
 oak tree belonging to the Walsh family. The Clerk was to ask Glebe Contractors 
 to take more care when maintaining the grass around unstaked trees. He was also 
 to ask Glebe Contractors to spray the weeds around the memorial tree bases and 
 the gravel path in Jubilee Gardens. Cllr Stuart had noted that since the 
 Committee meeting areas were showing signs of having been sprayed. The Clerk 
 was advised to await further instructions before contacting Glebe Contractors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to write to Kelvin Wearing of 
 16 Beverstone Road, GL7 5XU to thank him for clearing the disused railway line 
 off Station Road. #</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris noted that the restrictive parking lines on 
 the Spine Road had not been repainted and asked the Clerk to remind 
 Gloucestershire Highways of the outstanding request. Chris Franklin has asked 
 his team to attend. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart informed the Committee that he had been 
 invited by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP to attend a meeting on September 18 to 
 debate highway matters. He informed the meeting that he had discussed the 
 Archer report with the police and let the MP know that a further meeting was 
 unnecessary. The speeds were generally acceptable and not excessive enough to 
 warrant a radar speed check. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that the french drains along the 
 Spine Road needed to be maintained. Constant deposits of slurry mud has 
 compacted over the drains which has encouraged weed growth. This combination 
 has rendered the drains unfit for purpose and they need to be cleared. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb noted that the cycle lines at the junction of 
 Cerney Wick lane and Station Road needed to be reinstated and asked the Clerk 
 to report this necessity to Gloucestershire Highways. Chris Franklin has asked 
 his team to attend. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to include a reminder on the 
 Task List about the development of the additional allotment allocation decision 
 by the Diocesan Board of Education (DBE) when it meets on 8th October. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8:35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 11th 
 AUGUST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Webb opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay and Cllr Nicholas had sent their apologies for absence as they were on 
 holiday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb noted that analysis of the spread sheet was in line with expectations 
 at this point in the cycle. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay notice board</b> <br>
 The Clerk had informed Betec that the re-affixing of the surface material was 
 unsatisfactory and that the enclosed area had not been upgraded. Payment of 
 their invoice will be made when the work has been accepted. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations from the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 George Taylor – Repair to the safety surface at Upper Up £575 plus VAT plus 10 
 bags of special sand; James Harris Contracting – Tree work as per specification 
 £122 plus VAT; Hartell NB Construction – Tarmaced area for the MUGA £15,594.89 
 including VAT. The Finance Committee had no objections to these payments and 
 recommended that the Parish Council concurs. Revised quotation of £110 from 
 Dave King to trim and remove overhanging growth to the hedge at the front of 
 Cerney Wick playing field. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr 
 Stuart that the Parish Council accepts the above recommendations. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Hall Roof <br>
 </b>Cllr Webb reported that it would be necessary, in the near future, to 
 rethatch the ridge of the Village Hall roof. Quotations had been sought and the 
 Village Hall Committee intend to accept a quotation for £6,480 exclusive of VAT 
 to do the work. As the Village Hall is owned by the Parish Council and there is 
 in reserve a sum to provide for the rethatching, the Committee is minded to 
 agree to finance the contract. If the Parish Council agrees, this expense will 
 lower the reserve for the full refurbishment of the roof which will be needed 
 in approximately 10 years time. Therefore, at the next Precept meeting it will 
 be necessary to make provisions for this eventuality and the amount being 
 allocated to the reserve increased accordingly.</p>

 AUGUST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Webb attended the 
 meeting. <br>
 Cllr Webb opened the meeting at 9.10pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb reported that he had spoken on the Parish Council’s objection to the 
 revised scheme for a proposed house and formation of a hammerhead at land 
 parcel, Ham Lane at the Planning (Regulatory) Committee meeting on 6th August. 
 The Committee had voted 8-7 in favour of the application but the decision has 
 since been rejected on technicalities. The application will be represented at a 
 later date for another vote. Mr Squire has requested that the Parish Council 
 considers sending a representative to articulate its objection at the next 
 meeting. The Clerk was to contact Cllr Nicholas and see if he was willing to 
 attend the meeting scheduled for 27th August. If the item on the agenda was 
 early the Clerk would attend but he had an appointment with his doctor at 
 11.30am that morning and could not miss that if discussion on the application 
 was delayed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Parish Council meeting Cllr Stuart, on behalf of 
 the Parish Council, thanked Cllr Webb for appearing on its behalf at the 
 meeting on 6th August. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that he had tried in vain to contact 
 Geoffrey Franklin over the management of ditches on his land. He will continue 
 the quest. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to write to the occupiers of 
 Lynton and request that they cut back the overgrowing hedge to the front of 
 their property on School Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to make it clearer on the 
 agenda in future when a private meeting is taking place prior to the Parish 
 Council meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to contact Gloucestershire 
 Highways to move the cul-de-sac to the entrance of the Leaze from their 
 southern position in Berkeley Close.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reminded all present that the WoW (Walk 
 on Wednesday) initiative had been arranged for Wednesday 10th September from 
 8.45–9.15am and encouraged all Parish Councillors to take part. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman complained about inconsiderate drivers 
 exiting Waters Edge (Lake 10) to Cerney Wick lane. The ditches along the 
 stretch from Lake 10 and Lake 11 needed to be cleared. Further along Cerney 
 Wick lane after the entrance to the Sailing Club there was a hole in the road. 
 She asked the Clerk to notify Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that on Thursday 10th July he 
 attended a meeting with the Clerk and Chris Franklin to discuss the build out 
 in Clarks Hay. Afterwards he met with Glos PROW Mike Barton and Mr Ducker at 
 Titcombes Garage to discuss the footpath to Churn Close. At 6.30pm the went to 
 a farewell party for Dr Simon Pickering at CWP Society at Somerford Keynes. On 
 Friday 11th he joined with Cllr Nicholas and the Clerk at CDC to support a 
 Youth Participation Event. On Tuesday 15th July he and the Clerk attended a 
 meeting of the Cotswold Play Partnership to discuss progress of the Big Lottery 
 Grant for Youth Shelter. On Thursday 17th July delegates from 13 different 
 countries attending a conference on “shared commons” at the University of 
 Gloucestershire visited the village. Cllr Jay, YPC Chairman Joe Lodge and 
 myself spoke to this group regarding our Village Plan and the workings of the 
 Parish Council and Youth Parish Council. We were supported by the Clerk. It was 
 a top class event. Also in attendance was the elected Chair of Siddington 
 Parish Council, Cllr Mrs Alison Wagstaff and Professor Malcolm Moseley who 
 invited Cllr Jay, the Clerk and myself to attend their Parish Council meeting 
 in September when they will attempt to start their Village Plan. On Friday 25th 
 July I met with PC Jon Palfrey and PCSO Daniel Sinclair at Cirencester Police 
 Station to be briefed on the recent Archer speed surveys carried out in Station 
 Road and Cirencester Road. Basically the overall average speeds recorded over a 
 seven (7) day period would not usually warrant the police carrying out speed 
 surveillance checks but on seeing the very high top speeds recorded on 
 Cirencester Road it was agreed that the police will carry out a series of speed 
 checks in that area in the near future. These will be carried out by officers 
 with the authority to issue speeding fines and endorsements. I have today 
 spoken to PC Palfrey and he assures me that things will be happening in the 
 near future. Our MP has requested a meeting in September to discuss the 
 speeding problem on Cirencester Road and I have suggested we await the results 
 of the speed checks before such a meeting is confirmed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The rest of the past month has been taken up by the MUGA 
 installation problems as is evidenced by the numerous emails I have been 
 sending. The problems are being attended to and it is hoped that the 
 installation will be completed satisfactorily by the end of the week. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">CERNEY NEWS CONTRIBUTIONS </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Request those residents interested in gaining an allotment 
 space to contact Bruton Knowles. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Ask for volunteers to join the working party to enhance 
 road safety throughout the village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">To advise all residents who have hedges and shrubs growing 
 out on to pavements or the highway to maintain them in such a way that they 
 don’t hinder the users thereof. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Remind residents that the WoW (Walk on Wednesdays) 
 initiative in conjunction with Ann Edwards School has been organised for 
 Wednesday 10th September from 8.45–9.15am. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 9.50pm.</p>
