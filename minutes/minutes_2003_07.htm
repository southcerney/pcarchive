    <td>The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Bennett (CDC), Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) and Cllr Parsons
    (GCC).<br>
    <br>
    Eight young male members of the village were welcomed to the meeting by the Chairman. The
    Chairman and assembled Councillors welcomed the return of the Clerk after his recent
    illness. The Clerk then thanked all those who had sent him get well messages during his
    stay in hospital.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 11 JUNE 2003</strong><br>
    Item Aircraft Noise: 5th line ­ delete ... Friday and ... insert &quot;to Saturday
    inclusive&quot;<br>
    Item Quality Council: 1st line ­ delete ... Councils ... insert &quot;Councillors&quot;;
    delete &quot;unanimously&quot; in last line. Cllr Nicholas wished that it be recorded that
    he had registered profound reservations on South Cerney becoming a Quality Council.<br>
    Page 6: 2nd full paragraph 1st line ­ delete ... wet ... insert &quot;clay&quot;. It was
    proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Minutes as altered were a true
    and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were signed by
    the Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>YOUTH DEPUTATION</strong><br>
    The Chairman adjourned the meeting and invited a representative from the youth delegation
    to make a statement. Their spokesperson André Genillard thanked the Parish Council for
    the new facilities it had created on the Upper Up playing fields which would give the
    youth of the village a much needed amenity. Cllr Harris reminded the Parish Council that
    the idea for the scheme had originally been conceived after the Parish Council had
    received a letter from André Genillard asking for some sort of activity area to be
    provided for the village youth. Cllr Harris asked that the group through common sense
    ownership look after the facilities. The young men then left the meeting and the Chairman
    proceeded to Matters Arising.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Jubilee Gardens</strong><br>
    The Chairman circulated a series of photographs depicting the condition of the public open
    space at Jubilee Gardens that showed the unacceptable condition in which the developers
    had left the site. Cllr Nicholas commented that this was just not good enough and action
    must be taken to restore the site to useful public open space. The Clerk had ascertained
    from Martin Hutchings, Development Officer at CDC that he would be favourably inclined to
    negotiate on the ground maintenance of the area with the Parish Council.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Jay that Cllr Nicholas assisted by the
    Clerk negotiate an agreement to maintain the area. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Ramp</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart arranged with M. Portus (Whitton Associates) to provide a quotation and plan
    to modify the existing ramp for use by disabled carriages and to link the top of the ramp
    to the car park. Cllr Jay remarked that it would be safer to provide a path inside the
    playing field than alongside the carriageway.<br>
    <strong>Golf Balls</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire had spoken to Mr Franklin who informed him of a visit he had from the Health
    and Safety Executive which recommended that a new warning sign be installed at the 2nd
    tee.<br>
    <strong>Flower Tubs</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that M. Chamberlain no longer made tubs. The Clerk was asked to
    contact GCC Highways to find out what progress had been made on the promised traffic
    calming feasibility study at village gateways and to suggest that flower tubs could be
    incorporated in a final scheme.<br>
    <strong>Aircraft Noise</strong><br>
    A letter had been received from Mr Ingram withdrawing his objections to the aircraft
    noise. A further four letters had been received objecting or continuing to argue that the
    Parish Council complain about the noise to those responsible. Cllr Nicholas reported that
    the discussion was being debated on the web site and recommended that the letter written
    to Maj Jones Acting Commanding Officer at 29 Regt RLC be published on the web site.<br>
    Quality Council<br>
    Cllr Stuart outlined the wider implications which might arise if the Parish Council
    attained Quality Status. A watching brief would be kept on developments and meanwhile the
    Clerk was asked to proceed with an application for Quality Status.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 7
    July.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Jet Ski Lake at Ashton Keynes</strong><br>
    Information from Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) on proposed jet ski lake at Ashton Keynes was
    awaited. The Clerk was asked to enquire from Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) if there were any
    further developments.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning application received by Gloucestershire County Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.2648/2/K Planning Ref 3759/PATS (temporary ref)</strong><br>
    Non-compliance with condition 1 of consent CT.2648/2/K and variation of that condition to
    extend the time in which to commence development on land at Cerney Wick Farm, Ashton
    Keynes, Glos.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.0006/3/N</strong><br>
    Erection of conservatory to existing dwelling at 30 The Limes, South Cerney, Glos<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.0144/4/R</strong><br>
    Erection of one (1) dwelling at Hailwood, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    The Committee was of the opinion that the design was incongruous and not in the prevailing
    local style.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.0776/Q</strong><br>
    Amendment to erection of detached dwelling on land adjacent to Walnut Tree Farmhouse,
    Upper Up, South Cerney, Glos (R)<br>
    Objection, similar to the original application, was maintained to this amendment. The
    proposed new vehicular access is on a dangerous bend. The drawings do not take account of
    the fact that there is now a high stone wall on the inside of that entire bend. The
    proposed position of the dwelling is too close to the existing cottages immediately to the
    east of the site.<br>
    OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.1454/3/X</strong><br>
    Erection of office and storage building at Watermark, Station Road, South Cerney, Glos<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.4498/W</strong><br>
    Hotel, leisure club, restaurant and staff accommodation at Lake 6, Cotswold Water Park,
    South Cerney<br>
    The Committee agreed that the scheme was too large a development for the site. A three
    storey building would be detrimental to the visual amenity of the rural location. There
    was insufficient information on materials to be used in the construction of the walls and
    roof. A development of this enormous proportion would overload the local sewerage
    infrastructure. The site plan was out of date and consequently misleading.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.4511/F</strong><br>
    Erection of new dwelling and associated works at Tien House, Cerney Wick, Cirencester,
    Glos<br>
    The proposed dwelling would extend the built environment<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.5189/G</strong><br>
    Residential gypsy caravan site; access road; 17 hardstandings and temporary cesspools plus
    low level lighting on land adjacent to Sewage Works, South Cerney Road, Cirencester. Glos
    (R)<br>
    It was agreed to maintain the objection of the Parish Council<br>
    OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.5804/T</strong><br>
    Additional domestic and technical accommodation at Duke of Gloucester Barracks, South
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    (R)=Ratification<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the above deliberations and to ratify the decisions of the Planning
    Committee on those applications which it determined. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.0006/3/M</strong><br>
    Erection of conservatory and first floor side extension to existing dwelling at 1
    Kingfisher Place, South Cerney, Glos<br>
    Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest and took no part in the debate on this
    application.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman explained the Committee's deliberation on this application.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agrees to
    accept the decision of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning applications granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.0649/1/Z</strong><br>
    Minor amendment approval to revision to extension roof at jointing point with main
    dwelling at 13 Meadow Way, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 6HY<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.0144/4/Q</strong><br>
    Erection of side extension and front porch to existing dwelling at 7 Robert Franklin Way,
    South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5UD<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT1454/3/W</strong><br>
    Retrospective permission for a velux rooflight and two shuttered windows in rear elevation
    (shutters to match external cladding) at 71 Isis Lakes, Spine Road, South Cerney,
    Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5TL<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.2533/K</strong><br>
    Erection of conservatory to side elevation at 4 Huxley Court, South Cerney, Cirencester,
    Glos. GL7 5XF<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.3887/2/X</strong><br>
    Erection of a two storey side extension and conservatory to rear at 24 Field Close, South
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5XQ<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.3929/Q</strong><br>
    First floor bedroom and bedroom en-suite extension above existing single storey extension
    at 15 Willow Grove, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5UU<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.4067/2/K</strong><br>
    Single storey rear kitchen extension at 27 Oak Way, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7
    5XX<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.8302</strong><br>
    Two storey extension to side and single storey extension to rear at 8 Broadway Lane, South
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5UH<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning application refused by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.2003/R</strong><br>
    <strong>Erection of detached dwelling on land at School Lane, South Cerney, Cirencester,
    Glos.</strong><br>
    The application site is located prominently within South Cerney Conservation Area, wherein
    the Local Planning Authority must have regard to the desirability of preserving or
    enhancing its character or appearance. The dwelling proposed is considered to have an
    adverse effect on the character and appearance of that part of the Conservation Area by
    virtue of its contrived siting, which would detract from the openness of the site, which
    is important to the setting of the historic school building. The erection of a dwelling
    within this space would appear cramped and out of keeping with the general pattern of
    development within that part of the Conservation Area, which historically has comprised of
    buildings sited either on or adjacent to the roadside. Furthermore, the detailed design of
    the dwelling would appear self-conscious and contrived.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CT.7318/D Mill Cottage, Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman had informed the Enforcement Officer at CDC that in her opinion the new
    construction at Mill Cottage did not adhere to the granted planning application. The
    Enforcement Officer had agreed to inspect the building.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on 7 July.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up Park</strong><br>
    The Clerk pointed out that if the proposed payment for work at Upper Up was agreed the
    project will exceed its budget by approximately £2,600. Cllr Jay remarked that part of
    the over run could be attributed to the extra costs incurred when it became necessary to
    re-tender for the project. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Stuart that
    the Parish Council agrees to release £3,000 from its Capital Reserve to fund additional
    work at the Upper Up Park. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Churchyard Wall Extension</strong><br>
    The Parish Council agrees with the policy of the previous Parish Council which was
    favourably minded to await a grant application from the PCC for the churchyard wall
    extension.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Court Fees</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that a claim was issued on 16 June 2003. The Court sent it to the
    defendant by first class post on 17 June and it was deemed to be served on 19 June. The
    defendant, Robert Hewer, had until 3 July to reply. As no reply had been received the
    court had been asked to enter judgment.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd</strong><br>
    The Parish Council was concerned that the quality of grass cutting in parts of the village
    was unsatisfactory. The Clerk was to ask that invoices for ground maintenance be more
    specific detailing when and where the cuts were made. The Clerk had arranged for a
    representative of the contractors to attend the next meeting of the Playing Fields and
    Village Maintenance committee on 11 August with an explanation.<br>

    Village Hall Committee respectfully. Cllr Harris also declared a prejudicial interest. It
    was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council
    agrees to make the above payments. With the exception of Cllrs Harris, Jay and Stuart who
    abstained the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Internal Audit</strong><br>
    Mrs J. A. Gardiner had carried out the Internal Audit copies of which had been passed to
    all Parish Councillors. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr Nicholas
    that the Parish Council approves the Statement of Assurance. The Parish Council was all in
    favour. It was further proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish
    Council approves the Balance sheet was a true and proper record. The Parish Council was
    all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Maintenance Quotations</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest and took no part in the debate. Two quotations
    had been received for ground maintenance at Robert Franklin Way playing field. It was
    proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Squire that the Parish Council accepts the
    cheaper quotation from R. O.W. Berry for the work. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 7 July.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Litter Picker</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart outlined problem areas in the village prone to litter accumulation and
    suggested that the Parish Council considers employing a litter picker. Cllr Jay was more
    specific and recommended that the Parish Council employs a street cleaner. The Parish
    Council agreed in principle that a cleaner should be sought. Cllr Stuart volunteered to
    approach Mr E. Curtis for this task and report his findings at the next meeting. The Clerk
    was asked to find out how often street cleaning was performed in the village by SITA.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up Playing Fields</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported many instances of vandalism at the Upper Up playing fields including
    collecting broken bottles from in and around the children's play equipment. He asked the
    Clerk to inform Sgt McIntyre Glos Constabulary and ask him to arrange for a patrol to
    visit the area on Friday and Saturday evenings.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way Playing Field</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that nettles were 18-24 inches high around the play bark area and it
    was becoming impossible to access the litter bins because of this. He recommended that the
    weeds needed to be sprayed in the near future. Cllr Harris offered to spray the nettles
    for £50. It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish
    Council agrees to James Harris Contracting spraying the weeds for £50. The Parish Council
    was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Cerney Wick Play Area</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the fence on the right hand side of the field was broken.
    The litter bin needed to be emptied. Bushes coming through the fence needed to be cut back
    and the front hedge bordering the road also needed to be cut back. Cllr Caunce reported
    that the bin outside the Crown Inn also needed to be emptied.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Reporting Procedures</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to redesign the report forms creating one monthly form for each of the
    three sites.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Contingency Fund</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire recommended that the Parish Council consider approving a contingency allowance
    of up to £200 to alleviate any emergency situation which might arise. Cllr Stuart
    proposed and Cllr Jay seconded a motion that an allowance of up to £200 under the control
    of the Committee with a minimum of two Parish Councillors to consent its use in each
    emergency be agreed.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bus Shelter at Limes</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that vandals had removed a part of the gutter to the front of the bus
    shelter. The Clerk would arrange quotations for its repair.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Tree Work</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart declared an interest and withdrew from the debate. The Committee had no
    objection to the intention to undertake the felling of three self-seeded sycamores at Well
    Cottage, Upper Up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>War Memorial</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that the chain ties at the war memorial needed to be replaced. The
    Clerk would arrange quotations for its repair.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ditch in Station Road</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the ditch in Station Road was silting up and would need
    clearing. Cllr Harris volunteered to investigate the silt level and reported that there
    was approximately 3 inches of silt at the outflow. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and
    seconded by Cllr Harris to cut the herbage in late autumn and remove cut material. Silting
    would be monitored throughout the year. With the exception of Cllr Mrs Chubb who abstained
    the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
