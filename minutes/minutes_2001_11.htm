    </center></div><p align="left">Prior to the start of the meeting Caroline Edwards from
    GRCC gave a presentation on the Vital Villages Programme. The Programme is divided into
    three distinct initiatives:<br>
    1. Parish Transport Grant; <br>
    2. Community Services Grant;<br>
    3. Parish Plan Grant.<br>
    Ms Edwards briefly outlined the objectives of each initiative and how the grants could be
    applied for. She concentrated on the Parish Plan grant scheme which allowed the Parish
    Council to take the lead. There was a grant of up to £5,000 available but proof of a
    local community need would be required. One Parish Council in Gloucestershire had made a
    successful application but many more were in various stages of applying. Cllr Mrs Clark
    (CDC) informed the Parish Council that a Ward Grant could be available to set up a web
    site and Cllr Nicholas would contact Natasha McKenna for an application form. Ms Edwards
    left copies of her slide presentation for information. Parish Councillors decided to
    discuss the implications of the programme at their next meeting in December.<br>
    <br>
    The Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner opened the meeting at 7.35pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    There was an apology from Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING</strong><br>
    Page 1 ­ Village Floods ­ 2nd paragraph 2nd sentence ­ change ... would ...<br>
    work<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Minutes as amended
    were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council agreed unanimously and the Minutes
    were signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village Floods</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner read a letter from Mrs Robinson querying the implications of the weir
    which had been erected near the bridge in Clarks Hay. The Clerk was asked to copy the
    letter to the Environment Agency and Mr Rob Bull, Flood Co-ordinator at CDC with a
    covering letter expressing the concerns of the Parish Council. Cllr Jones (CDC) informed
    the Parish Council that the sluice gate in School Lane was now completed and that Thames
    Water had checked out all the pumping stations. Thames Water had also installed 20 flow
    monitors, 18 in the Cirencester area and two in South Cerney. All the CCTV surveys had
    been completed and were now awaiting analysis.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hunter Page Planning Meeting</strong><br>
    A meeting attended by Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart with Paul Fong and
    Guy Wakefield of HPP on 18 October discussed the possibilities of the provision of a new
    community centre and the implications of affordable housing on the development. Following
    that meeting Cllr Nicholas reported that Westbury Homes was in favour of appointing an
    independent consultant to act jointly for South Cerney Parish Council and themselves at no
    cost to the Parish Council. Cllr Mrs Spriggs queried the necessity of engaging
    professional advisors but Cllr Nicholas replied that this advice would enable the Parish
    Council to properly comment on any planning application especially regarding the issue of
    the affordable housing element. Cllr Mrs Spriggs was concerned and uneasy with becoming
    involved with Westbury Homes. Cllr Jones (CDC) said that the local planning authority
    would produce a formula to calculate the ratio of affordable housing for the rest of the
    development. After a vote the Parish Council agreed with 6 in favour and 3 abstentions to
    invite Westbury Homes to instruct such advisors. Cllr Nicholas reported that Mr Davison
    and Ms Hague developers for Hampshire County Council would be prepared to provide advice
    and strategy for a fee of £3,000 to £5,000 to protect the interests of the Parish
    Council in dealing with Westbury Homes over the provision of a new community centre. Cllr
    Nicholas explained that the fee quoted was to conclusion of business but if for any reason
    the scheme failed to mature then the fee would reflect this. It was agreed that until the
    plans were approved there would be no commitment on behalf of the Parish Council and any
    payment would be on a conditional fee arrangement. Before these consultants were engaged
    it would be necessary to ask Hampshire County Council for an accreditation. A further
    meeting with HPP had been arranged for 22 November to which CDC Ward Councillors Mrs Clark
    and Dr Jones had been invited. Cllr Jones (CDC) did not agree in principle of engaging
    with developers and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would seek legal advice on whether to attend. If
    and when an application was presented both councillors would consider attending a meeting
    then. The Clerk was asked to invite CDC planning officers to attend the meeting scheduled
    for 22 November with HPP.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way play area Sub-Committee</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas would arrange a meeting of the action group to form a Sub-Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 5
    November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Best Value Review</strong><br>
    Blockley Parish Council had pointed out that under the Town &amp; Country Planning Act
    1990 Parish Councils could formally instruct CDC that they wished to become a consultee in
    the planning process. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that
    the Parish Council formally write to CDC to consult the Parish Council under the terms of
    the above quoted Act.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/M<br>
    Minor amendment to formation of bathroom off bedroom 2 at Crane Farm, South Cerney,
    Cirencester. Minor amendment relates to the installation of a three-light first floor
    window, in place of the previously approved two-light window in the east elevation<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/Q<br>
    Removal of the existing conservatory and provision of new, together with formation of two
    small new windows, one on landing and the other to the master bedroom at Crane Farm, South
    Cerney, Cirencester Cllr Nicholas asked that this decision be ratified as the Committee
    did not have the benefit of the Parish Council's input due to the time restraint imposed.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.2648/2/X<br>
    Amendment to application for full planning permission for the erection of 40 semi-detached
    holiday lodges, extension and refurbishment of the clubhouse, fishing and continued
    leisure and fishing use of the lake, landscaping, provision of car parking, construction
    of new access at Lake 10, Cotswold Water Park, Cerney Wick Lane, South Cerney, Glos. The
    consensus of the Village Appraisal is that &quot;enough is enough&quot;. The proposed
    amended new entrance is still dangerous. A clear enforceable occupancy restriction should
    be imposed, for example a uniform closed period during the &quot;off season&quot;. The
    proposed construction hours should be reduced to starting at 8am and finishing no later
    than 6pm Monday to Friday. The application is incompatible with the principles of Zone B
    criteria. If permission granted Conditions thereof should include:<br>
    ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a contribution to the proposed cycle track/footpath along adjacent
    Spine Road;<br>
    ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new access from site to disused railway line;<br>
    ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upgrade existing bridleway on disused railway line from Lake 75 to
    South Cerney to provide a sustainable means of transport e.g. cycle track and/or footpath.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.2781/N<br>
    Conversion of 2 (two) ground floor shops and 2 (two) first floor flats into 3 (three)
    dwellings at The Village Stores, Clarks Hay, South Cerney Parish Council agreed that if
    permission was granted then a Condition be imposed that parking is provided for all
    vehicles associated with the dwelling.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4073/D<br>
    Change of use to match fishing and specimen lakes together with erection of associated
    clubhouse at Lake 15, Spine Road, South Cerney The Parish Council does not object to the
    change of use. The Parish Council objects to the erection of a two (2) storey clubhouse in
    such a prominent position and question the need for residential use. The Parish Council
    also objects to the siting of caravans as they would have a detrimental effect on the
    visual impact within the area.<br>
    OBJECT<br>
    <br>
    CT.6074/P<br>
    Two storey extension to the existing dwelling at Riverside Cottage, School Lane, South
    Cerney Cllr Nicholas asked that this decision be ratified as the Committee did not have
    the benefit of the Parish Council's input due to the time restraint imposed.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.6074/Q<br>
    Two storey extension to the existing dwelling at Riverside Cottage, School Lane, South
    Cerney (listed building/conservation area consent)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8163/B<br>
    Amendment to application for erection of 2 (two) detached two storey dwellings at Orchard
    House, Upper Up, South Cerney The size of the development would be alien to the area. Two
    very large houses in such close proximity to other adjoining dwellings would be
    detrimental to the overall visual amenity of the Conservation Area. Houses of this size
    would probably have several vehicles associated with each of them potentially causing high
    vehicle movement. Far too many mature trees would have to be destroyed.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to ratify the decisions
    taken on applications CT.1454/3/Q and CT.6074/P. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>

    Porch extension to existing lodge at 61 Isis Lakes, Spine Road, Cotswold Water Park, South

    as Orchard House; Condition 6 notwithstanding the submitted plans, the new dormer window
    of the north elevation shall be fitted using obscured glazing and shall be permanently
    fitted with obscured glazing and shall be maintained as such thereafter.<br>

    Application to undertake tree work at Rowan House, The Langet, South Cerney. Various works
    as per notification.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>

    <strong>Tree Work in Conservation Area</strong><br>
    The Committee recommends that discussion on the notification of tree work in the
    Conservation Area be transferred to the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields Committee
    for its deliberation. Cllr Harris agreed and the Parish Council would amend its procedure
    on a temporary basis until the next Parish Council elections.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br>
    A reply had been received from Mr C. J. Vickery Forward Planning Manager at CDC on the
    impact of the Local Plan Review on development in South Cerney. Of particular interest was
    his assertion that the CAMAS site is considered an area of mineral extraction where
    provision has been made for restoration through a planning condition. The Clerk was to
    request a copy of the relevant application.<br>
    <br>
    A419/A417 Route Management Strategy<br>
    Cllr Parsons (GCC) referred to a pamphlet and questionnaire outlining the strategy on this
    trunk route through Gloucestershire. He was disappointed that no mention had been made of
    the &quot;missing link&quot; at Nettleton Bottom. A public exhibition had been arranged
    locally at Kingshill School, Cirencester for 10 November.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on
    5 November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>District Audit</strong><br>
    Iain Selkirk District Auditor informed the Parish Council that the Village Hall and Upper
    Up playing fields were community assets which cannot be sold by the Parish Council.
    Consequently a nominal value of £1 should be put on them but they should still be
    disclosed as Parish Council assets. An audited report of the accounts had been returned
    identifying issues arising from the audit. The auditor was pleased to report that the
    records had been well maintained during the year. One or two minor amendments were
    requested to the supporting statement to the accounts which had now been satisfactorily
    completed. Other matters of a minor nature were also discussed with the Clerk.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Disabled Access</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Dunn that the Parish Council
    approves that work commences on the construction of the disabled access. The Parish
    Council was all in favour. The Clerk was asked to notify T. Sibbick.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ditch Clearance in Station Road</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Spriggs and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council
    approves the quote from Mr Timbrell for £700 to dig out the ditch in Station Road. The
    Parish Council was all in favour. The Clerk was asked to notify Mr Timbrell. The grant
    from GCC Highways of £300 towards the cost was most welcome.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Weeping Willow in Meadow Way</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest and withdrew from the discussion. It was proposed by Cllr
    Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council approves the quote from
    Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd for £160 to cut back the weeping willow in Meadow Way.
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <strong>Remembrance Day</strong><br>
    Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner agreed to use the remaining £50 of her Chairperson¹s
    Allowance as a donation to the Royal British Legion.<br>

    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 5 November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Disabled Access at Upper Up</strong><br>
    The Committee recommended that the Parish Council agrees to instruct T. Sibbick to proceed
    with the contract to erect the disabled access at Upper Up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CCTV Survey</strong><br>
    David Green of Three Counties Drainage Services informed the Clerk that he would carry out
    a CCTV survey of the culvert in High Street in the coming week. Derek Taylor of GCC
    Highways was awaiting his call to open the relevant manholes for access.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lines on Basketball area at Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Ermin Toolhire was now able to supply the equipment needed to
    paint the lines on the basketball area and that he would organise the work.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Litter</strong><br>
    Mr E. Curtis who had been approached by Cllr Stuart was in agreement to pick up litter
    within the village. The Committee recommended that the Parish Council offered him £5 for
    one hour per week. Cllr Mrs Pearse said that there were numerous residents who carried out
    this task voluntarily and queried the necessity of paying someone. Cllr Harris replied
    that litter was a continuing nuisance on the playing fields. After some discussion the
    Parish Council decided not to pursue paying anyone for litter collection.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Drain Cleaning</strong><br>
    A written quote for £700 plus VAT had now been received from Mr Timbrell to dig out the
    open drain in Station Road. The Committee was all in favour and recommended that the
    Parish Council agrees. GCC Highways which had offered a donation of £300 towards the cost
    was most welcome.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Mole Clearance</strong><br>
    Able Pest Control Services had completed the mole clearance of the playing field at Upper
    Up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bus Shelter Repair</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner would remind Mr Clive Symcox that work on the repairs he had quoted for had
    not yet been carried out.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ditch in Station Road</strong><br>
    The Clerk was to ask Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd to strim the ditch when they next
    carried out grass maintenance in the village, preferably prior to it being dug out.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hedge at Cerney Wick play area</strong><br>
    Mr Taffinder had agreed for the Parish Council to arrange the cutting back of the
    pyracantha hedge at Cerney Wick playing field and for the rails of the fence to be
    positioned on the playground side. The Clerk was to contact Ian Fairbrother, Chairman of
    the Cerney Wick Village Committee to enquire if he requires that the hedge be cut back
    further before he undertakes the fence repair. Cllr Harris would contact Mr Fairbrother to
    arrange the repair.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Inspection Report</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart carried out the playground inspections. Cllr Harris gave his report. Smashed
    glass had been found on the basketball court at Upper Up playing fields and the Clerk was
    asked to inform the police. Cllr Gardiner would be responsible for carrying out the
    inspections for the coming month<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MILLENNIUM PARK</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Martin Portus was awaiting a response from Mr Bergin of the
    Environment Agency regarding objections to the proposed building of the Millennium Park on
    the flood plain. Plans for a skate boarding scheme have had to be withdrawn because the
    area of concrete needed was too large to accommodate in the plan.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Westbury Homes</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris requested that Mr Bachus, Site Manager at the Limes, be asked what the
    intentions were for the eastern end of the original boundary wall fronting the development
    on Station Road. If it was determined that it was part of the developers responsibility it
    should be left in a more tidy condition. A manhole cover had worked loose opposite the
    entrance to Westbury Homes and the Clerk was asked to inform GCC Highways.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bledisloe Cup</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Clerk that he had received two invitations to the award
    presentations for the Village of the Year competition to be held in London on 5 December.
    Cllr Stuart volunteered to attend the presentation and suggested that the Parish Council
    considers asking either Peter Jay or Raymond Fenton to attend as they had both put in a
    tremendous amount of effort in preparing for the presentation which had been held in the
    Village Hall on 25 October. After a short debate it was agreed that Cllr Harris would
    accompany Cllr Stuart to the presentation. Cllr Mrs Gardiner on behalf of the Parish
    Council thanked Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart for making their presentations to the panel.
    Cllr Nicholas proposed and Cllr Dunn seconded this and the Parish Council was all in
    favour. Cllr Mrs Gardiner proposed and Cllr Gardiner seconded that the Parish Council
    agrees to pay for their travel and expenses for attending the presentation. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Golden Jubilee</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Capt Ian Cheeseman, Welfare Officer at 29 Rgt The Royal Logistic
    Corps had made enquiries to join with the village in celebrating the Queen's Golden
    Jubilee. He had proposed to erect a beacon on the airfield and hold a village picnic
    there. This would be discussed at next month's meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>2 Willow Grove</strong><br>
    A resident had reported to Cllr Mrs Chubb that the leylandii hedge outside 2 Willow Grove
    was obstructing the sight line for vehicles joining Station Road. The Clerk was asked to
    write to the occupier to cut back the offending hedge.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>War Memorial</strong> <br>
    Cllr Gardiner had tidied up the War Memorial in preparation for the Remembrance Sunday
    parade on 11 November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lime Tree in Silver Street</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner received a request from Mr D. Walters, a resident living opposite the
