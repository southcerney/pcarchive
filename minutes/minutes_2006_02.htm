    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 8th February 2006</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart 
    welcomed Mrs H. Jones, Gloucestershire Youth Service Representative and Mrs 
    Janet Lodge South Cerney Youth Club Leader to the meeting. He congratulated 
    Helen Jones on her recent marriage. Cllr Stuart stated that the only way 
    forward due to lack of funds was in partnership i.e. the Glos Youth Service, 
    the Youth Club, the Church and the Parish Council. Mrs Jones informed the 
    meeting that a specially equipped van should be available around Easter. 
    Equipment would consist of a laptop computer, lots of advice leaflets and 
    educational games. It would be in the area for one day a week during the 
    summer holidays which were scheduled for 21st July until 4th September. Mrs 
    Jones offered to work with partners in applying for grant funding. Cllr 
    Caunce enquired what were the identified priorities. Mrs Jones replied that 
    there was a need to work with a small core group of youths who would be 
    representative of most of the 300 youth residents in the village. Another 
    scheme might be the provision of a youth shelter or shelters. Cllr Caunce 
    persisted and asked what else? In the short term Mrs Jones said that summer 
    activities would be encouraged. She agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Caunce 
    that a “taster” session with the new van would be useful during the half 
    term break before the summer holidays. Further questioning by Cllr Caunce 
    determined that long term aspirations are the provision of youth shelters, 
    trips out, transport to cinemas by local bus or dial-a-ride, paint balling 
    although this was very expensive, ice skating and ten pin bowling were all 
    possibilities. Cllr Jay added that there was a huge number of children 
    locally who were not involved. Janet Lodge agreed and said that the average 
    attendance at the Youth Club was around 20, for which she was comfortably 
    able to cater. Cllr Jay said that the Gloucestershire Youth Service was 
    letting our children down. A discussion then followed on how best to 
    encourage the youth to participate. Mrs Jones rejected an idea that a list 
    of activities be put forward. She argued that the youth should be given a 
    blank sheet as they had some very innovative ideas. Cllr Caunce suggested 
    that we should support or sponsor a degree student on a PhD course and use 
    the resulting thesis as the basis of a future plan. He continued that we 
    needed a plan to go forward and asked if money would help? Janet Lodge 
    answered: “Not really.” As children were flexible with their needs changing 
    very quickly, any plan must also be flexible. Cllr Jay agreed that needs 
    must be identified. He considered the Youth Council idea a plus and it could 
    help promote the van project. Cllr Smith stated that he was very confused 
    with the debate so far and asked Mrs Jones what could the Gloucestershire 
    Youth Service offer? Mrs Jones repeated her reply that she could support 
    funding grants and supply a van. A question was asked how much a youth 
    worker would cost? Mrs Jones replied that an unqualified worker would cost 
    £1,500 for 46 weeks a year at 3 hours per session although a minimum of two 
    workers would be needed. Cllr Stuart concluded the debate by saying that the 
    way forward was to use our best endeavours to get the Youth Council up and 
    running and thanked Mrs Jones for her attendance. Mrs H. Jones and Mrs J. 
    Lodge left the meeting at 7.38pm.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO Transport</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart read a reply from Inspector Jacka, Cirencester Police, to the 
 Parish Council’s suggestion that PCSO Yeomans use public transport to convey 
 him to South Cerney. Inspector Jacka had stated that the situation was being 
 addressed in the light of Health and Safety considerations. Cllr Squire 
 informed the Council that Inspector Jacka had very recently retired and asked 
 the Clerk to welcome his replacement Inspector Steven Williams and ask him what 
 progress had been made in resolving the transport problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chestnut Tree, Clarks Hay</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay enquired if a reply had been received from Matt Reid CDC Tree Officer 
 about the work which had been done in the vicinity of the tree in Chestnut 
 Mews. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would enquire and report.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 18th January I attended a meeting in the 
 Village Hall to discuss the setting up of a Youth Council. Present included 
 Cllr Stuart, Clair Dowan, CDC Youth Participation Officer and her line manager 
 Rose Marie Lynn. Five interested local youths namely: Joe Lodge, Simon Carter, 
 Thomas Nicholas, Sebastian Genillard and Sandy Stewart were also in attendance. 
 Clare Dowan discussed the possible structure of a Youth Council and outlined 
 some objectives which she thought would be of interest. It was agreed that a 
 further meeting be organised for 6.30pm Tuesday 21st February when hopefully 
 those present might persuade others to come along.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 31st January Cllr Stuart, Cllr Nicholas and 
 myself met Jo Elliott of the Land Registry who explained the necessary 
 procedures to register the Parish Council’s land holdings and Village Hall. 
 Unregistered titles could be divided into three distinct sections: (a) Upper Up 
 playing fields (b) the Village Hall, and (c) others including the Piece. Steps 
 will now be taken to register these assets.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Following on from the successful publication of the 
 Village Plan and its distribution through Cerney News I propose to make it an 
 item on next month’s agenda. So far I have had only one enquiry and that was 
 forwarded to Cllr Caunce as it pertained to traffic calming. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During January over the 21 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 25 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CHAIRMAN’S REPORT </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart suggested changes to the format of the Parish 
 Council agenda and its meeting based on discussions he had at a seminar he 
 recently attended. Parish Councillors generally were not in favour of too 
 radical a change and discounted any restriction to the length of time taken to 
 discuss an item. Cllr Nicholas said that if a contentious item was discussed 
 which was not on the agenda then there could be no resolution and no decision. 
 Parish Councillors were in favour of shortening the time taken with the 
 Committee reports but insisted that Councillors’ Reports remain.</p>

 plate. The Clerk reported that he had been in contact with Steve Griffiths who 
 informed him that Technix Rubber Ltd (Southampton) had supplied the honey 
 combed safety surface. The Clerk was awaiting a response from Julie Tegg, GPFA 
 regarding his query if she was aware of any other reported incidences with this 
 type of surface. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reported no problems on the Upper Up play area although he

 Variation of conditions 4 and 10 of CT.2648/3/A to enable dry working at Cerney 
 Wick Farm Quarry, Cerney Wick (R) <br>
 South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council objects to the application for 
 variation of conditions 4 &amp; 10 of planning permission CT.2648/3/A to enable dry 
 working, for the following reasons: <br>
 Many of the issues and concerns expressed by Gavin Jones, GCC Principal 
 Planning Officer, in his letter of 20th May 2005 do not appear to have been 
 addressed in the Hills Environmental Statement. In particular, no account is 
 taken of what would happen if the proposed balancing pond/lagoon system did not 
 in fact protect the level of the water table at the eastern end of the site, 
 close to North Meadow. <br>
 The Environmental Statement makes no reference to the likely effect of dry 
 working on the river Churn water levels and flows. This would have considerable 
 implications for the water table level in the locality. <br>
 There should be a condition requiring the applicant to finish working the 
 Dryleaze Farm extension to Shorncote Quarry before they commence workings at 
 Cerney Wick Farm, including full completion of landscaping. <br>
 Condition 24 of the extant permission should be emphasised, to impose stringent 
 requirements for wheel washing in order to prevent the current serious problem 
 of mud on the Spine Road. The Parish Council is concerned that all traffic 
 accessing the site, at every stage of the development, should only do so direct 
 from the Spine Road, to avoid having to travel along any of the lanes around 
 Cerney Wick. <br>
 The Parish Council is also concerned about dust from the site, since 
 realistically the proposals in paragraph 6.16 (page 6) of the Environmental 
 Statement may well not be enforced. Concern is also expressed about the loss of 
 public footpaths across the site. <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart described the chaos experienced on the 18th 
 January by residents in Robert Franklin Way and Station Road when the sewerage 
 pipe fractured again. Repairs were carried out very quickly but he considered 
 that the work was not coordinated. In future, he insisted, when the next break 
 occurs someone must appear to take command. Cllr Squire volunteered to attend a 
 meeting arranged by Chris Orphanides for 10.30am on 24th February in the 
 Village Hall to discuss the offensive sewage odour with a representative from 
 Thames Water and Hilary Beech CDC Environmental Health Officer. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Stuart who stated that 
 the CDC Environmental Health Officer should monitor the clean up of the sewage. 
 Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) volunteered to contact Ralph Young, Head of Environmental 
 Health at CDC and report back. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that Mr Ray Jenkins from Watermark 
 had informed him that sewage in its private system was being pumped but there 
 was uncertainty of where it was going.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>2nd HOMES COUNCIL TAX FUND </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had asked Les Haines (CDC) to ear-mark money 
 for a youth shelter from the Crime Reduction fund. Cllr Squire had met with Les 
 Haines who had no recollection of such an arrangement although it was possible 
 that a grant of £2,000 may be available for a youth shelter. Cllr Stuart 
 suggested that it might be possible to convert the shelter at the tennis court 
 within a budget of £2,000. Cllr Harris was opposed to the idea that a youth 
 shelter be sited on Robert Franklin Way play area as he considered it an 
 unsuitable location. Anywhere such a shelter was proposed must be sensitively 
 sited so that residents in its vicinity were not upset. Cllr Stuart disagreed, 
 and argued that the positioning of a shelter within sight of residential 
 property was a necessity. Cllr Stuart had spoken with George Taylor on the cost 
 of supplying a MUGA (Multi User Games Area). Depending on its size and which 
 units were required the cost would be approximately £15,000 for a 10 x 15m with 
 units at one end or alternatively £30,000 for a 30 x 10m with units at either 
 end. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the Parish Council applies for the larger grant of £30,000. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire and the Clerk would formulate a proposition 
 for a grant to provide a MUGA for presentation to the 2nd Homes Council Tax 
 Fund.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire will circulate a report of a meeting he 
 attended at CDC on 7th February. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire asked the Clerk to request Talland Riding 
 School on Cirencester Road not to leave black plastic rubbish bags on the verge 
 outside its premises over a weekend. Animals are raiding such sacks and the 
 resulting mess is being scattered along the adjacent carriageway. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire asked Cllr Parsons (GCC) to enquire from John 
 Whittaker GCC Highways when the change of speed limits on Cirencester Road, the 
 interactive speed warning signs and the crossing in High Street might be 
 completed. Cllr Parsons (GCC) agreed to make enquiries.<p class="MsoNormal">
 Cllr Jay asked that the damage to the bridge parapet over the river Churn in 
 Clarks Hay be reported. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) volunteered to make the necessary 
 enquiries. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay observed that crossing the Spine Road to the 
 Cotswold Outdoor centre was extremely hazardous for pedestrians and was 
 convinced that it was only a matter of time before a serious accident occurred 
 there. It had been suggested that the underpass be used to traverse the road 
 but this was unsatisfactory as it was flooded more often than not. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that the South Cerney Trust had agreed 
 to supply a picnic table for the play area in Cerney Wick. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay complained that no action to repair the stile at 
 Boxbush bridge or the footpath sign had yet been made. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to request Zycko Ltd, Broadway 
 Lane not to leave black plastic rubbish bags on the verge outside its premises 
 over a weekend. Animals are raiding such sacks and the resulting mess is being 
 scattered along the adjacent carriageway. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb asked if any reply had been forthcoming from 
 Avent regarding the damage to Jim Parker’s tree. As none had been received the 
 Clerk was asked to inform Transco about the actions of its subcontractor. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">The routing on the gate of the bridleway at the Robert 
 Franklin Way play area was still awaited. The Clerk was asked to inform the 
 Cotswold Water Park Society that this was still outstanding and to remind it of 
 previous requests for this work to be carried out.<p class="MsoNormal">Cllr 
 Harris asked the Clerk to inform the Cotswold Water Park Society that the 
 footpath sign at the end of Wildmoorway Lane with its junction with Robert 
 Franklin Way was broken at ground level. Another sign at Churn Pool in Cerney 
 Wick was also broken. The footpath sign at the entrance to Lake 10 was broken 
 and propped up but needed to be repaired. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report that the tarmac on 
 the footpath at Lower Mill was lifting up. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb complained that the path at the back of the 
 houses from Station Road to the wooden bridge at Boxbush was very rough. The 
 Clerk would report her observations to the GCC PROW officer. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had attended a meeting on highway matters at 
 CDC on 23rd January. One scenario worthy of note he reported, had been that 
 inspection of broken or damaged pavements obviated negligence. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to inform PCSO Yeomans that 
 vehicles were still parking on the restricted areas outside Ann Edwards school 
 causing inconvenience to other road users. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) informed the Parish Council that during 
 a recent clean up operation 57.2 tonnes of debris had been collected and 
 returned to Hills. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to inform GCC Highways that 
 the hedge on the cusp of Broadway Lane and Sudeley Drive was causing the tarmac 
 of the footpath there to lift up. 
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to inform Michael Grace, CDC 
 Enforcement Office about the signs which had been erected outside the Eliot 
 Arms, Clarks Hay. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) volunteered to make the necessary 
 enquiries. <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
