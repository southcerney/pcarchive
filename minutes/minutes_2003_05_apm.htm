    PARISH MEETING<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 21st MAY 2003</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Mr Stuart opened the meeting by stating that Mr Maurice 
    McKee had been taken ill that afternoon and was therefore unable to attend. 
    The Parish Council gratefully accepted Mrs Stuart’s offer to take the 
    minutes of the meeting.</p>
    <p align="left">Present: Parish Councillors Mrs Chapman, Mrs Chubb, Harris, 
    Jay, Mrs Pollard, Squires, Stuart, Webb, Cotswold District Councillors Mrs 
    Clark and Baines, Dr Jones (ex CDC), Sgt McIntyre (Gloucestershire 
    Constabulary), Mrs Gardiner (Parish Council Chairperson (Retd))</p>
    <p align="left">Apologies were received from the Mr Maurice McKee, Clerk to 
    the Parish Council, Parish Councillors J Caunce and Nicholas, Rev J Calvert, 
    Mr R Edgar (Chairman School Governors)</p>
    <p align="left"><b>MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING</b></p>
    <p align="left">It was proposed by Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Harris 
    that the minutes as published were a true record. The meeting was all in 
    favour.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Stuart pointed out that the award of £250 and a plaque 
    was awarded to South Cerney as a Regional winner in the Calor Gas/Daily 
    Telegraph sponsored national competition Village of the Year and was nothing 
    to do with the Bledisloe Cup. This was the first time that a Gloucestershire 
    village had won an award in this prestigious competition.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>PRESENTATION TO JENNY GARDINER</b></p>
    <p align="left">Before continuing the meeting the Cllr Stuart said a few 
    words in praise of Mrs Jenny Gardiner who retired from the Parish Council, 
    having served for 8 years and as Chairman for the past 4 years. He said 
    Jenny used a subtle mixture of charm, intelligent reasoning, humour and 
    firmness to keep the Parish Council running smoothly. He went on to list 
    some of her achievements, how she coped with the flooding crisis, the 
    controversial Camas site proposal and numerous attendance at many meetings 
    with all the various authorities. He concluded by saying it was a job well 
    done and thanked her very much. He then presented her with a bouquet of 
    flowers.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>PREVIOUS CHAIRPERSON’S REPORT</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Mrs Gardiner said she leaves the Parish Council with 
    mixed feelings. Her work load and family commitment mean that her time is 
    needed elsewhere. She continued that it had been a busy year for the Parish 
    Council. She said the Robert Franklin Way playing field and Upper Up park 
    plans are well under way and an expert has been called in to solve the 
    problems of the new ramp at the Upper Up playing field. She proudly laid the 
    wreath on behalf of the Parish Council and community on Remembrance Sunday. 
    She was also the Chairperson of the Finance Committee and was pleased to 
    report that the current financial position is good. The precept set for this 
    year is £43,150.00, a decrease of 8.3%. 80 planning applications were 
    considered of which 68 were granted and 7 refused. She added the cricket 
    club pavilion has been built and the football club plans a new clubhouse. 
    She thanked everyone who continued to keep the village clean and tidy, with 
    special thanks to Mr Wrightson. With regard to the flooding in the village, 
    a great deal of work took place and the CDC is still keeping a finger on the 
    issue. She then thanked Mr Maurice McKee for his invaluable help as Parish 
    Clerk, Cllr Stuart for stepping into her shoes at late notice on more than 
    one occasion, Cllrs Mrs Anne Clark, Dr Leslie Jones and Cllr Shaun Parsons 
    and all her councillors. She ended by saying she regretted that she failed 
    in one ambition, to close the meetings by 9.30 pm.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT BY SGT STEWART McINTYRE</b></p>
    <p align="left">Sgt McIntyre introduced himself saying he is stationed at 
    Tetbury with responsibilities in Cirencester, which polices South Cerney. He 
    said the Government has changed the criteria used for recording crimes, 
    which makes any comparative figures less easy to compare. He went on to say 
    the recorded crimes for South Cerney Parish have increased from 136 to 143, 
    detection rates have dropped from 30% to 18%. He did highlight however that 
    burglary is down from 35 to 26, auto-crime down from 24 to 18, however 
    violent crime is up from 14 to 25, mainly of a domestic nature, and criminal 
    damage up from 15 to 34. Putting these into perspective the recorded crimes 
    for this Inspector Neighbourhood Area rose from 1574 to 1688 with nearly all 
    crime headings increasing. Detection rates have risen slightly. He ended on 
    a good note stating that so far this year, since 1 April, there have only 
    been 14 reported offences in the Parish, 8 of which have been detected. He 
    concluded by saying he would be willing to attend some Council meetings 
    during the year, subject to his availability and will continue to supply a 
    monthly report to each local parish council.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="5%" valign="top">1.</td>
        <td width="95%">Dr Jones said crime rates in rural areas were 
        comparatively low per 1,000 population head per capita compared with 
        urban areas.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="5%" valign="top">2. </td>
        <td width="95%">The question was asked as to whether the criminals who 
        commit crimes of burglary and violence were young people. Sgt McIntyre 
        said the age range varied but the percentage was probably higher for 
        younger people. He added that the elderly continue to be vulnerable to 
        crime, and are often too trusting, despite the constant advice given not 
        to let anyone into your home.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="5%" valign="top">3.</td>
        <td width="95%">Cllr Stuart asked is the Mobile Police Station was well 
        received. Sgt McIntyre said this is working well, adding that here has 
        been a drop in anti social behaviour.</td>
      </tr>

        <td width="95%">Cllr Harris gave a brief report on the speed camera that 
        had been set up at the Robert Franklin end entrance to the village. What 
        was surprising was that there were in fact few persons who speed, 
        although the perception to the pedestrian was that cars were speeding. 
        Sgt McIntyre said this was true, but speeding does occur.</td>

        <td width="5%" valign="top">5.</td>
        <td width="95%">Cllr Harris asked if the newly arrived travellers were 
        causing any problems. Sgt McIntyre said the travellers had bought the 
        land legally and have applied for retrospective planning. They are not, 
        in fact, breaking any law by staying on the land having applied for 
        planning permission. He added that so far they are law abiding and no 
        complaints have been received by the police.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p align="left">Sgt McIntyre concluded his talk by saying he is contactable 
    any time by e-mail. He then left the meeting to return to duty.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT FROM CLLR MRS ANNE CLARK (CDC)</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Clark said she has served as Vice Chairman of the 
    Planning Committee for the past 18 months which now has 90% delegation, the 
    national target, and they are close to the top quarter of the authorities in 
    the Country for speed of determining applications. As a result a delivery 
    grant of £232,000 was received from the Government which is 3 times the 
    grant of any other authority in Gloucestershire. Last year nearly 3,000 
    applications were dealt with. She went on to say public speaking at meetings 
    was introduced at the beginning of the year which has proved helpful and has 
    worked well. The local plan first review has been out for consultation and 
    representations are currently being processed. There is no allocation for 
    further building land for South Cerney in the new local plan. She confirmed 
    that a planning application has been lodged for the recently arrived 
    caravans, which will come to committee in July. She was pleased to announce 
    that the Community Fund has been reinstated, although at a lower level of 
    £15,000. She said she was pleased to be re-elected and will now serve on the 
    Executive Committee and Planning Committee. This year she is joined by two 
    new councillors, Mr Mike Baines and Mr Clive Bennett. She concluded by 
    thanking the Parish Council for the enormous amount of work it puts in for 
    the village and its support to them as members.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>&nbsp;REPORT FROM EX CLLR DR LESLIE JONES</b></p>
    <p align="left">Dr Jones opened his report by stating that this year the 
    decision was made to make a number of cuts in its services, including the 
    closure of the Northleach Museum and closing some toilets in the county. 
    These cuts proved to be controversial but in the Council’s opinion 
    necessary. Another area which has caused a lot of discussion is the proposed 
    new traffic scheme. He went on to say that the refurbishment of the offices 
    of the CDC were completed this year and are an enormous improvement. Plans 
    for the new Leisure Centre are going ahead and it is hoped that this will be 
    completed during this financial year. Due to popular demand the decision was 
    taken to reinstate the Community Fund. A new initiative was introduced this 
    year, namely the Rural Cinema, whereby village halls within the county can 
    hire a film at a very realistic rate each month. This has proved to be very 
    popular. The council has fulfiled its obligations by building or acquiring 
    600 new houses for rent and plans to continue to provide 100 new homes 
    annually. As stated by Mrs Clark the local plan first review has been out 
    for consultation and is currently being processed. Dr Jones continued by 
    saying that the Council Tax for the CDC is up by 9% this year. Work is well 
    underway on the Thames and Severn Canal which will be an attractive amenity 
    for the area once completed. He concluded his report by saying he is 
    standing down after 12 years service. He thanked the South Cerney Parish 
    Council for their support over the years and wished them well for the 
    future.</p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Stuart then thanked Dr Leslie Jones for his support, 
    help and advice over the past 12 years, and wished him a happy retirement. 
    He also thanked Cllr Anne Clark and wished both herself and the two new 
    councillors well for the coming year.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT BY COUNCILLOR SHAUN PARSONS (GCC)</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Shaun Parsons reiterated Cllr Stuart’s comments on the 
    work carried out by Dr Leslie Jones, and he also wished him well in the 
    future. He reported that there has been an increase in Council Tax and 
    explained how the County spent the money. A large proportion of the money 
    goes on education, 60% of which is funded by the Government, the County 
    Council having to find the other 40%. Salaries for the police are set by the 
    Government which has increased by 27% since 1997. The County Council had to 
    provide 15% of the salaries in 1997, it is now 25%. He added that 
    Gloucestershire received one of the smallest increases in Bounty, namely 3%. 
    He said one of the main problems raised by the local communities was the 
    lack of a visible police presence, particularly in rural areas, and the 
    perceived increase in crime. There is also concern in the County regarding 
    care for the elderly with some 60,000 beds being lost since 1997, many of 
    whom could not afford to stay in business due to the new regulations. Some 
    of these regulations have been repealed and it is hoped that this will 
    encourage more care homes to open. With regard to the County roads he 
    explained that there are 4 qualities throughout the country, one being of 
    good quality to four being low quality. He said it will probably come as a 
    surprise to some that Gloucestershire roads come within the top quartile. 
    (This does not include trunk roads and motorways.) The urban areas appear to 
    fair better for repairs than the rural roads. He did add that deep pot 
    holes, which are dangerous, will be mended quickly once reported. He was 
    also pleased to add that, because people complained loudly, the new 
    concreted A419 by-pass will be tarmaced. Dr Leslie Jones confirmed that this 
    tarmacing was a high priority with the possibility of it being done in 
    2004/2005. Cllr Parsons concluded by saying he felt the proposal to adopt 
    Regional control was not in our best interests, with, as an example, 
    planning decisions being taken as far away as Exeter.</p>
    <p align="left">Q. Cllr Jay said the County Council were sadly lacking in 
    youth provision for South Cerney, stating that they provide for the youth at 
    the Water Park. At this point Cllr Jay thanked the Church for providing a 
    youth club, which is greatly appreciated by those who attend.</p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Parsons for his report, who then 
    departed.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT BY CLLR TONY SQUIRES ON BEHALF OF THE VICAR, REV J 
    CALVERT</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Squires said 2002 might well be designated the ‘Year of 
    the Toilet’. The Archdeacon of Cheltenham officially opened and Blessed the 
    toilets, which are haled as an outstanding example of a sympathetic addition 
    to a listed building. Refurbishment was also completed on the church organ 
    which involved a 90 degree turn round. Effort this year has been expended on 
    establishing a closer link with the United Church, with whom, it is hoped to 
    work ever more closely in the future. There are established church teams 
    working to service the community. Parish Neighbours has been re-launched and 
    have been briefed to be aware of any needs of families within the village. 
    The church is involved in work with children, with children workshops being 
    held on school premises and Friday evening youth club continues to cater 
    successfully for a wide range of teenagers. A new youth discussion group has 
    just been launched. The three churches try to serve the community as best 
    they can in addition to faithfully worshipping God.</p>
    <p align="left">REPORT ON ANN EDWARDS SCHOOL BY MR ROGER EDGAR, CHAIRMAN OF 
    SCHOOL GOVERNORS</p>
    <p align="left">Due to Mr McKee’s indisposition the report by Mr Roger 
    Edgar, Chairman of the School Governors, Ann Edwards School was not 
    available. It is attached in its entirety to these minutes.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT FROM MRS ANNE STUART, SECRETARY OF THE VILLAGE 
    HALL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</b></p>
    <p align="left">Mrs Stuart started her report by stating that 2002/2003 had 
    been a very rewarding year. Once the decision had been made not to allow 
    building on the Camas site the offer of a new community hall was no longer 
    valid, so the Village Hall Committee could go ahead with their plans for a 
    disabled toilet and other improvements. A request was made to the Parish 
    Council for approximately £12,000 to be added to this year’s precept, which 
    was approved. This was followed by the Chairman receiving a call from Rodney 
    Vaughan of the Gloucestershire Rural Community Council in mid February 
    asking if we could use £24,725.69 on offer from ACET (Adult Continuing 
    Education and Training), the catch being the work had to be completed by 1 
    April. The Chairman swiftly accepted their offer, set about drawing up 
    specifications, going out to tender, finding contractors, 5 in all, willing 
    to do the work in the short time frame, attending site meetings and then 
    overseeing the work from start to finish. With this money we were able to 
    build and furnish the new disabled toilet, refurbish the other toilets, 
    decorate the rear lobby and outside areas, install new, silent heaters and 
    install a new lighting system The only outstanding work is the double 
    glazing of the roof lights in the committee room and kitchen. We will also 
    shortly redecorate the main hall and committee room. In addition the stage 
    has been removed and the main hall floor refurbished. She went on to name 
    and thank all those contractors who were involved in the work. She also 
    thanked the Cerney Players for their help in removing the old stage and a 
    special thanks was expressed to Mavis Goscombe who had the unenviable task 
    of cleaning the hall on a daily basis while work was in progress.</p>
    <p align="left">A number of other initiatives took place over the year. 
    Sarah and David Smith had agreed to take on the running of the Rural Cinema 
    which is proving very successful and in October we had a successful 2 day 
    work party when we carried out a number of repairs. Bookings for the hall 
    have increased again by roughly 10% which is good news and especially 
    gratifying to those of us who are involved in the day to day running of the 
    hall. She concluded her report by saying she hoped the coming year would be 
    somewhat quieter for the committee</p>
    <p align="left">In addition to Mrs Stuart’s report Cllr Stuart thanked the 
    CDC for the introduction of the Rural Cinema, ably run by Claire Newport. He 
    also asked Cllr Clark to thank Mr Dan Goddard of Building Control and the 
    Conservation Officer in the CDC for their excellent service in pushing 
    through all the necessary permissions prior to the work starting on the 
    Village Hall.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT FROM 29 REGIMENT RLC</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Stuart said this year he was pleased to say that 
    representatives from 29 Regiment RLC had agreed to attend the meeting to 
    give a short report on their activities. He then introduced Major Ian Bruce, 
    the Technical Quartermaster and Sgt Steve Jelf, the Chief Instructor of the 
    Silver Stars. Maj Bruce said the Regiment has had a very busy year, 
    especially the last 4 months. 20,000 troops and 1 million tons of air 
    freight have been processed through the Joint Air Mounting Centre in the 
    last 4 months, with over 80,000 troops deploying over the past 12 months. 
    The two trades at the Regiment, namely Movement Controller and Postal and 
    Courier Operatives have been under immense pressure and have had to be back 
    filled by TA personnel. The Movement Control Squadrons are currently 
    carrying out back to back operations and the Postal and Courier Operatives 
    are working up to 18 hour days in theatre. Currently the Colonel and 
    headquarters staff are in Iraq organising the return of troops from Op 
    TELIC. Troops are also still deploying through South Cerney to ‘fight the 
    peace’. He said every effort is made to support families while their spouses 
    are deployed and the Regiment runs a successful Play school and Youth Club. 
    Cllr Stuart thanked Maj Bruce and Sgt Jelf for attending and giving a 
    report.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>PRESENTATION BY THE MARQUIS DE DERVAL ET DE MOISDON 
    REGARDING COMPLAINTS BY RESIDENTS ON AIRCRAFT NOISE FROM SOUTH CERNEY 
    STATION</b></p>
    <p align="left">Before inviting the Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon to speak 
    Cllr Stuart asked what his objectives were. Were they to stop the 
    parachutists altogether? The Marquis said that was not his intention, he 
    liked the parachutists, what he wanted was to stop the noisy aircraft. The 
    Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon then took up Cllr Stuart’s invitation to 
    give a 10 minute presentation to the Parish Meeting on aircraft noise 
    emanating from South Cerney Station. Prior to the start of the meeting the 
    Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon had circulated copies of his presentation. 
    The Marquis went through the presentation in detail. He gave details of all 
    the historical facts that have taken place over the years, culminating this 
    year in an in-depth study by the Secretary of State for Defence into the 
    flying activities in South Cerney Station, which concluded that flying could 
    continue with restricted flying times and flying taking place on 3 weekends 
    in 4. The Marquis stated that to date there have been frequent breaches of 
    the flying restrictions imposed on the Silver Stars and the pilots of 
    Williams Air Services. He also stated that the 1999 Village Appraisal showed 
    that some 307 people objected to parachute jumping and aircraft noise. He 
    added that complaints concerning the activities of the Silver Stars and the 
    aircraft used by them have been in existence since their commencement of 
    parachute jumping in 1991/1992. Prior to this Lord Fanshawe spent some 10 
    years complaining about gliders and later on parachutists being towed into 
    the air. This complaint was also investigated by the then Secretary of 
    State, Lord Soames. The Marquis said he has contacted a number of people 
    regarding aircraft noise including Mr Clifton Brown MP, Mr Brassington, 
    Environmental Officer of the CDC and the Commanding Officer of 29 Regiment, 
    who have adopted varying attitudes towards complaints. Despite complaints 
    the noise pollution continues. He continued by saying that the operational 
    aircraft used by the Silver Stars are not military aircraft but owned by a 
    registered limited company. He also said that the Under Secretary of State 
    admitted in a letter that the parachute team is not a military one but is 
    there to fulfil an important need in supplying our Service personnel with a 
    recognised Army sport and adventurous training activity, which the Marquis 
    compared to being a hobby and not required by the military role of any 
    Logistic Corps. His presentation concluded by stating the complainants’ 
    objectives. One, that there is a strict form of self regulation of flying 
    times, two to permanently restrict parachute jumping to a single aircraft 
    and not two as it appears, three for public consultation to take place 
    between the complainants and the Commanding Officer 29 Regiment and four 
    that the Parish Council support the complainants and residents they now 
    represent in the proposed actions indicated above.</p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Stuart then asked Maj Bruce and Sgt Jelf to reply to 
    some of the points raised by the Marquis. Maj Bruce said he is the Major in 
    charge of the Silver Stars and he will ensure that restricted flying times 
    are adhered to at all times. However the main point he wished to raise was 
    the fact that there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the Silver 
    Stars and their flying activities. They rarely use the airfield during the 
    week, most of their flying takes place over the weekend. The aircraft that 
    use the airfield during the week, (a Sky Van and Cessna), are owned by the 
    RAF who use the airfield for military parachute training purposes. 29 
    Regiment has no control over their use of the airfield nor of their flying 
    times. With regard to the Silver Stars aircraft Sgt Jelf said Williams Air 
    Services were negotiating to purchase an aircraft with a quieter engine. 
    When Cllr Squires confirmed that an aircraft had taken off the previous 
    Thursday and had circled over the village, which was one of the objections 
    from the complainants, Sgt Jelf confirmed that this was the RAF Sky Van and 
    had nothing to do with the Silver Stars. Cllr Harris asked if the aircraft 
    needed to make so much noise on landing. Sgt Jelf said as he was not a pilot 
    he was unable to answer that question.</p>
    <p align="left">A number of further comments were made from the floor. Mrs 
    Gardiner said she had lived in the village most of her life and had no 
    objection to the noise. In fact she felt if you live near an active airfield 
    you must expect aircraft noise. Cllr Chapman said she had lived in the area 
    all her life adding that the noise was less now than it used to be. Mrs 
    Thornton said it may be that the issue of the perceived noisy aircraft could 
    be overcome if Williams Air Services are successful in their negotiations to 
    purchase a quieter aircraft. Cllr Stuart thanked everyone for their comments 
    on this matter saying he hoped progress had been made, especially with 
    regard to the fact that it appears the Silver Stars have been unfairly 
    blamed for all aircraft noise when the majority of the noise during the week 
    is caused by the RAF. Cllr Jay said he would like the admiration, respect 
    and gratitude of the Parish Council and all those present to be passed to 
    the members of 29 Regiment RLC for the dedication and service they provide 
    to the British Army and country.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>ANY OTHER BUSINESS</b></p>
    <p align="left">Cllr Harris gave a brief report on the progress of the work 
    to build a small park with mountain biking facility on the Upper Up playing 
    field, now aptly named the Upper Ups and Downs. This has been 4 years in the 
    planning and should shortly be completed.</p>
    <p align="left">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
    meeting at 9.55 pm.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>REPORT ON ANN EDWARDS SCHOOL BY ROGER EDGAR, CHAIRMAN OF 
    SCHOOL GOVERNORS</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>Personnel</b></p>
    <p align="left">As you will probably know Mrs. Arnold is leaving us after 5 
    years as our Head Teacher. She has been appointed as one of Her Majesty’s 
    Inspectors for schools. We will be very sorry to see her go as she had a 
    very great impact on the progress the school has made. The Governors have 
    appointed Mr. Stephen Richardson as Mrs. Arnold’s replacement to start in 
    September. This appointment followed an intensive selection process starting 
    with 13 applications which were whittled down to 4 very strong candidates 
    who then undertook tasks which they had to present their solutions to the 
    selection panel and on the following day they had an hour long interview. 
    The selection panel consisted of 5 governors with a LEA registered inspector 
    and the Diocesan Director of Education acting as advisors and observers.</p>
    <p align="left">On the teaching staff Mrs Sedgwick has been appointed for 
    the duration of Mrs. White’s maternity leave. We have also appointed Mrs. 
    Godfrey to support the learning of children in Y2, working alongside Mrs. 
    Nelmes and Mrs. Harris to support the learning of children in the reception 
    year, working with Mrs. Wallis to assist her particularly with a pupil who 
    is on the school action plus stage of the SEN register. All support staff 
    will have their posts re-graded shortly following a huge job evaluation 
    project recently undertaken across the county. The Governors were sorry to 
    lose Col. Mike Hickson on his being promoted and posted. However, we are 
    pleased that the new Commanding Officer Lt.Col. Sean English has taken his 
    place on the Governing Body. Currently we have 256 pupils on roll, which is 
    about the same as this time last year. Our pupil mobility of around 25% is 
    about the same as last year with 4 months of the school year left. So far it 
    looks as if there will be 42 new entrants in Reception in September.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Governors Activities</b></p>
    <p align="left">Governors’ meetings and committees have been well attended 
    and there have been some lively discussions. Governors have attended In 
    Service Training days as well as being involved with the staff in policy 
    review working groups. Governors have paid regular planned visits to the 
    school and have also attended the annual review with the assigned inspector. 
    A number of training courses both during the day and in the evening have 
    been attended so that the Governors can keep up to date with current 
    legislation and practice.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Curriculum and SATS</b></p>
    <p align="left">Our ICT suite with 16 computers continues to be fully 
    utilised and classes have had timetabled sessions each week. This has proved 
    to be a very good investment and has contributed to pupils improving 
    standards. Our results in the Key Stage 2 SATS tests were down on the 
    previous year but in some areas exceeded our expectations. The short OFSTED 
    inspection at the beginning of the autumn term showed that &quot;this is a good 
    school that is held in high regard by the parents. The headteacher provides 
    a strong commitment to improvement that is well supported by the governors, 
    teachers and parents. The school offers a good quality of education for its 
    pupils. It successfully promotes positive attitudes to learning and good 
    behaviour resulting in overall improvements to the standards achieved over 
    time. The school gives good value for money.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Other Extra Curriculum School Activities</b></p>
    <p align="left">There has been an ICT for Parents organised through 
    Cirencester College Outreach department and Family Learning activities run 
    at the school. Other after school activities include an after school 
    computer club, chess, pottery, hockey, gym, netball, football, dance, 
    gardening and the ‘Bug Club’ for those interested in nature and the 
    environment. Thanks must go to the staff for giving their time and energy in 
    organising these activities.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Footsteps - Educating towards a more sustainable future</b></p>
    <p align="left">We have continued our link with the Joel Omino School in 
    Kisumo and the children regularly contact through pen letters. We have sent 
    further educational materials with the assistance of the 29th Regt RLC.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>D.A.R.E. Project</b></p>
    <p align="left">P.C. John Smith of the MOD police 29th Regt RLC has again 
    been running the drug awareness programme for Year 6 pupils called DARE, 
    Drug Abuse Resistance Education. He has the confidence of all the children 
    taking the course and has organised the presentation ceremony for the 
    beginning of June.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>Other Activities</b></p>
    <p align="left">Y4 children have been on a highly successful residential 
    visit to the Wilderness Centre. The school have had visits from The Life 
    Education Bus, also from the various Theatre Groups, the Road Safety Unit 
    and Nick Williams the ‘Bird Wise’ man. Pupils have taken part in the 
    inter-schools dance festival, the inter-schools swimming gala, and netball, 
    football tournaments.</td>
