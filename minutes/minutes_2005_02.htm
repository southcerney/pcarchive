    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    in favour. Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Portfolios</b><br>
    Cllr Jay observed that under the new Portfolio arrangement an instance had 
    arisen where a subject which was in the jurisdiction of a Committee was also 
    in a Portfolio of a Parish Councillor who was not a member of that 
    Committee. It was agreed that in the event of a repeat situation then the 
    Portfolio holder would attend a meeting of the relevant Committee.<br>
    <b>Water Park meeting</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Council that due to other commitments he would be 
    unable to attend an Executive Committee meeting of the Water Park on the 11 
    February.<br>
    <b>Meeting with J. Whittaker (GCC Highways)</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on a meeting held with Mr Whittaker on 9 February to 
    determine the most appropriate place for the siting of the zebra crossing, 
    the positioning of the interactive speed signs, the repositioning of the 
    30mph signs 150 metres north of their current position in Silver Street, 
    readjustment of the speed limits from Silver Street to Preston Toll Bar and 
    the use of the old railway line as a bicycle track to Siddington.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Thursday 20 January Cllr M. Stuart and I had a meeting with Alex Fraser 
    from Afla Ltd to discuss revised plans for the public art scheme to be used 
    at Jubilee Gardens. Mr Fraser will provide a plan for Parish Councillors to 
    appraise and implementation will be in two stages. Firstly the ground work 
    and general planting to be followed in the autumn with the tree planting. 
    Provisionally it was agreed that the Parish Council would add the area to 
    its ground maintenance schedule. On Thursday 3 February I attended a 
    briefing and reception by the Army Presentation Team in the Corn Hall, 
    Cirencester. Also present representing the Parish Council were Cllr Stuart, 
    Cllr Squire and Cllr Jay. The presentation detailed the make-up and 
    activities of the modern Army and how its role had changed to cope with the 
    demise of the cold war and the threat of global terrorism in the 21st 
    century. On Friday 4 February I met with Cllr S. Parsons (GCC), Cllr M. 
    Stuart, Martyn Summerell and John Whittaker GCC County Highways in 
    Cirencester to discuss outstanding matters, details of which appear in 
    Matters Arising of the Minutes of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
    Committee. This afternoon I met with John Whittaker, Cllr Stuart and Cllr 
    Squire to decide on where the zebra would be best sited, the cycle track 
    along the old railway line from Northmoor Lane to the Greyhound public house 
    in Siddington, the position of the interactive signs and the resiting of the 
    30mph signs in Silver Street. During January I averaged 3 hours 30 minutes 
    over the 20 available working days which meets the contract terms precisely.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Committee which had met on 
    Monday 7th February.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising<br>
    Highway Matters:<br>
    Zebra Crossing</b><br>
    The Clerk reported on a meeting with John Whittaker (GCC Highways Area 
    Traffic Manager (Cotswolds)), Martyn Summerell (GCC Highways Assistant 
    Divisional Surveyor), Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) and Cllr M. Stuart on Friday 4th 
    February in Cirencester. The zebra crossing which had been postponed and its 
    financing transferred to the impact scheme to extend the resurfacing of 
    Station Road, would be looked at once again. It was hoped that its priority 
    would be maintained, as the scheme had already been close to construction, 
    but because of disagreement the finance for it had been used elsewhere in 
    the village. The highways officers were informed that the Parish Council had 
    now voted in favour of its installation. Mr Whittaker envisaged that it 
    would take three months for the legal side, one month to design and two 
    months to construct the crossing and the scheme would be in competition for 
    available funds. Cllr Parsons said that as its construction had nearly been 
    started in the recent past the scheme should not be relegated. Mr Whittaker 
    agreed.<br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs</b><br>
    Mr Whittaker informed the meeting that interactive signs which used solar 
    and wind for power cost approximately £4,000 to supply and install. He 
    recommended that they be placed some 150 metres inside the 30mph zone.<br>
    <b>Speed Limits on Cirencester Road</b><br>
    Mr Whittaker agreed to consider the reduction of the speed limits from 
    Preston Toll Bar to the army camp from the national limit to 50mph and to 
    reduce the existing 50mph outside the camp married quarters to 40mph until 
    the Talland riding school. He would liaise with the police to reduce the 
    national limit from beyond the Talland riding school to 50mph but was not 
    sure if the limit could be enforced. He further agreed to move the existing 
    30mph sign from its current position to 150 metres before the entrance of 
    Northmoor Lane and install another 30mph on that lane to inform oncoming 
    vehicles that they were about to enter a 30mph limit.<br>
    <b>Footpath Widening</b><br>
    Mr Summerell would increase the width of the footpath on the east side of 
    Silver Street in the vicinity of Berry’s Farm. Cllr Stuart had spoken to Mrs 
    G. Portlock (GCC Highways) who would inspect and possibly widen the section 
    of footpath from the Meadow Way to Village Hall path and then only the 
    narrow section running from the eastern end of the Riverside path down to 
    Berkeley Horns.<br>
    <br>
    <b>South Cerney to Siddington Cycle Route</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart suggested that as the canal cycle route was proving difficult to 
    implement why not use the old railway track instead. This idea was received 
    favourably and Mr Whittaker was encouraged by Cllr Parsons to approach the 
    landowners for their agreement.<br>
    <b>Road Sweeping</b><br>
    Mr Summerell was adamant that it was the responsibility of CDC to keep roads 
    swept clean in the Parish. This arrangement had been in force for more than 
    four years although to his knowledge roads were swept infrequently if at all 
    during the past two years. Mr Summerell suspected that the budget could not 
    cope and other factors had reduced the number of contractors willing to 
    quote for the work. Cllr Stuart gave a detailed report on the history of the 
    road cleaning fiasco.<br>
    <b>Outstanding Work at Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that all of the outstanding maintenance matters 
    reported to the Cotswold Water Park Society had been resolved.<br>
    <b>Street Lighting</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had been in contact with Mr Greenaway who agreed to inspect the 
    illumination of the new bridge over the Churn at Bow Wow and Box Bush and 
    report back on how it might be improved. The Clerk was asked to inform him 
    that a light on the path from Box Bush to Station Road was obscured by trees 
    owned by Mr R. Webb.<br>
    <b>Street Signs</b><br>
    Street signs had not yet been replaced. The Clerk informed the Committee 
    that the CDC had been informed and the Cotswold Water Park would be told 
    about the missing Station Road sign at the junction of Station Road, Cerney 
    Wick Lane and the B4696.<br>
    <b>Dog Warden</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that Julie Townsend CDC Dog Warden had promised to 
    install dog litter bins at Upper Up car park and Riverside Walk near to 
    Riverway although this would not be until the new budget came into force in 
    April 2005.<br>
    <b>Refurbishment of Upper Up car park</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that his contact had declined an opportunity to 
    refurbish the car park. The Clerk was asked to revise the specification for 
    the work, that the surface is broken up with a digger bucket, levelled and 
    compacted. The Committee agreed with Cllr Harris’ assessment that it was not 
    necessary to add new gravel.<br>
    <b>Public Rights of Way</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb had attended a meeting of local bodies at the 
    Millennium Centre, Keynes Park to discuss local PROWs. The Clerk was asked 
    to invite a representative from Siddington Parish Council to a meeting to 
    discuss the South Cerney to Siddington cycle route and other mutually shared 
    footpaths and bridleways.<br>
    <b>War Memorial</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that he was very pleased with the amount of donations 
    received so far for the refurbishment of the vandalised War Memorial. He 
    expected to go to tender next week. When the work is completed a Service of 
    Dedication would be held and those who had made donations would be invited. 
    29th Regiment at Duke of Gloucester Barracks had agreed to send a contingent 
    of soldiers to the event. The Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart gave his heartfelt 
    thanks to Cllr Squire for his effort and Parish Councillors applauded.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that all equipment was in working order. Motorcyclists 
    had been asked to leave the cycle mounds and if this behaviour persists then 
    a sign banning them should be erected.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in working order. The lamination 
    of one panel on the adventure unit in the toddlers play area was peeling and 
    should be removed. The Clerk was asked to contact Macventure Play Co to 
    quote for a replacement board. The entrance at Robert Franklin Way was 
    becoming muddy and needed some gravel. Cllr Squire had suggested at a 
    previous meeting that over matter from the path to Bow Wow via the Church 
    could be used. The pyracantha on far side of the fence on Lakeside boundary 
    needs to be cleared. The chain link fence had been erected.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order.<br>
    <br>
    <b>ANNUAL SAFETY INSPECTIONS</b><br>
    Parish Councillors considered the report as satisfactory as the inspector 
    had found only low risk items to criticise.<br>
    <br>
    <b>BRIDGE SURVEY</b><br>
    A report detailing the damage to the single span brick arch bridge which 
    carries the disused railway over the river Churn at grid reference 405562 
    197359 had been received and two repair options were presented. The Parish 
    Council agreed with the recommendation from Cllr Harris that the first 
    option, excepting the installation of timber fences, is preferred.<br>
    <br>
    <b>TREE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Harris presented the tree report and thanked Cllr Webb for his 
    participation. The Parish Council agreed with his recommendation that his 
    analysis be used as the basis for a specification of the work needed and 
    sent out to tender. The Parish Council agreed with the recommendation of the 
    Committee that the area in the vicinity of South Cerney Farmhouse to the 
    notice board in Clarks Hay, where the cherry trees are currently growing, be 
    planted with hornbeam. The Clerk was asked to inform GCC Highways of ivy 
    growth which should be removed on the parapet of the bridge nearest to the 
    Old George public house. GCC Highways was to be informed that tree surgery 
    was urgently needed on five weeping willows on the other side of the river 
    Churn from the Old Vicarage. Likewise, it should be pointed out to Lady 
    Fanshawe that the cuppressus hedge between Lower Mill and Lower Churn needs 
    cutting back hard to stop traffic being pushed onto the opposite verge. As 
    had already been mentioned in the Safety Inspection report the pyracantha 
    hedge at Robert Franklin Way playing field should be removed and the ash 
    trees thinned to leave only four of the better specimens. The Parish Council 
    agreed with the recommendation of the Committee that a separate contract is 
    awarded for this work. Cllr Harris asked that Parish Councillors should 
    re-visit the area of South Cerney Farmhouse to the south of Meadow Way to 
    determine if this area should be assessed as a separate tender item. Cllr 
    Harris informed Cllr Jay that scrub clearance to the north of the Piece 
    would be added as an addendum to the schedule.<br>
    Cllr Stuart suggested that the Parish Council consider planting the area to 
    the north of the lake at Upper Up playing field but agreed with Cllr Jay who 
    argued that the area should be left to mature to see how it develops before 
    any action is taken. The Parish Council agreed to a recommendation from Cllr 
    Harris that the planting of the wet land area be discussed as an agenda item 
    in September.<br>
    <br>
    <b>GROUND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb declared a prejudicial interest as the wife of one of the 
    bidding contractors and left the room.<br>
    After a long discussion on the performance and price of the various 
    contractors, it was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
    the main contract, including the churchyard, is awarded to Adrian Gibbs for 
    the next two years. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb rejoined the debate.<br>
    It was further proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Smith that the 
    contract for the next two years for ground maintenance in Cerney Wick is 
    awarded to Rodney Gardiner. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb asked that the Committee consider erecting a bus shelter in 
    the vicinity of the entrance to the Lennards. The Clerk was asked to source 
    a supplier and the price of a “stand alone” bus shelter.<br>
    Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to write to the occupants of 8 Broadway Lane and 
    ask them to cut back their hedge which was overgrowing the pavement.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to write to Mr &amp; Mrs Paxton at Cerney Wick 
    and ask them to cut back their hedge which was overgrowing the carriageway.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard presented a photograph of cars parked on the pavement and 
    public grass area at Thrift Cottage and asked the Clerk to write to them 
    requesting that they stop this unsocial behaviour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>

    Monday 7th February.<br>

    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman, due to the absence of Cllr Nicholas, reported on the 
    deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on Monday 7th

    Retrospective application for a Change of Use of the garage forecourt to 
    allow for the sale of used cars at Central Garage, Clarks Hay, South Cerney<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.5790/M</b><br>
    Proposed dormer extension at 2 Hambledon Close, South Cerney<br>
    The application site is a relatively modern property which exhibits a 
    neo-Georgian character in appearance, form and design detailing. The roof 
    form of the building is an intrinsic and important element of its character 
    and the proposal seeks to interrupt this roof form with a substantial 
    hip-roofed dormer window. Due to its scale, bulk, form and design, the 
    proposal would have a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of 
    the property and is consequently contrary to guidance contained in PPG1 and 
    PPS7 and Cotswold Local Plan Policies 2 and 40.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE PLAN</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard had analysed the information from the wall charts onto a 
    spread sheet. A meeting had been arranged with Mel Tarrant (GRCC) for 2.30pm 
    on Wednesday 16th February and the Clerk was asked to invite Dr Stephenson, 
    Steven Walker and Patrick Mills to attend.<br>

        Cllr Stuart suggested that the Clerk writes to Alistair Strong Head of

    <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported that it was the objective of the South Cerney Trust to 
    disperse its excess funds. Consideration was being given, among other 
    matters, to publishing the Cerney Directory yearly instead of its current 
    cycle of every two years.<br>
    Cllr Jay congratulated Chairman Cllr M. Stuart on his auctioneering skills 
    at a fund raising event on behalf of the Tsunami Boat Appeal. The total 
    amount now raised is in excess of £14,000.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported that the Village Hall sign at the junction of School Lane 
    and Silver Street was missing.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported that there was graffiti in the bus shelter and encouraged 
    members of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee to arrange 
    for the interior to be repainted.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported on a meeting he had with members of the South Cerney 
    Football Club and was pleased to meet two of his ex-pupils who were now 
    qualified Football Association coaches. He was very impressed with their 
    activities. A request had been made by the Football Club that consideration 
    be given to the possibility of installing an all weather training pitch. The 
    Parish Council was in favour and asked Cllr Jay to investigate what it might 
    cost.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the collapsed carriageway just inside the 
    30mph limit in Cerney Wick had still not been repaired.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 9.55pm.</td>
