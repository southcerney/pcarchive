 Cllr Smith who was absent from the meeting the remainder of the Parish Council 
 was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas, on behalf of the Youth Parish Council, 
 explained that due to the holiday period there was not a representative 
 available to attend the meeting. He had been asked to report that the YPC were 
 continuing with its arrangements for the Sports Day due to be held in 
 September. Parish Councillors were asked if any one was prepared to carry out a 
 Health &amp; Safety Risk Assessment of the Upper Up playing field in advance of the 
 YPC Sports Day in September. The Clerk was asked to inform Claire Dowan (CDC) 
 that there was no volunteer forthcoming.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Trinity Trust</b><br>
 Cllr Stuart, Mrs A. Stuart and Cllr Jay as representatives of the Management 
 Committee of South Cerney Village Hall would attend a meeting of the Trinity 
 Trust in Cerney Wick to give them the benefit of their experience in relation 
 to the creation of their project. Cllr Squire would also attend.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 7th August.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Honey Combed Safety Surface</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that he had completed the reinstatement of the 
 honey-combed safety surface.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Highway Matters</b> <br>
 Rob Vale, Asset Manager at Gloucestershire Highways had written to update the 
 Parish Council on the three outstanding issues. The pedestrian crossing has 
 been through the initial design. Some initial consultation will be taken back 
 to objecting residents to try and resolve their concerns. It is aimed to 
 install the speed activated signs within the next two months depending on the 
 cooperation of the supplier of the electrical connections. The alteration to 
 the speed restrictions on the South Cerney to Preston Toll Bar road will be 
 completed by the beginning of September.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 The Pay Back in the Community group is awaiting the provision of a skip. Cllr 
 Harris volunteered to approach a suitable supplier.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Tennis Club</b><br>
 Cllr Harris confirmed that the flagstones had been repaired and/or replaced 
 where necessary. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lady Fanshawe’s Hedge<br>
 </b>Cllr Squire will liaise with Gillian Portlock (Gloucestershire Highways) on 
 a plan to reduce the growth of the hedge in Bow Wow. It was agreed that a 
 tactful approach was needed as Lady Fanshawe had experienced trespassers using 
 her private facilities recently and further distress regarding her offending 
 hedge should be minimal. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Huxley Court</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the street sign “Huxley Court” was unreadable. The 
 Clerk had reported its condition to R. Bull (CDC) who replied that he had made 
 arrangements for its refurbishment.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported the play area was in good order with the new picnic table, 
 which had been purchased and installed by the South Cerney Trust, getting 
 plenty of use.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b> <br>
 The 360 degree swing was causing concern. Suspicious sounds were emanating from 
 the base of the main beam when the equipment was used vigorously and Cllr 
 Harris requested that other members of the Committee inspect the apparatus and 
 make their own assessment. Cllr Harris reported that the tower slide was 
 looking “tired”. The goal post area was wearing out in the middle. Tree 
 branches are drooping down low over the bridlepath and will need attention 
 soon.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that Adrian Gibbs had strimmed the mounds. Accompanied by 
 Cllr Harris they had sprayed four tonnes of water on the trees at Jubilee 
 Gardens and Upper Up. One oak, near Walnut Tree House, is looking very poorly. 
 The rubber coating on the vertical rods of the cradle of the Junior Swing were 
 perishing. The Clerk was asked to obtain estimates for their replacement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on a discussion he had with Thames 
 Water surveyors who were researching a suitable route for the replacement 
 sewage pipe to Shorncote. He hoped that the preferred route would be along the 
 southern perimeter of the playing fields cutting across to the Ashton Keynes to 
 Cirencester road. If Thames Water is to use the playing fields it was agreed 
 that the Parish Council consider the appointment of a Chartered Surveyor to 
 maximise compensation and ensure that reinstatement of the area is carried out 
 satisfactorily. Cllr Stuart had spoken with Chris Graham (Moore Allen &amp; 
 Innocent) who would be prepared to act on behalf of the Parish Council and 
 other local land owners. Thames Water would be expected to pay all professional 
 fees but this should be confirmed prior to any agreement to use Mr Graham. The 
 Parish Council agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed with Cllr Harris who suggested that 
 Andrew Timbrell (A. P. Transport) be asked to provide a quotation to dredge the 
 ditch in Station Road. It was agreed that Mr Timbrell be asked to remove the 
 deposited soil from the ditch on the southern boundary of Upper Up at right 
 angles to the cricket pavilion. The Clerk had found a letter from 
 Gloucestershire County Highways dated October 2001 which confirmed its 
 willingness to contribute £300 towards the cost of drain clearing. The Clerk 
 was to remind Gloucestershire Highways of this fact and ask them if they would 
 be prepared to repeat it. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb informed the Committee that her husband had 
 cut back their hedge along the footpath from Station Road to Bow Wow. However, 
 she complained about the amount of weed growth that needed to be cleared. The 
 Clerk had requested Adrian Gibbs to strim the path. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the overgrowth on the public 
 footpath from Church Lane to the Downings had been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the public seat opposite Londis 
 in Broadway Lane had been vandalised. R.O.W. Berry had quoted £95 to replace 
 the four one inch oak slats. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by 
 Cllr Smith that the Parish Council accepts the verbal quote from Mr Berry. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire informed the Committee that he had taken on 
 responsibility to provide an environmental plan for the church within the 
 community in conjunction with the Parish Council and CDC. One scheme to be 
 developed was the provision of a new tank to collect water from the church roof 
 which would allow the metered supply at the church entrance to be disconnected. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported that over 100 children had attended 
 the CDC organised sports day at Upper Up play area. The Clerk was asked to 
 write to Scott Berry CDC Youth Sport Development officer to congratulate his 
 team on its efforts. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on yet another sewerage leak at 
 Robert Franklin Way. Although the repair had been made very quickly the clean 
 up of the resultant discharge in Kingfisher Place was uncoordinated. With the 
 help of Cllr Bennett (CDC) those responsible had been coerced to clear up the 
 resultant pollution. He reminded the Committee that the meeting with Thames 
 Water to discuss its progress with the refurbishment plan which originally had 
 been planned for the Friday 29 September had been postponed and would now take 
 place on Friday 6 October at 2pm in the Village Hall. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP 
 would chair the meeting and all Parish Councillors were encouraged to attend.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Flow Meter in School Lane</b> <br>
 The Committee was opposed to an application to install a flow meter between 
 Cordal Lodge and Andrews in School Lane because the position suggested would 
 not monitor all of the river at that point as the Mill Stream used part of the 
 flow. The Committee suggested that the meter is set between Draycott, School 
 Lane and Fanshawe weir where a more accurate flow of all the river could be 
 achieved. Cllr Jay objected to this suggestion and after some discussion it was 
 agreed that the Clerk write to the Environment Agency to ask why the meter is 
 needed and to suggest that the installation is sited in a more unobtrusive 
 location. He was also asked to invite a representative of the Environment 
 Agency to attend a discussion with Parish Councillors to decide where it could 
 be best installed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reinstatement of river bank in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Martyn Summerell, Area Highways Manager East had replied negatively to a 
 request from the Parish Council that Gloucestershire Highways consider making a 
 payment to James Harris for the work schedule he produced for the reinstatement 
 of the river bank. Mr Summerell suggested that should the Parish Council wish 
 to take the project forward he would make a financial contribution to the 
 works. The Clerk was asked to emphasise that this was deflecting his 
 responsibility for the maintenance of the bank. As the Parish Council was 
 concerned about the way in which the work would be carried out, it would be 
 prepared to make a contribution towards the cost of design and supervision to 
 achieve an aesthetically acceptable outcome. Cllr Jay was sympathetic to a 
 suggestion that the Parish Council invite the South Cerney Trust to make a 
 contribution towards the cost of the work. The Parish Council was mindful that 
 the matter should be resolved in the near term.</p>

 Committee which had met on 7th August.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Annual Accounts</b> <br>
 The Clerk informed the Committee that the Auditor’s queries had been 
 satisfactorily answered.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Parish Council<br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reported that Youth Parish Councillors Thomas Nicholas and Joe 
 Lodge had accompanied their senior colleagues Parish Councillors Nicholas, 
 Stuart and Squire to the Calor Gas Village of the Year awards. T. Nicholas and 
 J. Lodge collected the £500 first prize for the Youth People category. South 
 Cerney also won first prize of £500 for the IT category and was runner up in 
 the Building Community Life category.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reinstatement of river Churn bank in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 The Committee agreed that the response from Gloucestershire Highways was 
 confused, as it was its responsibility to ensure that the reinstatement was 
 satisfactorily carried out. Notwithstanding, it was in the interests of the 
 Parish Council that the work is carried out sympathetically, bearing in mind 
 that the area was considered a very attractive part of the village. The 
 Committee was minded to make a contribution to Gloucestershire Highways in 
 order that it might complete the reinstatement of the river bank in one tranche. 
 If the Parish Council agreed the Clerk was to ask South Cerney Trust if it 
 would make a contribution to the restoration. The Parish Council was in favour 
 of the above recommendations.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>

 Through an administration error by the CDC, this application had been sent to 
 the wrong address. Nevertheless the Committee instructed the Clerk to make the 
 following response, and to point out to the Planning Officer the reason for the 
 delay. The site is not suitable for permanent, unrestricted accommodation or as 
 a primary place of residence because of its open countryside location. The 
 dwelling to be erected as part of the development should not be occupied from 
 the 6th January until the 5th February (inclusive) in each year, to control the

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2443/P</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb reported on correspondence he was having with Michael Grace (CDC 
 Planning Enforcement Officer) regarding alleged breaches of planning conditions 
 imposed on Bloor Homes developers of Winchcombe Gardens in Berkeley Close. It 
 was determined that Mr Grace was aware of one breach concerning the blocking 
 off of the carriageway and asked which other conditions were being ignored. 
 Cllr Webb stated that in his opinion the following conditions were also being 
 breached: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 24. Furthermore no planning permission had 
 been granted for the five additional plots Nos 24 to 28. Mr Grace intimated 
 that no further action would be taken regarding the violations. The Committee 
 recommends that the Clerk write to Mr Grace and ask him to explain CDC policy 
 on its failure to enforce the conditions asking Mr Grace for a fully reasoned 
 response before the next Parish Council meeting on 13 September. If agreed, the 
 Clerk should copy the letter to Cllr Baines (CDC) Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr 
 Mrs Clark (CDC). The Parish Council was in agreement and accepts the 
 recommendation of the Planning Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Waste Disposal Consultation</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb argued that the Parish Council should make reasoned objections where 
 appropriate to proposals in a consultation document currently on circulation. 
 The document from Wiltshire County Council and Swindon Borough Council suggests 
 that suitable recycling sites should be considered on the western side of 
 Wiltshire adjacent to South Cerney when gravel extraction there is exhausted. 
 He enquired what, if any, response had been made to previous proposals. The 
 Clerk could not recall any such response being made. The Parish Council 
 supported the opinion of Cllr Webb who volunteered to make a suitable response 
 and would liaise with the Clerk. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Traffic issues on Spine Road</b> <br>
 The Parish Council was in agreement with Cllr Nicholas who said that with the 
 proliferation of permitted planning development, traffic using the Spine Road, 
 especially in the vicinity of the crossroads at Station Road and Cerney Wick 
 lane was becoming increasingly dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians to cross 
 the road. Activities on Lake 11 were attracting spectators in motor cars which 
 were parking in the carriageway or slowing down to get a view inconveniencing 
 and frustrating other road users. He had personally experienced how difficult 
 it was to safely cross over the road and asked that local agencies including 
 Police, CDC and Gloucestershire Highways be made aware of the developing 
 problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VILLAGE PLAN </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Pollard had emailed a revised version of the 
 Village Plan to all concerned and requested all Parish Councillors involved to 
 let her know what progress had been made on the list of its objectives on or 
 before the 4th September in order that she could present an up to date version 
 of the plan to the next Parish Council meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RESURFACING OF A417/A419</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard that this Parish Council supports Latton Parish Council in its 
 criticism of the Highways Agency and its decision to renege on an earlier 
 commitment to resurface the concrete sections of the A417/A419. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. The Clerk was asked to inform Cllr Caunce, Highways 
 representative and Latton Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">DATES OF PARISH COUNCIL COMMITTEE AND PARISH COUNCIL 
 MEETING IN APRIL 2007 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As the Committee meetings on 9th April 2007 would be 
 scheduled for Easter Monday it was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by 
 Cllr Jay that the dates of the Committee meetings and the Parish Council 
 meeting are put forward by one day respectively. To avoid any confusion the 
 Committees would now meet on Tuesday 10th April and the Parish Council on 
 Thursday 12th April. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GLOUCESTERSHIRE HIGHWAYS PARTNERSHIP: QUESTIONNAIRE </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council discussed answering the questionnaire 
 which had been originated by Jeremy Hilton, Liberal Democrat Group Leader GCC. 
 It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Smith that it was too 
 early to make a considered response since the new partnership had only been 
 established for 4 months and one week. The Parish Council was all in favour. 
 The Clerk was asked to point out to Mr Hilton that this Parish Council does not 
 wish to get involved with scoring party political points for any such group.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS REPORTS<br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Pollard suggested that priority of the traffic flow through the 
 junction at Clarks Hay/Station Road and High Street be altered. After a debate 
 the lack of consensus reflected differences in theoretical positions. The 
 Parish Council did agree to refer the question for determination to the sub 
 committee of the Village Plan dealing with highway matters. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb reported that the sign for Gypsy Lane, off 
 Broadway Lane, was missing. The Clerk was asked to inform Cotswold Water Park. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay complained that the proprietors of the Old George 
 public house were using the public footpath between the bridge at Bow Wow and 
 the Chapel to display its sandwich advertising board. He had personally removed 
 it several times but it had been replaced. The Clerk was asked to write to the 
 proprietors of the Old George to request that they refrain from the practice. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to write to the Sailing 
 Club and Mrs Young in Cerney Wick and request that they cut back the 
 overgrowing hedge which adjoins Cerney Wick Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas complained about the state of the road 
 surface especially through the bends in Silver Street and also Broadway Lane. 
 The Clerk was asked to inform Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on a Crime and Disorder Reduction 
 Partnership meeting he had attended on Thursday 10th July. The group comprises 
 Gloucestershire Constabulary, Gloucestershire Police Authority, Cotswold 
 District Council, Gloucestershire County Council, Gloucestershire Fire and 
 Rescue Service and Vale Primary Care Trust. Many other nonstatutory partners 
 now work with the core group to help reduce crime and the fear of crime 
 including representatives from market towns and larger parishes, Victim 
 Support, Registered Social Landlords, Neighbourhood Watch Associates and other 
 specialised services are commissioned to deal with issues such as drug abuse, 
 domestic violence, alcohol abuse and data collection. The group meets every 6 
 weeks to share problems, decide on actions and local initiatives to reduce 
 crime and the fear of crime in local communities. The next meeting was 
 scheduled for 5th September. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the meeting Cllr Stuart met with Sgt Gordon Pearce, 
 among others, who represented the Safer Communities Team and catalogued a 
 series of incidents which had taken place recently in South Cerney. Cllr Stuart 
 is hopeful that a swifter response from the Gloucestershire Constabulary to 
 reported vandalism will now occur. Cllr Stuart again complained that residents 
 were not reporting incidents and because of this South Cerney was not 
 considered a hot spot by the authorities which, in his opinion, was swiftly 
 becoming one. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 10.10pm.</p>
