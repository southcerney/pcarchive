    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 14th September 2005</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when Vice Chairman, Cllr T. Squire 
    welcomed Helen Briggs, Acting Team Leader Cotswolds, Gloucestershire Youth 
    Service and a resident Janet Lodge, who organised youth activities in the 
    village. Miss Briggs distributed a resumé of a consultation which had been 
    carried out with young people from South Cerney aged between 12 and 19. On 
    the whole she reported meeting more young males than females the majority of 
    whom would like to see more facilities for youth in South Cerney. The 
    consultations mainly took place by the flats in Berkeley Close, the Upper Up 
    area and by the Londis shop in Broadway Lane. Cllr Jay said that the 
    formation of a Youth Council would address many of the items on the wish 
    list. In reply to his query on youth numbers in the parish, Miss Briggs 
    informed the meeting that according to a 2001 census there were 198 10-14 
    year olds and 188 in the 15-19 age group. Cllr Caunce noted that youth 
    numbers were similar to other settlements in the county but not reflected in 
    the support given to these communities by the Youth Service. Cllr Jay agreed 
    with Cllr Caunce and stated that the situation needed to be addressed as he 
    had argued that provision of facilities by GCC had been lacking for the past 
    15 years at least. Miss Briggs informed the meeting of a £40,000 investment 
    in a mobile youth club which would come equipped with computers, sports 
    equipment and educational leaflets planned for the near future and she would 
    prioritize its use in the South Cerney area. Cllr Jay was sceptical of how 
    successful it might be and enquired about normal provision of services for 
    the 386 local youths. There was a huge void in the provision of youth 
    services in South Cerney he argued. Cllr Caunce asked Miss Briggs to appoint 
    a staff member to be specifically responsible for the parish of South Cerney 
    and Cerney Wick. A follow up meeting in January 2006 was agreed and the 
    Clerk would write to Miss Briggs giving a report of this meeting copying the 
    letter to Gloucestershire County Council and Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP.</p>

 The Vice Chairman, Cllr Squire opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30pm.<p>
 Cllr Mrs Chapman had made an apology for her absence due to pressure of work. 
 Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr Stuart had sent their apologies for absence as both 
 were on holiday. Cllr Bennett (CDC) had apologised for his absence because of 
 other commitments and Cllr Mrs Clark would not attend because of a private 
 appointment. Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) had also made an apology.</p>

 <p><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p><b>Preaching Cross</b> <br>
 Although GCC Highways did not accept that it was responsible for the 
 refurbishment of the monument it had offered to re-slab the area alongside the 
 cross which Cllr Squire did not consider necessary. He would ask a stonemason 
 to quote to repoint the structure. </p>
 <p><b>CLERK’S REPORT</b> </p>
 <p>On Friday 19th August Inspector Jacka, Cirencester Police, rang to 
 acknowledge my letter regarding recent vandalism. Although PCSO Yeoman was on 
 annual leave Insp. Jacka had passed on the information to a colleague. He was 
 also aware that Les Haines had been in contact over the incidents. He suggested 
 that a surveillance camera be installed in the vicinity of the Upper Up playing 
 fields but presently the only one available was being used on a housing estate 
 in Cirencester. It should be available in the first week of September. I 
 informed him that currently I was collecting responses from Parish Councillors 
 and others about where and when vehicles were exceeding the speed limit. It was 
 agreed that when the schedule was ready it would be copied to him. He said that 
 there was unmanned equipment available from Gary Handley, GCC Road Safety 
 Officer, to monitor traffic speed. On Monday 23rd Jill Portlock GCC Highways 
 informed me that road scalpings would be available at no charge if requested. 
 On Friday 2nd September, myself and Chairman Cllr M. Stuart had a meeting with 
 Les Haines (CDC) at Upper Up car park to determine the best place to site a 
 remote cctv camera to survey activity in the environs of the playing field. Mr 
 Haines agreed to arrange the installation which I am happy to report is now 
 operational. This morning I represented the Parish Council at the official 
 opening of the Pocket Park at Jubilee Gardens. The ceremony was performed by 
 the Chairman of the CDC Cllr Mrs Sue Jepson. Also present were Cllr Mrs Clark 
 (CDC), Martin Hutchings, CDC Development Officer, Christina Gregory, Jephson 
 Housing Association, Joe Watson, Cotswold Estate Services, Edward Hennessy, 
 AFLA, (scheme designers) and Robert Johnston (a Jubilee Gardens’ resident). 
 During August I averaged 3 hours 20 minutes over the 22 available working days 
 which is par for my contract. </p>
 <p><b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT </b></p>
 <p>Cllr Squire asked Cllr Harris to report on the deliberations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on August 8th. </p>
 <p><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p><b>Upper Up Car Park</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had been in contact with Bison Plant Hire regarding the levelling 
 of the Upper Up car park. No definite date had been agreed although the work 
 would be carried out when time permitted. </p>
 <p><b>360 degree swing at Robert Franklin Way play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris has met with Steve Griffiths (Macventure Play Co) and pointed out 
 the movement which takes place at the base of the swing when it is vigorously 
 used. Mr Griffiths would seek advice from the manufacturers and copy the 
 correspondence to the Parish Council. </p>
 <p><b>Damaged Tree in the vicinity of Butchers Cottage</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris agreed that the rowan tree was dead and the Clerk was to ask the 
 Gardening Club what they intended to do about it as it was not a Parish Council 
 issue. </p>
 <p><b>Highway Matters</b> <br>
 Cllr Parsons had informed the Clerk that a protocol was being created to keep 
 the Spine Road clear of mud and débris. It was important that a cleaning 
 machine which would suck the mud rather than brush it was used in the cleaning 
 process. The consultation on the pedestrian/zebra crossing was still taking 
 place. Cllr Parsons expected that the interactive speed signs and the 
 introduction of the new speed limits from South Cerney to Preston Toll Bar to 
 be in force before the end of the current year. Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP 
 will be holding a local surgery in Cirencester shortly and Cllr Parsons would 
 remind him that the obnoxious smells in the vicinity of Kingfisher Place were 
 still a cause of distress to residents. </p>
 <p><b>Millennium Seat, Bow Wow</b> <br>
 On a request from the Committee the Clerk had obtained a verbal quotation of 
 £50 for the repair of the vandalised seat in Bow Wow. It was proposed by Cllr 
 Squire and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council agrees to spend £50 
 on the repair. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p><b>Cerney Wick Churchyard</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that professional tree surgeons would be needed to attend 
 to the overgrowing trees in the churchyard. </p>
 <p><b>Damaged Tree</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had removed the vandalised rowan tree, near the phone box in the 
 vicinity of Butchers’ Cottage. </p>
 <p><b>Overgrowing Rose Tree</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire had contacted the residents at No. 9 The Lennards about the 
 overgrowing rose tree to the rear of their property and they had immediately 
 cut it back. </p>
 <p><b>Weed growth in river Churn</b> <br>
 At a meeting which Chris Blackler (Environment Agency) had with Cllr Jay, Cllr 
 Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart it was determined that the responsibility 
 to keep the river clear was the responsibility of the owner of the Riparian 
 Rights. </p>
 <p><b>Bus Shelter</b> <br>
 The Young Offenders team has repainted the bus shelter twice since the last 
 Parish Council meeting.</p>
 <p><b>Overgrowing Hedge in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire volunteered to contact Mr Peter Spielberg (Lady Fanshawe’s gardner) 
 to arrange for the reduction of the overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p><b>Upper Up play area <br>
 </b>The damaged fireman’s pole attachment on the Activity Area is being 
 repaired by Brian Wheeler, BLW Engineering who will re-make the top fixing 
 bracket and reinstall as soon as possible. Not all abusers of the car park are 
 young drivers. Cllr Stuart reported that a lady with a little boy in her car 
 was seen doing high speed skids on the car park. The Young Offenders team has 
 removed large stones from the car park and repainted the concrete posts. A new 
 litter picker called “Carol” has been observed collecting rubbish off the 
 playing field whilst walking her dog. The Unpaid Work Unit has been booked to 
 lift the safety tiles during the second week of October. </p>
 <p><b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that three bolts were missing from the train unit in the 
 toddlers play area. Cllr Harris offered to replace the bolts. It was proposed 
 by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Caunce that James Harris replaces the 
 missing bolts. The Committee was all in favour. On the senior swings one nut 
 needs to be tightened. There was some new grafitti on the tower slide unit. The 
 pyracantha stumps need to be trimmed again. </p>
 <p><b>Cerney Wick play area <br>
 </b>Cllr Caunce intends to remove the broken bough from the tree on the 
 southern side of the playing field. </p>
 <p><b>CALOR VILLAGE OF THE YEAR PRIZES</b> </p>
 <p>Cllr Harris suggested that the prize money be spent on projects such as a 
 wall to kick football against which would benefit the youth of the parish. 
 Another scheme might be the creation of meanders in the river Churn to 
 encourage a better flow pattern and lessen the growth of weeds. Finally, he 
 would welcome a project to complete the wet land area at Upper Up. </p>
 <p><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p><b>Fenland Leisure Products Ltd</b> <br>
 An order acknowledgement had been received from Fenland Leisure Products Ltd. 
 On a suggestion from Cllr Jay that an inspection of the finished installation 
 be made by a safety inspector, the Clerk had contacted John Hicks who had 
 carried out safety inspections for the Parish Council in the past. Mr Hicks 
 informed the Clerk that it was crucial the surface conformed to British 
 Standards specifically in relation to the critical fall height or ‘Head Injury 
 Criterion’ (HIC). Further, if the material to be installed is suitable, then 
 there will be a test report from a reputable test house or agency which 
 incorporates a number of matters but particularly a critical fall height figure 
 from which is derived the maximum height of fall guaranteed to be protected 
 (which should be at or more than the accessible fall height at each location) 
 and this will also indicate the minimum depth of installation as appropriate 
 which a post installation inspection would measure by probing or other means. 
 BSEN 1177-1997-5.1 requires suppliers to provide inter alia product performance 
 figures and so it is reasonable to ask for copies or at least sight of the 
 above information as part of the contract. The contract should also certify 
 that the area and extent of surfacing as well as the new access aids to slide 
 equipment are in all respects in conformity to BS requirements. </p>
 <p>It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Jay that provided Mr 
 George Taylor (Fenland Ltd) guarantees that the installation and equipment 
 conforms to British Standards, the Clerk is authorised by the Parish Council to 
 sign the acceptance order. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire reported that water was leaking out from the pavement between 16 
 and 18 Sudeley Drive and asked the Clerk to inform GCC Highways. Cllr Squire 
 asked the Clerk to arrange a meeting with Gillian Portlock to discuss the state 
 of the river bank in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p><b>FINANCE</b> <br>
 Cllr Smith reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met 
 on 12th September.</p>
 <p><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 <b>Correspondence <br>
 </b>No reply had been received from the CDC regarding the offer to purchase the 
 land at Jubilee Gardens. A quotation from Mr Francis to lay tarmacadam on the 
 car park at Upper Up was awaited.<br>
 <b>Grass Cutting</b> <br>
 Grass cutting cuts for this current year and those of last year. Please note 
 that the VAT element is inconsistent as some contractors are registered and 
 others are not.</p>

 <p><b>Financial Report <br>
 </b>Cllr Smith, Chairman of the 
 Finance Committee presented a schedule of finance matters which detailed items 
 requiring action, budget planning and other issues not requiring direct Parish 
 Council financial assistance. He asked the Clerk to copy the Budget Plan for 
 2005-06 to all Parish Councillors and tasked him to provide Parish Councillors 
 with a spreadsheet of Parish Council expenses each month. Cllr Smith would 
 discuss these matters as an agenda item at next month’s Parish Council meeting.

 <b>Village Plan</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas 
 commented that there was no mention of planning issues in the draft Village 
 Plan and cited the future of the CAMAS site, further holiday homes and light 
 pollution as subjects which should be included.  </p>

 Erection of two (2)

 The proposed size would be intrusive on neighbours privacy. The materials to be

 OBJECTION  </p>
 <p>It was proposed by Cllr 
 Smith and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council accepts the 
 deliberations of the Planning Committee on the remaining applications. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour.  </p>

 Non-illuminated 
 free-standing advertising board at Spring Lake Brasserie, South Cerney The 
 Committee noted that a Condition of the Consent granted stated “the existing 
 signs together with all means of support shall be removed from the application 
 site in their entirety before the advertisement sign hereby authorised is first 
 placed on display.” The reason given for this Condition is “to preclude the 
 build-up of unnecessary advertisements on the application site to the detriment 
 of the visual amenity.”  </p>
 <p>There is concern that this Condition is not being 
 obeyed as advertising signs are still in place at the junction of Station Road, 
 Spine Road and Cerney Wick Lane. Earlier this year there was a fatal accident 
 involving a young man from Fairford and a lorry at this junction and although 
 the coroner has yet to determine the cause, a contributory factor might well be 
 the distraction created by the multiplicity of advertising at this point. The 
 Clerk was to ask Mr M. Grace (Enforcement Officer CDC) to investigate.  </p>
 <p><b>Item to 
 Task file</b> <br>
 <b>CT.2648/3/E</b> <br>
 Temporary use of existing building as a fishing equipment 
 shop in association with existing fisheries on Lakes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 16 at 
 Lake 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney <br>
 Conditions of note: 2. By 5th 
 September 2008, the permitted use shall stop. Unless further planning 
 permission is granted in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the 
 expiry date, the use permitted shall permanently cease. Reason: To enable the 
 Local Planning Authority to give further consideration to the acceptability of 
 the proposed use after the temporary period has expired. This condition is 
 attached in the light of Circular 11/95. <br>
 3. The application site shall be used 
 only for the sale of fishing equipment and for no other purpose, including any 
 other purpose in Class A1 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use 
 Classes) Order 2005 or the equivalent to that Class in any statutory instrument 
 amending or replacing the 2005 Order or any other change of use permitted by 
 the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. 
 Reason: It is essential that the Local Planning Authority retains control over 
 the use of the premises because unrestricted retail development may not be 
 acceptable in an open countryside location. Another planning application will 
 be necessary if it is proposed to change the use of the premises to any use 
 other than that specified in this condition. This condition is appropriate in 
 the light of advice within PPS1 and Circular 11/95.  </p>

 The Parish Council was minded to agree with a 
 suggestion from Cllr Jay that the money be used to hire a marquee for extra 
 days prior to the Street Fair for use by village interests, subject to Raymond 
 Fenton’s approval.  </p>
 <p><b>UPPER UP WET LAND AREA</b> </p>
 <p>The Parish Council is minded that 
 funds be allocated in the next budget to allow for the completion of the 
 planting of the wet land north of the lake on the Upper Up playing field. 
  
 </p>
 <p><b>VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>
 <p>Besides comments earlier from Cllr Nicholas (see page 2015), Cllr 
 Jay asked the Clerk to contact Cllr Mrs Pollard to arrange a meeting of the 
 Village Plan Committee to consider the final draft of the plan before it is 
 presented to the full Parish Council.  </p>
 <p><b>COTSWOLD WATER PARK FUND</b> </p>
 <p>The Clerk was 
 asked to write to Ms Sophia Price (CDC) with a wish list of Parish Council 
 projects which might benefit from S.106 money allocated through the Four 
 Pillars hotel development. The Clerk was to emphasise that this Parish Council 
 as part of the Cotswold District Council’s Water Park Ward was eminently 
 geographically situated to benefit from such a fund. Parish Council projects 
 which had particular relevance to the Water Park and South Cerney such as the 
 landscaping of the Upper Up wet land and the bridge to connect the 
 pathway/cycle path from Upper Up through to Keynes Park seek funds for their 
 implementation. Facilities for the youth of the parish such as youth shelters, 
 a skateboard park and a football wall were also vying for funds.  </p>

 <p><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p>Parish Councillors’ were concerned about the 
 numbers of Bloor Homes directions which had been affixed to various posts 
 throughout the village. The Clerk was to ascertain from GCC Highways if the 
 high concentration of such notices was in order. <br>
 The Clerk was asked to notify 
 CDC that when the new road arrangements come into force in Berkeley Close a new 
 sign from the Leaze will have to be made to inform the public of the changes.<br>
 Cllr Jay informed the meeting that PCSO Yeoman had requested access to the 
 Village Hall to store some of his equipment when he takes up duty. The Clerk 
 was asked to invite him to report on his first month’s duty at the next meeting 
 of the Parish Council.<br>
 Cllr Nicholas gave a report on his attendance at the 
 latest Flood Forum on 12th September. Generally, the Forum was kept informed of 
 continuing work in progress. Cllr Nicholas raised the Bloor Homes development 
 now taking place, highlighting Conditions 12 and 23 of the planning permission 
 which stated that the development shall not begin until drainage works have 
 been permanently carried out in accordance with details first approved in 
 writing by CDC. Cllr Berry (CDC) suggested at the meeting that if there was a 
 concern that planning permission Conditions were not being met then the CDC 
 Enforcement Officer should be asked to monitor the situation. <br>
 Parish 
 Councillors agreed with Cllr Squire who suggested that if the cctv installation 
 proved a success at Upper Up car park then the Parish Council should consider a 
 permanent camera be installed.</p>
 <p>There being no further business Cllr Squire closed the meeting at 10.10pm</td>
