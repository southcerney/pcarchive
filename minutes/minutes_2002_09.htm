    tragedy which had occurred in the United States of America one year ago today.<br>
    <br>

    Apologies had been received from Cllr Dunn, Cllr Gardiner, Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Mrs

    ... signs. ­ move to under next heading CT.2648/2/Y before NO OBJECTION.<br>
    Page 3 ­ CT.5804/R and CT.5804/S are notification of intention statements and not
    planning permissions. Cllr Jones (CDC) pointed out that the Cotswold District Council does
    not have jurisdiction over planning matters on Crown property.<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Minutes as
    amended, were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council, with the exception of Cllr
    Nicholas who was not present at the meeting was all in favour and the Minutes were signed
    by the Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    It was agreed that any Matters Arising would be dealt with at the Committee report stages
    of this meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on<br>
    9 September.<br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that there was concern from neighbours that large trees had been
    removed from the gardens at Orchard House. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) stated that as far as she
    was aware the owner was not in breach of any regulation but that she would check with Mr
    G. Watson at CDC. Cllr Jones (CDC) said that any tree work in a Conservation Area must
    have permission. Cllr Nicholas queried whether the large decking area which stood
    approximately 2ft high, supported by concrete walls, required planning permission. Cllr
    Mrs Clark (CDC) would check this out. The Clerk was asked to write to CDC Planning
    querying: 1. How much more of the fence is to be built? 2. How long is the
    &quot;temporary&quot; fence to be in place? 3. Did the removal of the trees, post the
    visit by Mr Grace, have permission? 4. Is planning permission required for the decking and
    associated wall on the north boundary?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hedge at Orchard House</strong><br>
    There had been no reply from Mr G.Watson regarding the composition of the replacement
    hedge at Orchard House.<br>
    <strong>Parking on Public Open Space at the Limes</strong><br>
    Rosie Hammond had written to apologise for parking on the public open space in front of
    her house.<br>
    <strong>Westbury Homes Section 106 Agreement for Phase I of the Limes</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas recommended that the Parish Council asks Miss V. Hancock of Davey Son &amp;
    Jones' Solicitors to implement the transfer of land as detailed in the Section 106
    Agreement and to enquire if she recalled what, if any, arrangements were made concerning
    payment of the Parish Council's legal fees for the transfer. Parish Council agreed.<br>
    <strong>Watermark Advertisement</strong><br>
    The Parish Council asked the Clerk to contact Mr Grace, Enforcement Officer (South) to
    determine if an advertisement sign on the corner of the Watermark development at the
    junction of Station Road and the Spine Road was in accordance with planning regulations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    CT.0776/M<br>
    Erection of detached dwelling on land adjacent to Walnut Tree Farmhouse, Upper Up, South
    Cerney<br>
    The proposed new vehicular entrance is too close to the bend in the road. It is suggested
    that any new dwelling on this site should be required to share use of the existing
    driveway immediately to the east. Also, it is suggested that a new pavement should be
    created along the southern side of the public highway, between the existing driveway and
    the Upper Up car park.<br>
    OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    CT.0807/U<br>

    Demolition of toilet block, erection of new buildings containing retail, office, cafe,
    exhibition and associated accommodation, car park and landscaping<br>
    If permission is granted the Parish Council would like a tanalised finish to<br>
    the cladding.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    CT.8163/D<br>
    Construction of new dry stone boundary wall 2m high to rear of house and widening of
    entrance at Orchard House, Upper Up, South Cerney (minor amendment)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council agrees
    to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to ratify its decisions. The
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Permission/Listed Building consent granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.3929/P<br>
    Loft conversion (installation of dormer windows into rear elevation of existing dwelling)
    at 1 Willow Grove, South Cerney, GL7 5UU<br>
    <br>
    CT.4086/C<br>
    Retention of new external flue for boiler in roof at 5 Edwards College, South Cerney, GL7
    5TR<br>
    <br>
    CT.4125/1/G<br>
    The erection of a conservatory to the rear at 26 Beverstone Road, South Cerney, GL7 5XU<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Permission/Listed Building Consent refused by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.0650/C<br>
    Conversion to two dwellings plus the erection of four further dwellings at Old Post
    Office, High Street, South Cerney, GL7 5UG<br>
    CDC gave the following reasons for its refusal:<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application site is prominent within South Cerney
    ConservationArea and affects the setting of Thrift Cottage, a Grade II listed building.
    The Local Planning Authority is required to have regard to the preservation or enhancement
    of the character or appearance of conservation areas and to preserve the historic setting
    of listed buildings. By virtue of its unsympathetic form, scale and layout, the proposal
    would be harmful to the character and appearance of the conservation area and to the
    setting of the nearby listed building. Consequently, the proposal would fail to accord
    with the guidance provided within PPG1 and PPG15, Gloucestershire Structure Plan Second
    Review Policies S6 and NHE6 and Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 27, 29 and 40.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application site is enclosed on three sides by existing
    residential development. By virtue of their close proximity to existing adjoining
    boundaries, the scale and pattern of fenestration of the new dwellings would create a
    material loss of privacy to private garden areas. Consequently, the proposal would fail to
    accord with the guidance provided by PPG1 and Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1 and
    44.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed vehicular access to Plot D does not incorporate adequate
    turning facilities to enable vehicles to enter and leave the highway in forward gear with
    the result that vehicles would have to reverse to or from the Class 3 County highway,
    contrary to the interests of highway safety in accordance with PPG13 and Cotswold District
    Local Plan Policies 1 and 46.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed vehicular accessing, parking and turning arrangements
    for Plots A, B, C, E and F are substandard in layout and do not comply with the minimum
    standards necessary to serve the proposed development with the result that vehicles would
    be likely to park along and reverse to and from the Class 3 County highway, contrary to
    the interests of highway safety in accordance with PPG13 and Cotswold District Local Plan
    Policies 1 and 46.<br>
    <br>
    CT.5684/H<br>
    Listed building consent for additional advertisement at The Eliot Arms, Clarks Hay, South
    Cerney, GL7 5UA<br>
    <br>
    CT.5684/J<br>
    Projecting sign to display an advertisement at The Eliot Arms, Clarks Hay, South Cerney,

    &nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT.4528/H ­ Appeal dismissed. Cllr Nicholas declared a
    professional interest and read the reasons for the decision without comment.<br>
    &nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT.0006/3/L ­ R. H. Wrightson ­ Copy letter to CDC<br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on 9
    September.<br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    Response from Audit Commission<br>
    The Clerk reported that no reply had been received.<br>
    Fixed Asset Values<br>
    Cllr Nicholas again argued that Upper Up and Robert Franklin Way playing fields should not
    be valued nominally at £1 in the Parish Council's accounts but that the Supporting
    Statement properly reported their true value.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Payments</strong><br>
    Petty Cash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bus Shelter Cleansing (September)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £40.00<br>
    GPFA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subscription&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £50.00<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £1,023.12<br>
    Rodney Gardiner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground Maintenance Cerney Wick (August)
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £78.35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £1,928.28<br>
    Cllr Nicholas inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for August.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr King that the Parish Council agrees
    to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Payments Received</strong><br>
    Environment Agency&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return of abstraction fee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £50.00<br>
    Westbury Homes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 106 Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £13,000.00
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £13,050.00<br>
    Westbury Homes S.106 Agreement payments re The Limes<br>
    It was suggested by Cllr Nicholas that, although £8,000 of the funds received from
    Westbury Homes was paid as a commuted sum to defray future cost to the Parish Council of
    maintaining the public open spaces at The Limes, the Council could nevertheless decide to
    use those funds now for other pressing purposes e.g. for play equipment, and instead meet
    those maintenance costs from future revenue. It was agreed that this suggestion was worth
    considering. With regard to the £5,000 received from Westbury for &quot;off-site play
    equipment&quot; it was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr King that these
    funds be specifically earmarked for the Robert Franklin Way playground; the Parish Council
    was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Outstanding Account</strong><br>
    South Cerney Football Club&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water services 4 March to 18 June
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £18.59<br>
    The Clerk informed the Committee that he had written again to Mrs V. Cole Football Club
    Treasurer but had no reply. He had left messages for Mrs K. Allen Football Club Secretary
    and Gordon Stratford to make contact all to no avail. Cllr Stuart remarked that Mr
    Stratford was currently on holiday but should return next week.<br>
    Upper Up Park<br>
    Cllr Nicholas suggested that Mr J. Harris be asked to consider tendering for the Upper Up
    Park project. Cllr Harris declared an interest and left the meeting. Cllr Nicholas was
    concerned that if Cllr Harris was to be implicated the Parish Council could be handing him
    a poisoned chalice. The Parish Council decided that it would not be advisable to involve
    Cllr Harris because of his prior close involvement with the scheme. Cllr Harris returned
    to the meeting and was informed of its decision. The Parish Council then discussed a
    reduced scheme which would implement planning permission. Cllr Harris stated that ways
    must be found to reduce costs, for example, by possibly postponing the gazebo feature.<br>
    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br>
    27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arnold-Baker Local Council Administration 6th Edition. Offer Price
    &nbsp; £37.60<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish
    Council authorises this purchase. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLCC ­ A Clerk's home study course and quick reference guide ­
    £130<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr King that the Parish
    Council authorises this purchase. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 9 September.<br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    Street Lighting<br>
    The Clerk had nothing further to report.<br>
    Upper Up Tower Slide<br>
    Three companies had been contacted regarding the refurbishment of the Tower Slide but all
    declined. Their unanimous advice was to contact the original suppliers. Cllr Harris had
    measured the dimensions (2m x 1m) for a scramble net frame which could be attached to the
    slide to make access easier. He recommended that a quotation be obtained for the frame
    from En Tout Cas. Cllr King recommended that when the modification was complete the Parish
    Council commissions a safety report.<br>
    Ramp at Upper Up<br>
    Damage estimated by the builder of £500 had been caused by a vehicle to the partly
    constructed wall of the ramp. The Clerk reported that he had contacted Cornhill Insurance
    to ascertain if the damage was covered. Cornhill Insurance advised that as the
    construction was not a specified item the company was not liable. However, it also advised
    that when completed the ramp should be added to the Schedule as a special item for
    insurance purposes. Cllr Harris noted that the visibility from the ramp to the carriageway
    was obstructed by the retaining wall and as it was now necessary to rebuild the wall it
    provided an opportunity to change its design. Cllr Gardiner had informed the Clerk that he
    had negotiated with TD Construction to slope the top of the supporting wall when it is
    rebuilt.<br>
    Willow Trees<br>
    Cllr Harris is continuing to liaise with Virginia McClure on what work is required and she
    will contact the landowner Mr R. Webb. Cllr King brought to the attention of the Parish
    Council a tree incident in a South West Parish where that Council had been held
    responsible for an accident. He proposed that an inventory be made of all trees which were
    the responsibility of the Parish Council. Cllr Stuart and Cllr Harris agree to carry out
    this task and report their findings to the next Parish Council meeting in October.<br>
    Hedge at Upper Up<br>
    James Harris Contracting has trimmed the hedge at Upper Up for the sum of £20.<br>
    Maintenance of Public Open Space at Limes<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd be asked to include grass
    cutting to the front of the Limes for the remainder of the season.<br>
    Trees on The Piece<br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest. Two quotes had been received for a reduced tree surgery
    project. The Parish Council was concerned that the earlier decision on a larger scheme had
    not been adhered to. The Clerk was asked to contact the previous tenderers and ask them
    for new quotations.<br>
    Street Signs<br>
    Mrs Roberts had telephoned the Clerk to complain that there were no street signs for
    Cirencester Road. The Parish Council asked that Mr R. Bull (CDC) be informed.<br>
    Upper Up Camping<br>
    Cllr Harris was called out by Mrs Berry of Crossroads Farm as youths were camping on the
    playing fields and creating a nuisance there. He gave them permission to stay that night
    but no longer.<br>
    Ham Lane Tree Clearance<br>
    Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to thank D. Taylor (Gloucestershire Highways) for his prompt
    action in clearing the dead trees bordering Ham Lane and Sudeley Drive.<br>
    Bledisloe Cup<br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that the Bledisloe Cup had been returned.<br>
    <strong>Correspondence</strong><br>
    &nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removal of branch obstruction on public footpath<br>
    13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parking on public open space at the Limes<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A letter from Rosie Hammond apologised for her unlawful car parking outside
    her home although she did complain about the use of the unfinished sub station by youths
    and others. Cllr Harris recommended that the electricity board be asked for a completion
    date for the structure. Parish Council agreed.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris read Cllr Stuart's inspection report. At Upper Up playing field he had noted
    that the safety tiles were lifting and could become a trip hazard. Seats on the senior
    swing were badly split and must be renewed as soon as possible. The replacement seats had
    been delivered and would be fitted as soon as practicable. On the Activity Area the pole
    is loose and the securing top nuts needed to be tightened. Cllr Harris stated that it was
    designed to be so and was not a danger. On the Basketball Frame new chains are required to
    form a basket and the lines have almost disappeared. In the corner of the car park there
    is a pile of gravel and debris. To secure entry from the car park to the rest of the
    playing field the catch on the field gate needs to be adjusted. Cllr Harris volunteered to
    inspect the lock and report to the next Parish Council meeting. Generally it will be
    necessary to remove heavy litter. Cllr Stuart reported that the new ramp access had been
    damaged. The car park at Upper Up had been enlarged and was much better. The Football Club
    have commented very favourably. At the western end of the playing field children had
    constructed a BMX type ramp which was approved by Parish Councillors who had seen it. The
    Clerk was asked to inform Cornhill Insurance of this new asset and arrange suitable cover.
    The facility will be added to the weekly inspection schedule. At Robert Franklin Way
    playing field poles at the corner of the swing were rotted through but advised that no
    action was required yet. Tiles at the Slide were lifting and could cause a trip hazard.
    Children he met on his inspection asked if it was possible to install a skateboard area.
    At Cerney Wick play area surfaces with tiles needed to be swept and the tiles were lifting
    in places. The fence and hedge were much improved but two rails on right against pony
    paddock needed to be repaired. Cllr Mrs Chubb will carry out the inspections for the
    coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that further contractors are still being sought to tender for the
    work.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris noted that in the north west corner of Robert Franklin Way playing field a
    protective fence was required on the southern river bank. Cllr Mrs Chubb had complaints
    about the growth of weeds in the ditch in Station Road. Cllr Harris advised and Cllr King
    agreed that attention to the perceived problem would have to wait until the growth had
    died back to prevent the resulting debris from blocking the ditch.<br>
