    Prior to the meeting Cllr Jay informed the Parish Council that past Chairman 
    of the Parish Council, Dr Michael Bride was in hospital in France after 
    suffering a stroke. The Parish Council hoped that he would make a speedy 
    recovery.<br>
    <br>
    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman had made an apology for her absence due to another 
    commitment. Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Baines (CDC) had both apologised for 
    their absences due to other commitments.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 13th JULY 2005</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Minutes were 
    a true and accurate record. Besides Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Smith who 
    abstained as they had not attended the meeting, the Parish Council was all 
    in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Vandalism at Upper Up and Bus Shelter</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to report two acts of vandalism at Upper Up. In one 
    instance another tree had been broken and vehicles had disturbed the 
    recently scraped gravel surface of the car park which would necessitate the 
    work being done again. Obscene graffiti had been applied to both internal 
    faces of the front elevation of the bus shelter by the Cross.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Wednesday 3rd August I attended a meeting of the Committee dealing with 
    the Village Plan. Also present were Cllr Jay, Cllr Pollard, Cllr Stuart, 
    Cllr Webb, Patrick Mills, Mel Tarrant (GRCC), Dr Peter Stephenson and Steven 
    Walker. Of the 11 available working days in July, due of my recent vacation, 
    I averaged 4 hours 45 minutes per day which is somewhat in excess of my 
    contract. This extra time is accounted for as mail, email, planning 
    applications, messages on my answerphone continue unabated during my absence 
    and must be attended to on my return.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING FROM ANNUAL PARISH MEETING</b><br>
    <b>Traffic Speed</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Smith that the Clerk 
    prepare a schedule of where vehicles were most likely to speed. Parish 
    Councillors would inform the Clerk of instances in the vicinity of where 
    they lived. Mrs Roberts who lives at the Pines on Cirencester Road should 
    also be contacted for her opinion. On receipt of replies the Clerk would 
    then forward the schedule to Sgt Rawlings (Gloucestershire Constabulary) for 
    appropriate action. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Licensing</b><br>
    Cllr Jay pointed out that there were discrepancies in the report from Cllr 
    Bennett (CDC). For example the cost of new licences would be based on the 
    rateable value of the property for which the licence was granted. There was 
    concern that only 12 temporary licences per annum would be granted to the 
    Village Hall and these could be applied for by anyone. It was probable that 
    applicants, other than the Village Hall, might exhaust the set number 
    possibly leaving no applied for licences available. The Village Hall did not 
    have the right to be informed when licences were applied for by others. One 
    alternative would be for the Village Hall to apply for a full licence but 
    that would compromise Parish Council meetings which by law cannot be held in 
    licensed premises.<br>
    <b>Obnoxious Smells</b><br>
    Mr Richard Wrightson a resident of Kingfisher Place had asked that action be 
    taken to stop the smell of sewerage at the eastern part of the village. Cllr 
    Parsons (GCC) would be raising the matter with Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP.<br>
    <br>
    <b>SAFETY SURFACES</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Jay that George Taylor 
    of Fenplay Ltd be ordered to proceed with the installation of the new 
    surfaces. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Squire had been in contact with Hills who had agreed to allow the 
    Parish Council to dump the non-hazardous tiles at its site near the bottom 
    of Blunsdon Hill at no cost except the £18 per ton land fill tax. The Clerk 
    was asked to inform Mike Weston (Hills) that the approximate weight of the 
    material would not exceed one ton. Cllr Caunce would arrange a working party 
    to lift the tiles at Cerney Wick play area. Cllr Stuart would liaise with 
    the Unpaid Works Unit to see if it was possible to use its labour to remove 
    the tiles.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Jay that sufficient Euro 
    Mesh is purchased to protect the play equipment affected when the safety 
    surfaces were removed. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village 
    Maintenance Committee which had met on 8th August.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>360 degree swing at Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    The Clerk had contacted Steve Griffiths in person who informed him that he 
    had not been aware of previous messages given to his employee requesting 
    that he inspect the apparatus the supports of which had been reported to 
    move when used vigorously. Mr Griffiths would inspect the kit on 17th 
    August.<br>
    <b>Missing Spindle on apparatus at Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Ian Fairbrother had replaced the spindle but vandals had removed it once 
    again. Mr Fairbrother had once again replaced it. Although the spindle had 
    not been painted it was not deemed necessary as the equipment would be 
    removed in the autumn.<br>
    <b>Calor Gloucestershire Village of the Year</b><br>
    South Cerney was awarded £500 as winner of the Safer Villages category and a 
    further £500 as winner of the Environment category. Cllr Jay said that 
    congratulations to Cllr Harris for the effort he made in constructing the 
    pond, cycle mounds etc. The Parish Council agreed and was in favour of a 
    request by Cllr Harris that the use of the prize money be an agenda item for 
    September.<br>
    <b>Barrier on old railway track</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the barrier had been erected although the routed 
    message had not been inscribed. The Clerk was to ask Mr T. Pain, Cotswold 
    Water Park Society Ltd when the routing could be expected and the proposed 
    message to read “Horse Riders – Walking Pace, Straight On Only”. The Clerk 
    was to enquire if the gate could be secured to prevent unauthorised abuse.<br>
    <b>War Memorial</b><br>
    Allianz Cornhill had added the War Memorial and the Preaching Cross to the 
    insurance policy for £76.32 which was somewhat less than its original 
    quotation.<br>
    <b>Preaching Cross</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had spoken to Martyn Summerell GCC Highways to find out if it 
    was prepared to make a donation towards the refurbishment of the cross. Cllr 
    Squire was hopeful of a successful outcome.<br>
    <b>Bus Shelter</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that obscene graffiti had been applied to both internal 
    faces of the front elevation of the bus shelter. He would liaise with the 
    Unpaid Works Unit on its refurbishment. Cllr Jay said that the Village Hall 
    would supply the paint.<br>
    <b>New Bus Shelter</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had nothing further to report regarding a possible source of 
    funding for a new bus shelter.<br>
    <b>Damaged Tree</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had removed the rowan tree which had been snapped off by 
    vandals, near the phone box in the vicinity of Butchers’ Cottage.<br>
    <b>Trees in Clarks Hay</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had inspected the nearly dead trees in Clarks Hay but considered 
    that they should be left in situ at present.<br>
    <b>Overgrowing Rose Tree</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the overgrowing tree on the pathway from 
    Station Road to Bow Wow was within the curtilage of No. 9 The Lennards and 
    asked the Clerk to request that it be cut back.<br>
    <b>Weed growth in river Churn</b><br>
    The Environment Agency stated that it was the responsibility of adjacent 
    property owners to keep the river clear. It had suggested a site meeting for 
    further discussion which the Clerk was asked to arrange. Cllr Jay, Cllr 
    Squire and Cllr Stuart expressed an interest in attending such a meeting.<br>
    <br>
    As Cllr Parsons (GCC) had another meeting to attend the Chairman, Cllr 
    Stuart agreed to promote his report.<br>
    Cllr Parsons (GCC) informed the Parish Council that shortly he would be 
    attending a meeting of interested parties to take forward the following 
    outstanding items which included the problem of mud on the Spine Road, 
    installation of the interactive speed signs, how the consultation on the 
    pedestrian crossing was progressing, the introduction of lower speed limits 
    on the South Cerney to Preston Toll Bar road although only one objection had 
    been made to the proposal which the Parish Council was unanimous in the 
    opposing view. He would involve Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP in trying to 
    solve the nuisance of bad smells in the Kingfisher Place area. Cllr Jay 
    reminded Cllr Parsons (GCC) that representatives from the Youth Service had 
    been invited to attend the next meeting of the Parish Council on 14th 
    September. Cllr Parsons noted an observation from Cllr Squire about the poor 
    state of the surface of Broadway Lane. Cllr Parsons left the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Brian Wheeler, BLW Engineering had inspected the damaged fireman’s pole 
    attachment on the Activity Area and would make a repair. The weeds on the 
    cycle mounds had been strimmed. James Harris had removed the dead trees and 
    informed the donors that the Parish Council will pay for their replacement. 
    The gaps in the rubber safety tiles had noticeably increased due to the hot 
    and dry spell of weather. Sebastian Genillard and friends, with the 
    permission of Cllr Stuart, had at their own expense organised a digger to 
    redesign part of the cycle mounds. Cllr Stuart suggested that if the job was 
    completed with time to spare for the car park to be scraped, the Parish 
    Council should consider sharing the cost with the group. The Parish Council 
    agreed that £100 be paid to the group. Unfortunately, overnight the levelled 
    car park was disturbed by vehicles abusing the surface. Cllr Harris would 
    ask Bison if it might consider relevelling the area as a good will gesture. 
    The Clerk was asked to notify the police of the incident. Cllr Squire stated 
    that the Parish Council should seriously consider locking up the car park 
    over night. A long term remedy would be to apply tarmac but that would 
    undoubtedly be an expensive solution. The Clerk was to enquire from Mr 
    Christopher Francis of Box Bush how much it might cost. Cllr Stuart and the 
    Clerk would compose a suitable article for publication in the Cerney News 
    about the incident. Cllr Stuart reported that a second tree had been damaged 
    at Upper Up and asked the Clerk to report the incident to the police.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that there was no further deterioration in the movement 
    of the legs on the 360 degree swing. The spindle on the tower slide had been 
    replaced again but not painted. Under the Hags play unit there was some rot 
    on a post under filled area. The pyracantha stumps had been resprayed. A 
    gate had been erected as a horse barrier although no additional fencing had 
    been installed. There was no routed message to horse riders on the gate.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the safety tiles on the play area were lifting. 
    One bough was broken off and further work on others was needed which Cllr 
    Caunce volunteered to do.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CORRESPONDENCE</b><br>
    Mrs Gardner of Station Road had written to complain that she had not had a 
    reply about her concern that with the weeds growing in the Station Road 
    ditch. The Clerk explained that the delay was due to his being on holiday.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to request that Lady Fanshawe cut the hedge on 
    her boundary with Bow Wow from Lower Mill to the bridge near Lower Churn.<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the footpath parallel to Wildmoorway Lane 
    alongside Andy’s Lake is badly overgrown. The Clerk will inform the Cotswold 
    Water Park Society.<br>
    Cllr Stuart would liaise with Andy Beard on the repair to the Millennium 
    seat in Bow Wow.<br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Smith reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had 
    met on 8th August.<br>
    Matters Arising<br>
    Grass Cutting<br>
    Grass cutting cuts for this current year and those of last year. Please note 
    that the VAT element is inconsistent as some contractors are registered and 
    others are not.<br>

    1. The application site is prominent within South Cerney Conservation Area 
    and affects the setting of Thrift Cottage, a Grade II listed building. The 
    Local Planning Authority is required to have regard to the preservation or 
    enhancement of the character or appearance of conservation areas and to 
    preserve the historic setting of listed buildings. By virtue of its 
    unsympathetic form, design and detailing, the proposal would be harmful to 
    the character and appearance of the conservation area and to the setting of 
    the nearby listed building. Consequently, the proposal would fail to accord 
    with the guidance provided within PPS1 and PPG15, Gloucestershire Structure 
    Plan 2nd Review Policies S6 and NHE6 and Cotswold District Local Plan 
    Policies 1, 27, 29 and 40.<br>
    2. The application site is enclosed on three sides by existing residential 
    development. By virtue of their close proximity to existing adjoining 
    boundaries, the position and amount of fenestration of the new buildings 
    would create a material loss of privacy to the occupants of a nearby 
    dwelling and associated private garden area. Consequently, the proposal 
    would fail to accord with the guidance provided by PPS1 and Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policies 1 and 44.<br>

    <b>FLOOD FORUM REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas gave a report on a Flood Forum meeting he had attended on 17th 
    June.<br>
    The outstanding investigation of the sewerage and surface water drains was 
    on going but conditions i.e. the height of the water table around the system 
    must be sufficient and the last two years had been exceptionally dry. There 
    was an accepted problem that ground water was seeping into the sewerage 
    system and there was a scheme in hand to check the minor sewerage drains 
    with a satellite tracking device. Any investment in updating the system 
    would be calculated on a cost/benefit ratio to determine the priority of the 
    work. Mr Adams, the representative from Thames Water, was confident that the 
    Station Road pumping station was well capable of handling the current 
    throughput and would also cope with the planned increased development 
    alongside the Spine Road. Mr Adams was not aware of the bad smell of 
    sewerage in the Kingfisher Place area and advised that residents should 
    record their complaints as evidence. Cllr Nicholas would advise Mr &amp; Mrs 
    Chapman on the outcome of the meeting and expected to attend the next Flood 
    Forum scheduled for 9th September.<br>
    <br>
    <b>LAND AT JUBILEE GARDENS</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish 
    Council offers the Cotswold District Council a nominal sum of £1 for the 
    remaining ground at Jubilee Gardens to preserve its integrity and prevent 
    further development thereof.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ PORTFOLIO REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Jay informed the Parish Council that his Health Portfolio would be 
    addressed in the forthcoming Village Plan.<br>
    Cllr Webb noted that the grant to the Village Hall, no longer covered the 
    cost of its insurance.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard stated that she was working on the draft Village Plan which 
    she hoped to present to the Parish Council soon.<br>
