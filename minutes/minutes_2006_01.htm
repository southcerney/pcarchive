 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Meeting with PCSO</b> <br>
 Parish Councillors agreed with Cllr Webb who suggested that the Parish Council 
 writes to the PCSOs superior and suggest that the officer might be encouraged 
 to use public transport to and from South Cerney. The PCSO had mentioned that 
 one of his difficulties in patrolling South Cerney was access to transport from 
 Cirencester. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Plan</b> <br>
 After consultation with Mel Tarrant (GRCC) who was very pleased with the plan 
 and its content, Cllr Jay had produced a final draft. Minor revisions were 
 agreed and Cllr Jay gave the assembled Parish Councillors 24 hours to notify 
 any further alterations after which time production would begin.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Parish Council<br>

 forward him names of youngsters who might be willing to participate.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 5th January I attended a meeting of the 
 Finance Committee at The Old Police House, to discuss budget proposals for the 
 next financial year April 2006 to end of March 2007. In attendance were Cllr 
 Jay, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Smith, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb. Cllr Squire had 
 emailed an apology for his absence. Cllr Smith, Chairman of the Finance 
 Committee, will brief the Parish Council later on the deliberations of the 
 Committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A meeting was convened by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP in the 
 Committee Room of the Village Hall on Friday 6th January 2006 at 2pm to discuss 
 recent burst sewerage pipes and sewage odour in the village. Thames Water was 
 represented by John Gilbert and Liz Sale, Cotswold District Ward Councillors C. 
 Bennett and Mrs A. Clark, Cllr Mrs Sheila Jeffrey, a member of CDC cabinet, Rob 
 Bull (CDC Engineer), Parish Councillors M. Stuart and R. Webb and about a dozen 
 residents also attended. In all some 22 people were at the meeting. Invited by 
 the MP, Chris Orphanides outlined the history of the problems experienced by 
 residents over the years in the vicinity of Station Road, Kingfisher Place and 
 Robert Franklin Way. Mr Orphanides concentrated on the offensive odour which 
 pervaded the area and was noticeably emanating from household appliances such 
 as dishwashers, washing machines and toilets. Mr Wrightson, a resident of 
 Kingfisher Place vociferously concurred. Four bursts in the sewerage system 
 were also noted. David Spencer complained that there was no joined up response 
 to emergency problems with different agencies awaiting another’s response which 
 resulted in delayed action. Mr Orphanides complained that there had been no 
 apology from Thames Water for the sewage which had washed into residents 
 gardens during the recent bursts. Mr Gilbert apologised on behalf of Thames 
 Water for the inconvenience. Cllr Bennett complimented the quick reaction of 
 the CDC emergency team which had provided sandbagging. Cllr Stuart suggested 
 that if a new pump was required it needed to be sited away from any residential 
 area and new pipes must be large enough to cope with further planned 
 development.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Thames Water representative John Gilbert replied by 
 explaining the operation of the sewerage network and possible causes of the 
 odour. He was surprised by the emphasis placed on this problem which he 
 referred to as “subjective”. He had come prepared to explain what Thames Water 
 had planned for the future upgrading of the pipe work; nevertheless he would 
 endeavour to explain what remedies had been implemented. There was no complete 
 understanding of the cause of the malodorous stench. He explained that private 
 drains entering the system might be responsible, maybe the drains connecting 
 Kingfisher Place were not installed correctly and sewage was remaining in the 
 system and not flushed away until heavy rains occurred. Odour suppression kit 
 had been installed in the system and he was unaware that it was not proving 
 satisfactory until now. When the cause is understood the problem will be 
 addressed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Although he accepted that there had been four bursts in 
 the system pipe work within the last 18 months he decided to concentrate on the 
 three most recent ones. Samples of pipe work proved that the pipes were 20–25 
 years old and therefore scheduled for replacement around 2008–2009 through 
 on-going maintenance although it had now been decided to accelerate the 
 programme. There was no connection between the first burst 18 months ago and 
 the present outcrop. There was however a suspected connection between the most 
 recent ones. After the first of the latest bursts, when the pumps had been 
 turned off to implement the repair, the pumps were then restarted. A phenomenon 
 known as “flexing” presumably occurred. This weakened the pipes further up the 
 system which resulted in two separate bursts in Station Road outside Box Bush 
 Farm. Studies were continuing in the South Cerney catchment area and it was 
 hoped to have a solution in the ground by the end of summer 2007. In reply to a 
 question from Cllr Webb, Mr Rob Bull CDC Engineer agreed with Mr Gilbert who 
 stated that there was not a capacity problem in the South Cerney network. He 
 explained that a 9-inch feeder pipe in the system was being serviced by a 
 12-inch rising main which was totally adequate. The long awaited camera study 
 of the system which had been delayed because of insufficient rainfall would be 
 completed in the spring of 2006 regardless. This would be followed by a design 
 phase during the summer of 2006 and a design scheme for construction would be 
 in place by the end of 2006. There would then be a 9-month delivery period. Mr 
 Gilbert emphasised that funds were available to do the work in the current 
 5-year budget 2003–2008. A resident enquired how villagers might ensure that 
 Thames Water prioritise the project to which Mr Gilbert replied that the best 
 action was for residents to contact the customer help desk on a regular basis. 
 Contact could be made through 0845 9200 800 or email customer.feedback@thameswater.co.uk. 
 Mr Clifton-Brown MP requested that he be included in any email communication at

 <p class="MsoNormal">A follow up meeting was arranged to take place in the 
 South Cerney Village Hall at 2pm on Friday 29th September.</p>

 hours 25 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</p>

 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 9th January.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewerage Problems</b> <br>
 Parish Councillor Stuart, Parish Councillor Webb and the Clerk attended a 
 meeting in the Village Hall on 6th January to discuss sewerage problems with 
 Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, Thames Water representatives, CDC Ward Councillors 
 and residents. The Clerk read his report on the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mud on the highways</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire complained that vehicles using Shorncote quarry were still leaving 
 debris on the highway. The Clerk had informed the Clerk to Somerford Parish 
 Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tarmac</b> <br>
 A quote to resurface the car park at Upper Up with tarmac had been received 
 from Mark Gibbs. The Committee considered that the cost, including flood 
 prevention, made the project prohibitive.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>360 deg Swing</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had viewed vigorous use of the swing and had not noticed any 
 excessive movement in the supports.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that Steve Hanson of the Community Pay Back group will 
 carry out the work in January depending on circumstances. Cllr Harris and Cllr 
 Caunce had volunteered previously to dispose of the frame.</p>

 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Robert Franklin Way</span></font> play area<br>
 </b>Cllr Harris reported that the ‘No Dog’ signs had been installed. The safety 
 surface under the senior swing and 360 deg swing is a cause for concern through 
 soil working up through the honey combed gaps forming a hard crust in dry 
 weather. The Clerk was asked to contact GPFA for advice.</p>

 </span>Cllr Caunce reported that the surrounding wall at Manor Farm House, 
 Cerney Wick had fallen into the carriageway and asked the Clerk to report it to 
 GCC Highways. He also asked the Clerk to remind GCC Highways that no action had 
 yet been taken to cut back the overgrowing leylandii. </font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to inform Cotswold Water Park that a handrail was 
 missing on the wooden bridge on BSC22, Cerney Wick, where the path meets the 
 canal towpath and needs to be replaced. </font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 The Committee agreed to a proposal from Cllr Harris that a tree survey on 
 Parish Council land in the village be updated. Cllr Harris will ask Cllr Webb 
 to accompany him on the survey. </font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 The Committee agreed that James Harris Contracting should replace the six 
 vandalised trees, one diseased tree and plant two extra trees along the pathway 
 at Upper Up play area one of which Cllr Harris reported had been allocated. </font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

 informed the Clerk that it had been refurbished and replaced. </font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

 opposite the entrance to Meadow Way, which had a Tree Preservation Order 
 attached, had been removed. The Clerk had reported the incident to Matthew Reid 
 at CDC. </font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 The Clerk reported that he will meet with Land Registry personnel on Tuesday 
 31st January at 11am in the Village Hall.</font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PERSONNEL COMMITTEE REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to leave the room as the Parish 
 Council discussed the deliberations of the Personnel Committee which had met 
 prior to the Parish Council. On the Clerk’s return Cllr Jay, Chairman of the 
 Personnel Committee reported: “The Parish Council’s Personnel Committee is much 
 appreciative of the work carried out by the Clerk. After much consideration, in 
 particular of financial implications, it is recommended that the Parish Council 
 does not pursue entry into the GCC pension scheme on behalf of the Clerk. The 
 Personnel Committee further recommends that the Parish Council adheres to the 
 agreed policy of carrying out an annual review of the Clerk’s salary with a 
 view to an incremental increase. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
 that the Parish Council accepts the above recommendations. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk gratefully accepted the decision and thanked the 
 Parish Council for its generosity and also for its support of his activities.</p>

 Cerney (R) Notwithstanding the proposed omission of the vehicular access to 
 Cerney Wick Lane, the Parish Council still objects for the following reasons: 
 The bund on the south eastern side of the site should not be removed. It 
 provides a sound barrier to residents of Cerney Wick from traffic noise on the 
 B4696 (Spine Road). No more development should be permitted to connect to the 
 main Thames Water sewerage system until the defects revealed by the recent 
 failures of the rising main in Station Road have been identified and rectified. 
 The junction of the Spine Road, Cerney Wick Lane and Station Road should be 
 fundamentally redesigned, with a roundabout or traffic lights, to take account 
 of the inevitable traffic increase in this area. It needs to be improved and 
 upgraded in the interests of safety. The Parish Council is concerned that it 
 has been given no indication of the appearance or colours of the materials for 
 the external walls and roof tiles to be used in this development. <br>
