Prior to the Parish Council meeting Parish Councillors had a private meeting to discuss how
to manage the selection procedure for the co-option of a Parish Councillor. At the moment
there were six applicants and it was important that a selection strategy was properly
determined. It was agreed that the Clerk enquire from the Monitoring Officer at CDC
whether members of the Parish Council with a close relationship with an applicant could
vote on his/her selection or must they absent themselves through having a prejudicial
interest. Advice should also be sought on whether proxy voting by absent councillors was
admissable. It was decided to abide by Standing Order 36 which laid out the voting
procedure on appointments. All candidates were to be asked to provide a resumé of their
personal history and reasons why they wished to become a Parish Councillor in not more
than 100 words. A deadline of 31st December for responses was agreed.<br>

 12th NOVEMBER 2008</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2478 <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS.</b> Cllr Nicholas 
 suggested that a comma is inserted after the word Design on the first line. 
 Please alter accordingly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2481 <b>08/02939/FUL</b>. Cllr Nicholas pointed out 
 that Cllr Mrs Tunbridge should properly be referred to as the land owner 
 instead of a family friend. Please alter accordingly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2485 <b>Report of the Personnel Committee.</b> Cllr 
 Nicholas pointed out that although himself and the Clerk had been recorded as 
 leaving the room there was no mention of them returning. This oversight was 
 noted and the record should show their return. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Sinead Peare and Jasmin Tresadern attended the meeting on 
 behalf of the Youth Parish Council. Jasmin, as a new member, was welcomed by 
 Parish Councillors. Sinead reported that the YPC had met with members of the 
 Youth Group on Monday 8th December. Cllr Stuart replied to a query from Sinead 
 who wanted to know when the official opening of the MUGA would take place. He 
 confirmed that there were five or six schemes maturing and it would be more 
 appropriate to merge these and have one grand opening. Cllr Jay suggested that 
 the target date should be the weekend following Easter, that is 18/19 April. 
 The Clerk will contact Capt Frances Fox, Secretary of the Silver Stars 
 parachute team to see if it is available and willing to perform at the opening 
 ceremony. Cllr Harris enquired if the YPC had discussed the future use of the 
 old basketball court at Upper Up. Sinead was not aware of any discussion on 
 this matter. Cllr Stuart thanked Sinead and Jasmin for their attendance and 
 both left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PARKING PROBLEMS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from the 
 Chairman, Cllr Stuart to promote the discussion prompted by Mr Jeffery and Mr 
 Blackford over the matter of a tractor which is causing them some annoyance. Mr 
 Jeffery who lives at The Barn and Mr Blackford at Mill Cottage explained that a 
 tractor parks on the grass verge between their two properties. The said tractor 
 arrives at 6.30am and leaves at 6pm, Monday to Friday. Over time this behaviour 
 has turned the verge into a boggy, unsightly patch. Pedestrians using the 
 highway are forced to detour further onto the carriageway to pass by the 
 vehicle. Mr Jeffery and Mr Blackford consider that this adds to the already 
 dangerous road conditions which exist at this part of the village. Users of the 
 adjacent paddock, who arrive to visit their animals also park in the vicinity 
 and this compounds the problem. It was explained by the Cllr Stuart that 
 although the Parish Council was sympathetic to their plight it was not in the 
 gift of the Parish Council to resolve the problem. The PC agreed to inform 
 Gloucestershire Highways of the residents’ concerns and to enquire if there was 
 any sanction which Gloucestershire Highways could apply to obviate this 
 perceived nuisance as the tractor owner has not taken any notice of individual 
 requests to move on. Mr Jeffery and Mr Blackford then left the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CO-OPTION PROCEDURES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman, Cllr Stuart declared that the unexpected 
 number of candidates had made the situation awkward and difficult. Currently 
 there were six applicants. The Clerk read each of the candidates’ letters of 
 application and the Parish Council decided in the interests of fairness each 
 should be asked to provide a resumé of not more than 100 words giving a 
 personal history and reasons why they wanted to become a Parish Councillor. 
 That was, of course, if they wished to add to what had already been provided. 
 Some candidates had made a full and reasoned application while others just 
 indicated their availability. A decision will be made on the selection at the 
 next Parish Council meeting which is scheduled for 7th January. It would be 
 necessary to impose a deadline of 31st December for responses.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING FROM PREVIOUS MINUTES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Local Development Framework</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart noted that there had not been any progress in making a response 
 possible on the LDF by the end of December. The Clerk was asked to inform Tiina 
 Emsley (CDC) that the Parish Council had been unable to comply with her request 
 to provide a response but it would do so as soon as practically possible.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SARA Meeting <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris, Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had represented the 
 Parish Council at the recent SARA meeting held in the Village Hall on 14th 
 November. The main problem identified was speeding vehicles on the Cirencester 
 Road. The next meeting was scheduled for January 15th at 7.30pm in the Village 
 Hall, South Cerney. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Code of Conduct</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay had not received any responses from Parish Councillors. In the 
 circumstances the Parish Council agreed that Cllr Jay should make a reply to 
 the Commissioner on its behalf. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE OF PARISH CHURCHYARDS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Advice from Richard Belliss, past secretary of GAPTC 
 (Gloucestershire Association of Parish and Town Councils) on paying contractors 
 for undertaking ground maintenance of churchyards in the Parish was discussed. 
 Cllr Nicholas explained that as the contractors were not employees of the 
 Parish Council, the Parish Council was therefore not vicariously liable for 
 damage caused by the contractors in the execution of their contract. There was 
 therefore no reason why the current arrangement should change but that it 
 should continue with the Parish Council paying for the ground maintenance of 
 the churchyards. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Jay that 
 the Parish Council continues to provide for the ground maintenance of the 
 churchyards in South Cerney and Cerney Wick. The Parish Council was all in 
 favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 24th November I attended a follow up meeting of 
 the group concerned with providing youth facilities. Other youth groups, 
 including members of the Youth Parish Council, also attended. The next meeting 
 was scheduled to convene on Monday 15th December. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 2nd December I accompanied Cllr Stuart to the 
 AGM of the Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association (GPFA) in Tewkesbury. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 5th December I attended the AGM of the 
 Gloucestershire branch of the SLCC at Minchinhampton golf club. Association 
 officers were elected and a program of events for the coming year was decided. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During November of the 20 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 25 minutes per day which is slightly less than my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th DECEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart 
 and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had attended the meeting. Cllr Stuart had opened the 
 meeting at 7.05pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had made an apology for his absence at the previous Parish Council 
 meeting as he was on holiday. Cllr Stuart deputised. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2477 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards.</b> Cllr 
 Stuart had congratulated Cllr Mrs Chubb on her success in gaining a grant of 
 £2,000 from GCC. The Clerk was asked to enquire if planning permission was 
 needed to erect a shelter. Helen Donnelly Assistant Planner (CDC) advised that 
 under Schedule 2 Part 12 of The General Permitted Development Order, the Parish 
 Council can undertake the erection of a bus shelter without requiring planning 
 permission. The Committee agreed with Cllr Nicholas who suggested that 
 quotations be sought from builders as to how much a shelter built in 
 reconstituted Cotswold stone might cost. If the cost was comparable to 
 off-the-shelf shelters he was positive that residents would prefer a structure 
 more in keeping with the shelter at the Limes. Cllr Jay did not agree and would 
 prefer to have a more open structure. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2477 –<b> Mr Stansfield’s Hedge.</b> Cllr Jay 
 supported Cllr Stuart who had congratulated James Harris Contracting for his 
 work on removing the scrub growth on Mr Stansfield’s property which was 
 obscuring the view of the church from the Millennium Seat on the opposite bank 
 in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2477 – <b>Bow Wow river bank.</b> The Clerk was to 
 enquire from Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways when the exposed edges of 
 the gabion baskets are going to be made safe? Cllr Harris was concerned that 
 the coir rolls have insufficient stakes to hold them in place when the river is 
 in flood. Further, during the recent dredging of the river by the Environment 
 Agency the areas which had been seeded with grass have been despoiled and 
 although this is not the time to reseed, it will be necessary to do so in early 
 spring. Cllr Stuart stated that this area is a most cherished and picturesque 
 part of the village. Consequently anything that disrupts the natural rhythm is 
 abhorred by residents. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2477 – <b>“Shorncote Link”.</b> Cllr Stuart reported 
 that the access work is progressing and completion is expected shortly. 
 Discussions were on-going with PROW officers on the possibility of diverting 
 BSC6. Cllr Stuart will discuss with Ruth Berry if she would agree to the 
 diversion of the PROW on her land to the south side of the hedge onto the 
 playing field. Cllr Nicholas further suggested that BSC7 which crosses the 
 football field could also be diverted to our new path. Diversions could be 
 expensive but Cllr Harris stated that it might be possible to “piggy-back” on 
 other diversions to save costs. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2477 – <b>Permissive Path from Kingfisher Place to 
 Huxley Court. </b>Cllr Stuart will contact John-Charles Kimberley, Cotswold 
 Forest School, regarding this project. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2478 – <b>SARA Meeting.</b> Cllr Harris, Cllr Mrs 
 Land and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had attended the SARA meeting in the Village Hall 
 on 14th November.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris made the report on behalf of Cllr Caunce as he was on holiday. The 
 playground was all in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge made the report. It was noted that the 
 latch on the southern gate of the Toddlers Play Area was missing. Cllr Harris 
 would source another in due course. The safety surface on the 360 deg swing 
 needs cleaning out and retying. The Clerk will ask suitable contractors to 
 quote for this work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart made the report. Generally the playing fields are in good order as 
 the area is not much used due to winter conditions. Work on the football 
 pavilion renovation is proceeding. The surface of the car park is particularly 
 bad due to heavy usage.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that out of 10 requests for grass 
 cutting quotes, there had been two replies so far. This was not unusual as the 
 closure date was 31st December.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reported that BSC20 (Wildmoorway Lane) 
 was only passable with difficulty due to its muddy and flooded condition. The 
 Committee agreed that there was little that could be done as it was due to 
 weather conditions. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that there was a trip hazard, due to 
 root growth under the tarmac footpath, from Bow Wow wooden bridge to Box Bush. 
 Cllr Stuart had informed Phil Cluely from Gloucestershire PROW. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris stated that the time was right for the limbs 
 in the hedges at Upper Up playing fields to be removed. Cllr Stuart asked the 
 Parish Council if it was in order to ask James Harris Contracting to mark the 
 branches to be removed. There was no objection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that he had received an enquiry if a 
 light could be positioned near the wooden bridge in Bow Wow leading to Box 
 Bush. Cllr Jay would liaise with Mr Mould to see if a solution could be agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had declared a prejudicial interest in the 
 next item and after explaining the work required left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas stated that it was necessary to assess and 
 address the stability of the memorial trees on the Upper Up play area. Since 
 the initial planting some stakes needed to be removed and others tightened. 
 James Harris Contracting was considered by the Committee to be the best 
 contractor to carry out this work and it will recommend to the Finance 
 Committee that it agrees to contract James Harris Contracting for the sum of 
 £100 (ex VAT). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had been informed by a member 
 of the public that the pipes draining into Lake 16 had been damaged during 
 recent work. Cllr Harris stated that he had reported the situation in the first 
 instance to Adrian Davies from Watermark Fisheries and then repeated his 
 concerns to Ray Jenkins whom he asked to expedite a repair. Cllr Stuart asked 
 the Clerk to inform Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways that one of the 
 two pipes draining into Lake 16 to the left of the gateway near Kingfisher 
 Place had been compromised. The Clerk informed the Parish Council that the 
 matter was in hand. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was agreed that Finance Committee accepts the following 
 recommendations: that James Harris Contracting carries out the work to tighten 
 or remove the stakes of the memorial trees as necessary for the sum of £100 
 plus VAT; that it agrees to make a grant to the Cotswold Waterpark Society of 
 £2,500 as the Parish Council’s contribution for access improvement including 
 the purchase of a metal bridge on the Shorncote Link at Upper Up; that the 
 Finance Committee is minded to spend £4,000, which will include a grant of 
 £2,000 from Gloucestershire County Council, on the installation of a bus 
 shelter at the junction of Station Road and The Lennards. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">New items to be added to the Task List include: Cllr 
 Stuart would contact Coralie Dustin (Ramblers Association) regarding the 
 proposed realignment of PROW BSC6 &amp; BSC7 and the proposed change of status of 
 the permissive path across the Upper Up playing field. Cllr Stuart would 
 contact Phil Cluely (PROW) about the trip hazard on the tarmac path from the 
 wooden bridge in Bow Wow to Box Bush. Cllr Harris and the Clerk would continue 
 to monitor the restoration of the drainage pipes on Lake 16. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee noted the email from R. Jeffrey complaining 
 about a tractor parking on the highway verge in Cerney Wick. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart had closed the 
 meeting at 8.25pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 
 8th
 DECEMBER 2008</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.40pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Betec Joinery Ltd</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that Betec Joinery Ltd had carried out further work on the 
 noticeboard at Clarks Hay but it was still unsatisfactory. The pin board area 
 enclosed by the aluminium frame had not been replaced as requested in previous 
 correspondence. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that 
 the Parish Council makes an interim payment of £400 now with the balance on 
 satisfactory completion. The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SPREAD SHEET ANALYSIS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">With two-thirds of the period completed the expenditure 
 detailed on the spread sheet was consistent with the exception of the overspend 
 on Professional Fees. In the fullness of time these fees would be recovered. 
 Members’ allowances had also exceeded its budget slightly. The major 
 expenditure on ground maintenance was now complete for the season and was well 
 within budget at 70 per cent of target. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE PLAYING FIELDS 
 AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the first 
 item and also the payment for scrub clearance at The Downings and left the 
 room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The following recommendation had been made: that James 
 Harris Contracting carries out the work to tighten or remove the stakes of the 
 memorial trees as necessary for the sum of £100 plus VAT. <br>
 James Harris Contracting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scrub clearance at The Downings (as per quote)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £99.88 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Land that the Parish Council agrees to contract James Harris for the memorial 
 tree work and also to pay for the scrub clearance. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was further recommended by the Playing Fields and 
 Village Maintenance Committee that the Finance Committee agrees to make a grant 
 to the Cotswold Waterpark Society of £2,500 as the Parish Council’s 
 contribution for access improvement including the purchase of a metal bridge on 
 the Shorncote Link at Upper Up; that the Finance Committee is minded to spend 
 £4,000, which will include a grant of £2,000 from Gloucestershire County 
 Council, on the installation of a bus shelter at the junction of Station Road 
 and The Lennards. The Finance Committee did not object to any of these 
 recommendations but asked the Clerk to enquire if there was a time limit on the 
 £2,000 grant from GCC. The Clerk was able to confirm that there was no time 
 restriction imposed and the grant would be held available. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Land that the Parish Council makes the grant to the Cotswold Waterpark Society 
 and is minded to spend £4,000 on installing the new bus shelter. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PRECEPT MEETING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee agreed to hold a meeting to decide 
 on precept recommendations at 2pm on Friday 2nd January 2009 in the Committee 
 Room of the Village Hall. The Clerk was asked to invite Cllr Caunce Chairman of 
 the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee to the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A series of activity events had been proposed by members 
 of South Cerney Young People’s Project for the January to Easter period. Cllr 
 Jay recommended that the Parish Council considers subsidising the ice-skating 
 trip with a grant of £100; granting £100 for a lantern making project or 
 providing transport to Cirencester’s Brewery Arts Centre; granting £400 for 
 team building activities at the Forest of Dean Wilderness Centre. The appeal 
 for funds for a kayaking course at SCOEC was deferred and would be considered 
 at a later date. It was recommended that the Parish Council agrees to grant 
 £600 in total for these activities and to ring fence all donations separately 
 to the agreed projects. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the Parish Council will make the above grants. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Jay had closed the 
 meeting at 9.02pm </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Planning Committee had agreed not to meet as the three 
 applications had already been determined by email. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BY COTSWOLD DISTRICT 
 COUNCIL</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman had declared a prejudicial interest in 
 this application as she is a close neighbour of the Crown Inn, Cerney Wick and 
 did not offer an opinion at the consultation stage but left the room while the 
 Parish Council considered its decision on ratification. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>08/03169/FUL Amendment</b> <br>
 Applicant: Mr G. Palmer, Crown Inn, The Street, Cerney Wick GL7 5QH <br>
 Proposal: Demolition of three derelict buildings/garage. Erection of steel 
 garage at the Crown Inn, The Street, Cerney Wick GL7 5QH (R) <br>
 In addition to the objection submitted, the Parish Council also objects to the 
 NEW DETAILS: DETAILS OF PLANTING published on the web site on 17th November 
 2008. The proposed screening would be no substitute for the use of proper, 
 suitable materials. The Parish Council objects to this application because the 
 proposed materials are unsuitable in this conspicuous location. The site is on 
 the boundary of an attractive residential settlement, in a rural location, and 
 so it should be constructed using vernacular materials, not semi-industrial/ 
 commercial materials. <br>
 If permission is to be granted, the Parish Council asks that the following 
 conditions be imposed: <br>
 1. The garage should be constructed of materials that are appropriate to the 
 locality and the existing buildings, to protect and maintain the character and 
 appearance of the area in which this development is located. <br>
 2. The garage doors should be of vertical boarded timber, which are more 
 appropriate and in keeping with the appearance of the area. <br>
 3. The garage should only be used for garaging and/or storage purposes 
 ancillary to the private residential occupation of the Crown Inn. <br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge that the Parish Council ratifies the decision of the Planning 
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman returned to the room. </p>

 Applicant: Mr Brian Wronski, c/o Agent: LPC (Trull) Ltd, Trull, Tetbury, Glos

 Proposal: Replacement post and wire fencing along 180 metres of north east and 
 south west boundaries. Erection of five post and rail fences with gates at The 
 Lodge, Lake 75, The Street, Cerney Wick GL7 5QJ (R) <br>
 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr 
 Harris that the Parish Council ratifies the decision of the Planning Committee. 
 The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge declared a prejudicial interest in this 
 next application as she is a friend of the applicant and left the room while 
 the Parish Council considered its decision on ratification. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>08/03279/FUL</b> <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to insert the following agenda 
 item for next month’s meeting: Village Plan Update. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that at the AGM of the South Cerney 
 Trust Andrew Stumpf gave a very interesting talk on British Waterways canals. 
 Facts of interest included that only 4% of canal usage was water based 
 activity. Anglers, walkers, cyclists etc were other groups using the 
 facilities. It was a priority to open up canal paths for all users. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired from Cllr Parsons (GCC) if consent 
 was needed to back fill lakes as he had concerns about such an activity taking 
 place on Lake 16 by Watermark. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Jay asked Cllr Parsons (GCC) about 
 the future of permissive paths at Shorncote. Cllr Parsons stated that he was 
 seeking Watermark to confirm the continued existence of permissive paths and 
 has asked for a letter from the company to let their intentions be known. It 
 was his understanding that Watermark had no wish to close permissive paths.</p>
