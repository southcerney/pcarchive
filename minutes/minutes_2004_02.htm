    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 11th FEBRUARY 2004</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify">The meeting began at 7pm with Chairman Cllr Stuart welcoming Lt.Col. S. English Commanding Officer 29 Regt, Duke of Gloucester Barracks, South Cerney. Col. English informed the assembled Parish Councillors that he would complete his tour of duty at South Cerney within 9 months to a year. Regiment strength was about 318 personnel with 50 to 100 based at South Cerney and the rest on tours of duty including the Balkans and Middle East. Col. English said that the Regiment treasures its close association and interaction with the local community and hoped to organise an Open Day in either June or July this year. Col. English is also closely involved through being a Governor of Ann Edwards and the Siddington schools. In the last year the Silver Stars parachute team had raised over £120,000 for charity and an example of a local donation was £300 made to the Cirencester Access Group. Problems in the timing of replacing the current aircraft had been experienced. He explained that aircraft purchase was a seasonal activity and furthermore the bank which was to fund the purchase had been concerned with local complaints. Nevertheless he reported that he had signed the order for a replacement aircraft recently and delivery was expected before the end of March. He was strongly against promoting corporate functions in the use of camp facilities as he did not consider the base a commercial enterprise. A new activity being planned was the creation of an Olympic standard clay pigeon shooting range. Cllr Nicholas told Col. English that weekend parachuting was to blame for giving the Regiment a bad press. Col. English emphasised that weekend activity was strictly controlled with the last flight landing on a Saturday at 7pm on a Sunday at 6pm. Cllr Jay said that the participation of the Regiment in the Remembrance Sunday parade was much appreciated and regarding complaints he remarked that it was only a minority of the village population involved but it was obvious that the silent majority was in favour of the camp and its activities. Cllr Bennett (CDC) informed the meeting that Bob Austin (Chief Executive Officer at CDC) and Geoffrey Clifton Brown MP have both drawn a line under the issue of noise from minority complainants. The Chairman Cllr Stuart thanked Lt.Col. English for his visit and he left the meeting at 7.35pm.</p>

    <br>
    The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.35 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Apologies has been received from Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr 
    Parsons (GCC).<br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 14 JANUARY 2004</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Minutes 
    were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and 
    the Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Crime Reduction Officer</b><br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) explained the role of Les Haines, Crime Reduction Officer 
    (CRO) and said that his duties did not replicate those of the local 
    constabulary. He informed the meeting that the post was funded by the Home 
    Office and not the CDC. The Clerk was asked to invite the CRO to a future 
    meeting.<br>
    <b>Pedestrian Crossing</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas had checked out the specifications for the positioning of 
    pedestrian crossings and informed the meeting that a crossing could be 
    placed 5m from a junction. Cllr Nicholas volunteered to liaise with Ann 
    Edwards School to see if it had a preference in the location of a crossing. 
    The Clerk was asked to include this item in next month's agenda.<br>
    <b>Ham Lane</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that the owner of the grass verge between Sudeley 
    Drive and Ham Lane was Sapco One Ltd, 4 Broadgate, London EC2. Councillors 
    were asked to reflect on what approach should be made to Sapco One Ltd, if 
    any, regarding the installation of an access ramp on its property.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK'S REPORT</b><br>
    During January I logged 761/4 hours averaging 3 hrs 37 mins over the 21 days 
    available which is on target for the agreed contract.<br>
    On 3 February I met with Mr Hodgson (CDC), Rachael Stanway (CDC) and Cllr 
    Nicholas to discuss plans for the provision of public art and ground 
    maintenance for Jubilee Gardens.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and 
    Playing Fields Committee that had met on 9 February.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Safety Tiles at Upper Up</b><br>
    See Inspection Reports.<br>
    <b>Churchyard Wall Extension</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that work had started on the churchyard wall but the 
    contractor had found concrete reinforcing throughout the old wall which was 
    creating extra work and some of the recovered stone would not be suitable 
    for use in the new wall.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Planting</b><br>
    According to the specification from Whitton Associates a minimum of 57 trees 
    would be needed. Cllr Harris had been in contact with Cirencester Town 
    Council who recommended that each tree should cost £50 and any plaques at 
    the donator's expense. It further advised that sponsorship rather than 
    specific memorial trees be considered.<br>
    <b>Dipping Pond at Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that Ann Edwards school was quite keen to adopt the 
    pond at Upper Up as a dipping pond. The Parish Council was all in favour and 
    the Clerk was asked to inform Stephen Richardson (Head Teacher).<br>
    <b>Litter Bins</b><br>
    Cllr Squire agreed with Cllr Harris who suggested that both the dog and 
    rubbish litter bins at the entrance to Robert Franklin Way be moved to 
    inside the playing field. Cllr Jay remarked on an accumulation of rubbish at 
    the Millennium Seat in Bow Wow. He proposed that the bin be moved from near 
    Mr Mould's property to alongside the seat. The Parish Council was in favour 
    that the Clerk should ask CDC to move these bins.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Cycle Mounds</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had prepared a specification of the work needed to solve the 
    problem of water accumulating on the lower surfaces of the mounds. Cllr 
    Squire had reviewed the specification and concluded it should be sent out to 
    tender. Cllr Harris advised the Clerk to contact Whitton Associates for the 
    names of suitable contractors. The Parish Council agreed with a 
    recommendation from Cllr Squire that a grant be applied for from the 
    Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund Grant Scheme. Cllr Squire will liaise 
    with the Clerk.<br>
    <b>Noticeboards</b><br>
    An A3 poster advertising a forthcoming event had been stapled to the 
    noticeboard in Clarks Hay with over 100 staples. Cllr Harris reminded the 
    Parish Council that if the covering of the noticeboard proved successful, 
    which it had, the noticeboard at the Limes should be clad with a similar 
    self healing pinboard material. The area needed to be covered was 2280 x 
    910mm and the Clerk was asked to obtain quotations from Greenbarnes Ltd to 
    supply and suitable contractors to install it. The Clerk was to ask Mr 
    Curtis if he would clean the noticeboard opposite the Post Office in Clarks 
    Hay.<br>
    <b>Correspondence</b><br>
    Three quotations to carry out play ground annual inspections had been 
    received. The Committee recommended that John Hicks who gave the lowest 
    quote of £140 plus VAT be appointed. See Finance<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that generally the area was in good order with the 
    exception of the safety tiles and some abuse of the area from the football 
    pitch to the cycle mounds. The edging around the play equipment surfaces had 
    been cleared. Cllr Stuart and Cllr Harris reported that the safety tiles on 
    all three sites will have to be re-fixed, re-aligned and steam cleaned to 
    remove algae. The Clerk was asked to contact suitable contractors for 
    quotations.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that high winds had caused a lot of twigs to 
    strewn in the play area which she will remove.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the scalpings had been removed and due to the 
    current construction project the only piece of play equipment in use was the 
    slide. MacVenture Play Co hoped to finish the installation by 23rd February 
    and Gordon Cornelius would be erecting the Haggs Equipment this coming 
    weekend. When the alterations were complete the siting of the dog and 
    rubbish bins would be inappropriate and the Clerk was to ask CDC if it could 
    move them to the other side of the entrance at the playing field.<br>
    <br>
    <b>JUBILEE GARDENS PUBLIC OPEN SPACE</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Nicholas who was happy with the 
    principle that a commuted sum, to be decided, be accepted for the future 
    maintenance of the site. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr 
    Harris to accept the Committee's recommendation that the Parish Council 
    agrees to the proposed plan. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE PLAN</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that he had persuaded Tim Gibbs to join the sub 
    committee which will meet in the next two weeks.<br>
    <br>
    FINANCE<br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee that had met 
    on 9 February.<br>
    <b>Churchyard Extension</b><br>
    Cllr Jay informed the Parish Council that because of the use of concrete in 
    the construction of the original wall it would be more difficult and 
    consequently more expensive for the mason to complete the contract within 
    his quoted price. The extra materials and labour will probably mean that 
    extra funding will be needed.<br>
    <b>Bus Shelter Light</b><br>
    Cllr Smith had found that the light bulb in the shelter was not of a 
    standard design. It was agreed by the Parish Council that Cllr Squire should 
    source a new light bulb.<br>
    <b>Councillors Allowances</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported that after he had scrutinised the information on 
    Councillors allowances he concluded that it was for the Parish Council 
    collectively to decide whether to accept allowances and not individual 
    Councillors. He asked the Clerk to put this item on the agenda for next 
    month's Parish Council meeting. The Clerk was asked to ascertain from the 
    Monitoring Officer how Parish Councillors, under the new Code of Conduct, 
    could vote on such a motion of whether or not to accept allowances and 
    whether the decision to pay the allowances would be on an annual basis or 
    for the term of the council.<br>
    <b>Payments Received</b><br>
    RoSPA Refund £207.98<br>
    <b>Outstanding</b><br>
    Mr R. Hewer Noticeboard repair £265.00<br>

    Lee Ponting Removal of overgrowth at Upper Up play area £95.00<br>
    Busy Fingers Photocopying £42.44<br>
    W. A. Eaton Churchyard wall extension interim payment £1,470.00 £1,881.84<br>
    Cllr Jay inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for January. It 
    was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish 
    Council agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    Village Hall Topline Contract Furniture Ltd (replacement chairs) £1,747.81<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Smith Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee took over from Cllr Jay 
    when he and Cllr Stuart declared a prejudicial interest in this payment as 
    the Councillors are members of the Village Hall Committee and left the room. 
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Squire that the Parish 
    Council agrees to make the above payment.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour. Total: £3,629.65<br>
    <br>
    <b>Quotations</b><br>
    A quotation to decorate the interior of the main room of the Village Hall 
    had been received from Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart. Cllr Nicholas advised that 
    as their quotation had been received after other competing quotes, new 
    quotes for the work should be sought. Cllr Webb, Parish Council 
    representative on the Village Hall Committee, will draft a specification for 
    the decoration and in the interests of transparency would independently 
    analyse any quotations received. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the meeting 
    that another Parish Council were using members of the Community Service as 
    labour to decorate its hall although it was not yet known how professional 
    the job would turn out. Nevertheless, the Clerk will enquire when the 
    Community Service contacts him on another matter.<br>
    Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart were asked to rejoin the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Ground Maintenance Tenders</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb declared a prejudicial interest as her husband was involved 
    in the quotation process and left the room. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and 
    seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council accept the recommendations 
    of the Village Maintenance Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour 
    in contracting Andrew Gibb to maintain the road verges, Station Road ditch, 
    Bow Wow Lane, and playing fields. Cllr Mrs Chubb rejoined the meeting. It 
    was also agreed that Tim Stephens be appointed to maintain South Cerney 
    churchyard and Rodney Gardiner for Cerney Wick churchyard and playing field. 
    The Clerk was to ascertain from James Ellis, Monitoring Officer if the 
    tender analysis should be treated as confidential information.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Annual Safety Inspections</b><br>
    The Clerk had been in contact with John Hicks who had offered to carry out 
    the annual inspections and the commissioning inspection of the new equipment 
    at Robert Franklin Way for a total price of £300 plus VAT. It was proposed 
    by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council agrees 
    to John Hicks' combined offer. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee that 
    had met on 9 February.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Parking at Titcombe Motors</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that vehicles from Titcombe Motors in Clarks Hay were 
    causing an obstruction to the footway and asked that a letter be sent to 
    them asking them to refrain from this practice.<br>
    <b>CT.4067/2/M Dental Practice</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had been informed by A. Jones Head of Planning (CDC) that as no 
    comment had been received from any District Councillor regarding the sign in 
    Sudeley Drive permission had been granted although the Parish Council and 
    other residents had objected to its erection. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) will 
    enquire into the circumstances and report at the next meeting of the Parish 
    Council.<br>
    <b>Clarification of Declaring an Interest</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to obtain clarification when a Parish 
    Councillor declares a professional interest if it is also prejudicial.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/V</b><br>

    Revision to previously approved development of holiday lodges with reduced 
    number to fifty (50) and amended designs at Lake 16, Station Road, South 
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    The lodges, especially those on plots 1 to 11, on the peninsula would be 
    unnecessarily conspicuous and dominate the view from the south eastern edge 
    of the village.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0532/T</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart declared a professional interest and left the room.<br>
    Applicant: Mr &amp; Mrs R. Bradley, Ham Cottage, Station Road, South Cerney, 
    Glos.<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council agrees with the decision of the Planning Committee. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Stuart rejoined the debate.<br>
    <b>CT.1454/3/Y</b><br>
    Minor Amendment: The incorporation of a Osplit' within the previously 
    approved bund at Wildmoor Waters, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney,

    Removal of Condition 4 of planning permission reference CT.4073/D to allow 
    the clubhouse facilities to be used by the general public at Lake 15, Spine 
    Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    If granted this would set a precedent for unrestricted commercial use. It 
    would generate use by HGVs which will park on the Spine Road and/or 
    Wickwater Lane. Additional highway work will be needed to cope with the 
    expected need for parking.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.4704/C</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr &amp; Mrs N. Stilwell, The Old House, High Street, South Cerney,

    study at the Old House, High Street, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 
    5UP<br>
    The design details of this extension are alien to the local style. Redland 
    roof tiles will clash with the natural stone roof tiles on the main 
    building.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.5790/L</b><br>

    Revised design of new house at land at Orchard House, Upper Up, South 
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    The Parish Council had no objection to the design of the house but did 
    object to the removal of the remaining trees as shown on the plan. 
    Furthermore, the plan attached to this application does not show all the 
    trees now standing.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council agrees with the decisions of the Planning Committee, except 
    CT.0532/T already voted on. It was further proposed to ratify the other 
    decision made by the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
