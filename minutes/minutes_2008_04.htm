    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 9th April 2008</strong>.</p>

At 7pm Cllr Stuart welcomed Mike Harris Waste Communications Officer at Cotswold
District Council. Mike gave a 20 minute presentation on how the revised collection of
household and garden waste would be handled. When the new bins are delivered information
packs will be included which will endeavour to explain the new procedures. Unfortunately,
due to technical difficulties the roll-out has been rescheduled and it is now expected that the
full service will begin on Monday 23rd June. Garden and food waste collection will remain a
weekly event. The first batch of green bin licences had been mailed out today and collection
of garden waste would start on Monday 21st April. From that date, you can put garden waste
out weekly on your collection day either in a green garden waste wheeled bin displaying a
valid annual licence or within council issued brown paper garden waste sacks. Food waste,
in households new food waste container (if received) or mixed with garden waste in a green
garden waste wheeled bin displaying a valid licence, will also be collected from 21st April.
From 23rd June a new fortnightly collection of non-recycleable landfill waste in grey
wheeled bins or beige refuse bags will start. The collection of card and cardboard in
reuseable blue sacks will also start on 23rd June. The fortnightly kerbside recycling box
collection of paper, glass and cans will continue as normal throughout the start-up period.
Flexible collections, in exceptional circumstances will be accommodated through the
purchase of extra brown paper sacks from the District Council offices. The new grey bins
will be electronically chipped to give a minimum of information only. It will not record
weight but for audit purposes will eventually record if the bin has been emptied. It is
expected that the new scheme will reduce landfill waste by 25% if the outcome of trials in
the district is repeated. Mike Harris assured Cllr Jay and Cllr Mrs Land that elderly and
physically impaired residents will be catered for as special circumstances. The waste and
recycling service could be contacted on 01285 623 123. Cllr Stuart drew the meeting to a
conclusion by reminding those present that a waste and recycling roadshow would take place
outside the Londis in Broadway Lane on Wednesday 16th April from 1–5pm. Cllr Stuart
then thanked Mike Harris for attending the meeting and he left the room at 7.30pm.<br>

 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.35pm. He welcomed the newly elected
Ward councillor Peter Clarke and politely reminded both District Councillors that this Parish
Council was apolitical. Parish Councillors favoured his remark. <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">

 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2375 – Last word of last line: delete “rejected” 
 insert “declined” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the YPC attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas 
 explained that this was probably because this meeting coincided with the late 
 Easter school holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart remarked that he was awaiting a call from Mrs 
 Bishop (Public Protection Manager CDC) to survey those parts of the village 
 which might benefit from being included in the new Dog Control order currently 
 being debated at the District Council. The Clerk was asked to remind Mrs Bishop 
 of the arrangement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas informed the Parish Council that he had 
 received an acknowledgement of the receipt of the Parish Council’s response 
 from the collators of the survey by CWP Joint Committee of the views of key 
 stakeholders in relation to the vision, aims and objectives as outlined in the 
 plan for the future of the Water Park.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">On Thursday 27th March I joined Cllr Stuart 
 to attend the Parish and Town Councils Annual Seminar at Hartpury College near 
 Gloucester. After registration the meeting started at 6.30pm. Delegates were 
 welcomed by Pete Bungard, Chief Executive of GCC. Out of the 263 parish and 
 town councils in the county, 132 were now chartered. Of the various facts given 
 he informed us that there were still 1,000 families who had not returned to the 
 their homes since the July floods. 200 families were still housed in caravans. 
 He then introduced Eddie Coventry, Head of Emergency Management who encouraged 
 all to build resilience within their communities, primarily through self help. 
 There were simple steps which could be taken and he recommended that a template 
 plan which was available on the GCC website should be checked out. Vareta 
 Bryan, Assistant Director of Community Services followed explaining her 
 department’s involvement with care for those disadvantaged in the community. 
 There was concern about the demographic balance in the county which was 
 becoming unbalanced through the increase in elderly who would be demanding more 
 of the service in the future. Recruiting staff to handle this increase in 
 provision was already proving difficult through competition from the private 
 sector. After a short break for refreshments David Hughes, Waste Communications 
 Manager gave a highly informative presentation on recycling, its effects and 
 future targets. Penalties for non compliance would be severe and stretch the 
 ingenuity of his department to conform. Rachael Topps, Campaign and Marketing 
 Officer explained her duties in promoting the work of the county council as a 
 whole and how she intends to raise the profile of the organisation. She proudly 
 announced that the Audit Commission had recently awarded the GCC four stars for 
 management. Each session was followed by a short question and answer period. 
 After the seminar which finished at 9.30pm, Rachael told us that the Flood 
 information booklet which had been reprinted would be delivered with the Cerney 
 News, hopefully with its April edition. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">On the 3rd April I attended a meeting of the 
 Police and Community Consultative forum at Ampney Crucis Village Hall. It was 
 poorly attended with only 5 people in attendance. Mrs Vera Coulston a Police 
 Authority Member introduced Inspector Steve Williams and PCSO Gemma Butcher 
 whose beat includes the east of the county from the outskirts of Cirencester to 
 Lechlade and the associated villages. One interesting bit of information was 
 the change in the attitude of how the police now saw the community as its 
 customers. This was evident through the introduction of the Neighbourhood Panel 
 Meetings interacting with the Safer Community Teams. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">During March of the 19 available working days 
 I averaged 3 hours 55 minutes per day which is approximately 20 minutes more 
 per day than my contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Cllr Nicholas enquired if the Clerk was 
 content with the extra time taken to perform his duties. The Clerk confirmed 
 that it was acceptable.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th APRIL</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Walker had emailed an apology for his absence to the Parish Council 
 Chairman, Cllr Stuart. He was experiencing difficulty in a domestic matter.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> <br>
 After a short consultation Cllr Caunce agreed that, if elected, he was prepared 
 to continue as Committee Chairman. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded 
 by Cllr Harris that Cllr Caunce be elected Chairman of the Committee. The 
 Committee was all in favour. Cllr Caunce thanked the members for their support.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reflective Strips on Bollards</b> <br>
 The Clerk has asked Cllr Mrs Land to investigate if the temporary reflectors on 
 the bollards have been replaced with reflector plates. Cllr Mrs Land reported 
 that the temporary reflectors remained attached. The Clerk will inform CDC and 
 GCC Highways.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>View from Millennium Seat, Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas will report any progress, if any, to the Parish Council at its 
 next meeting what advances had been made in persuading the house owner to 
 reduce the height the young trees and leylandii which was obscuring the view of 
 the church from the seat. The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr 
 Nicholas that the Parish Council write to Mr Stansfield and ask him to either 
 remove or prune the trees.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CCTV Inspection</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that the survey of the drain from Upper 
 Up to Station Road had been completed although GCC Highways had not yet 
 received the report.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path</b> <br>
 A date for a meeting with Mr Westell of Aggregate Industries on the 
 installation of a suitable barrier has yet to be arranged.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bore Hole Lease</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that he was still in negotiations with the Environment 
 Agency regarding an increase of rent based on the conditions of the original 
 lease.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Links on Senior Swings</b> <br>
 R.O.W. Berry had replaced the D-bolts securing the chain to the overhead post. 
 Mr Berry had also tightened the chain on the south side of the swing.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park Refurbishment</b> <br>
 Thames Water had agreed that it would reinstate the surface of the car park as 
 part of its refurbishment of the sewage system.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dog Bins</b> <br>
 R.O.W. Berry had installed the three bins as ordered. The Clerk had informed 
 Mike Harris, CDC of their sites.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that all was in order, the gate to the playing fields from 
 the car park had been reversed and two new “D” shackles had been fitted to the 
 senior swing. The new hedge planting looked good.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that all was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that all was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tree Work</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a potential 
 contractor and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Four quotations to carry out pruning of trees and shrubs 
 in the village had been received. The Committee recommended that the Finance 
 Committee agrees that Tim Bryant is awarded the contract as he had given the 
 most competitive quotation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MUGA Installation</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart read a report on his efforts to install the 
 MUGA. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following many months of frustrating negotiations with 
 Thames Water over the ground works required for the proposed MUGA it now seems 
 that we will have to accept that the situation will not be resolved within the 
 parameters set by the Big Lottery Grant Fund as it relates to the youth shelter 
 which must be finished by the end of June or early July. Cllr Stuart recommends 
 that the Committee considers employing Hartell Contractors to carry out the 
 site works and the laying of the tarmacadam.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The quotation from Hartell is in two sections: one 
 for the full 40 x 15 metres and an alternative, though smaller 20 x 15 metres. 
 Furthermore the quotation allows a mix and match to include full site works and 
 tarmac or for tarmac only. This will be useful if Thames Water eventually do 
 the site works it has promised free of charge. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The quotation is as follows: Tarmac to comprise 50mm base 
 coat below 25mm wearing coat. <br>
 40 x 15 metres full site works and tarmac <br>
 20 x 15 metres full site works and tarmac or tarmac only on a prepared site. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Another quotation for consideration is from Grimshaw Group 
 for tarmac only on a prepared site. This company is recommended by GPFA as it 
 is a specialist in sports surfaces. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Park Leisure Ltd had also quoted to supply and install a 
 youth shelter and a further quotation to supply and install a 3:2:1 goal 
 end/kick wall. These quotations may well increase due to the length of time 
 since they were given.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">£5,000 has been awarded from the Big Lottery Fund towards 
 part of the project leaving the balance to be financed by the Parish Council. 
 An application to the Land Fill Tax fund is in progress but events may overtake 
 its award due to complying with the conditions attached to the Big Lottery 
 Fund. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">All prices quoted do not include VAT. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart proposed that the Committee recommends to the 
 Finance Committee its commitment to this expenditure and to empower him to 
 authorise contractors to proceed. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded 
 by Cllr Harris that the Committee recommends this procedure to the Finance 
 Committee. The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart agreed to liaise with Stuart Milsom, our agent 
 at MAI, to see if Thames Water can be persuaded to conform to its obligations. 
 The Clerk will contact the references given by Hartell for their opinions and 
 report to Cllr Stuart as soon as possible. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Litter Picking/Bus Shelter Cleaning</b> <br>
 A request had been received from Mr E. Curtis that the Parish Council considers 
 increasing his payment for cleaning the bus shelter by £10 per month. The Clerk 
 confirmed that it had been 7 years since the agreement was determined. It was 
 proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Finance 
 Committee should consider increasing his payment to £50 per month for cleaning 
 the bus shelter. The litter picking payment would remain as agreed. The 
 Committee was in full agreement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas enquired if Parish Councillors would support 
 a community compost facility in the village. No Parish Councillor was minded to 
 object. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the ivy cutting episode from 
 trees along the old railway line had ceased. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had an enquiry from the owners of Century 
 House if the sloped ground to the front of this property could be included in 
 the grass cutting program. The Clerk was asked to enquire from the contractors 
 how much it would cost if the area was to be included in the existing schedule 
 at the same frequency. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the footpath from outside Brook 
 Cottage, Silver Street northwards on the eastern side of the carriageway merits 
 improvement. The surface has degenerated into a muddy track. It is a missing 
 link from the tarmacadam surface further north. The Clerk was asked to contact 
 GCC Highways and ask Gillian Portlock to consider upgrading this pathway so 
 that residents can enjoy the benefit of a properly surfaced footpath within the 
 confines of the village. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that Amanda Keys GCC PROW had been 
 in contact with him regarding the Modification Order 2002. The application for 
 the Barracks footpath was progressing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb enquired if the parking notices outside of 
 Bridge House had received permission. Cllr Harris stated that the owner had 
 informed him that according to his deeds the area in question belonged to him. 
 Cllr Harris agreed to ask Mr Genillard if he would let the Parish Council have 
 sight of the document. Cllr Harris reported that Mr Genillard would forward a 
 copy of the deeds to the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.18pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th 
 APRIL</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported that minor inconsistencies in the application for a 
 grant from the Resilience fund had been resolved and a revised application had 
 been submitted for approval. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay noted that the final spread sheet which showed that the total 
 expenditure on Administration was 99.84% of budget was an outstanding 
 achievement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Parish Council agrees with the recommendation from the Playing Fields and 
 Village Maintenance Committee to increase the payment to Mr Curtis by £10 per 
 month. The Parish Council was all in favour. The Committee had agreed with Cllr 
 Jay who stated that a review should be made annually based in line with 
 inflation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr Webb 
 that the Parish Council agrees with the recommendation from the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance Committee to appoint Tim Bryant to carry out the tree 
 and shrub clearance work as specified. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land 
 that the Parish Council agrees with the recommendation from the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance Committee to empower Cllr Stuart to authorise 
 contractors involved in the installation of the MUGA to proceed. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</p>

     The Finance Committee was concerned with how much the premium quoted by 
     Came &amp; Company might increase in subsequent years if it was agreed to 
     commit to a three year period. The Clerk was asked to enquire from Came &amp; 
     Company if a figure could be determined on any increase. Came &amp; Company 
     stated that the premium would be adjusted by index-linking of the property 
     sums insured. Cllr Nicholas asked that the Upper Up Humps and Bumps be 
     specifically included in the schedule. It was proposed by Cllr Walker and 
     seconded by Cllr Mrs Land that the Parish Council accepts the quotation and 
     commits to a three year contract. The Parish Council was all in favour.

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart informed Cllr Mrs Tunbridge that there was a 
 solution to remove painted graffiti and advised her to contact Mary Mychaleckyj 
 from Young Gloucestershire for further information.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that there large holes in the 
 surface of Cerney Wick Lane, at the old entrance to Lake 11. Cllr Caunce would 
 inform Gillian Portlock. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb had attended a meeting of the Cotswold Water 
 Park Society. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a lot of discarded material had 
 accumulated in the vicinity of the newly planted hedge and asked if it should 
 be removed. Various suggestions from Parish Councillors included burning it to 
 an organised work party to dispose of it. Eventually it was agreed that a 
 contractor should be hired and the Clerk will seek quotations which will be 
 forwarded to Cllr Caunce for consideration. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked if a decision had been reached by CDC on 
 the applications by street traders to sell ice cream in the village. Cllr 
 Clarke (CDC) informed him that the licences had been approved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger (CDC) informed the Parish Council that the 
 sign denoting the line of the old canal had been erected on the Cirencester 
 Road near the Lock House. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that her property had been 
 vandalised and reported the incident to the police who responded quite quickly. 
 A window pane on the roadside had been broken and a wooden gate taken off its 
 hinges. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported two other acts of vandalism to public 
 rights of way signs. One at the wooden bridge in Bow Wow where the finger post 
 information board had been sawn off and the other near the entrance to the 
 Lennards/Box Bush areas which had been turned around to show the path in the 
 opposite direction. It was beyond his capabilities to reverse the sign and the 
 Clerk will inform Phil Cluley at PROW at GCC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay proudly exhibited his new bus pass but complained 
 to both District Councillors that, once again, South Cerney had been excluded 
 from any mention in the accompanying literature. This was indefensible as South 
 Cerney was a much larger community than others given prominence. He urged the 
 Ward Councillors to put South Cerney on the map. Cllr Clarke (CDC) noted his 
 annoyance and would seek an explanation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Clarke (CDC) informed that he had been appointed to 
 the Licencing Committee at CDC but his appointment had been after the decision 
 to grant recent street trading permissions. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had attended the annual Parish and Town 
 Councils Seminar at Hartpury College near Gloucester on 27th March. On 2nd 
 April he attended the recurring six weekly meeting of the Safer Cotswold South 
 Crime and Disorder Partnership. He informed the Parish Council that Fosseway 
 Housing had been renamed Fosseway Living. Emily Whitehead and Mary Mychaleckyj 
 from Young Gloucestershire had informed him that young people were now meeting 
 at Ann Edwards School every Tuesday evening and 15 attended a recent event. 
 Cllr Stuart proudly informed Parish Councillors that the Village Hall Committee 
 had achieved a Hallmark Scheme accreditation and was the first in 
 Gloucestershire to pass. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart said that he would be attending the 
 institution and induction ceremony of Revd David Bowers on Sunday 27th April on 
 behalf of the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Items for publication included the Hallmark Scheme 
 accreditation award and the new refuse and recycling collection project. </p>

 closed the meeting at 9:07pm.</p>
