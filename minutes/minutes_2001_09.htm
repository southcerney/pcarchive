    <br>
    The Chairman Cllr Mrs Gardiner opened the meeting at 7.30pm and called for a minute¹s
    silence in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    There was an apology from Cllr Jones (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>ELECTION OF VICE CHAIRMAN</strong><br>
    Cllr Bride had tendered his resignation by letter. Councillors spoke of their profound
    shock and would miss his help. Cllr Stuart suggested that he be asked to reconsider. Cllr
    Nicholas offered to Chair the Planning Committee if that would lessen his work burden.
    Cllr Spriggs said that Cllr Bride would have considered his decision long and hard. No
    extra pressure for him to return should be applied. The Parish Council should thank him
    for his valuable service to the Council and the community over the many years he had been
    a Parish Councillor. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    <br>
    In the absence of any other nominations, Cllr Stuart agreed to stand for the post of Vice
    Chairman. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish
    Council appoint Cllr Stuart as Vice Chairman. The Parish Council was in agreement.<br>
    <br>
    The Clerk had informed the Cotswold District Council of a Casual Vacancy. Notices would be
    displayed publicising this Casual Vacancy.<br>

    Stuart reported that rubble and debris had been removed near to the lamp post no 4 in
    River Way.<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Minutes as amended
    were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council agreed unanimously and the Minutes
    were signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Village Floods</strong><br>
    As Cllr Mrs Gardiner will be unable to attend the forthcoming meeting on 28 September with
    the agencies involved in monitoring the progress being made on flood control Cllr Harris
    volunteered to go in her place.<br>
    <br>
    Mr &amp; Mrs Chapman spoke of their concern with recent actions by Fosseway Housing
    Association in the Berkeley Close area. Cllr Stuart declared an interest and took no
    further part in the discussion. The Chapmans were suspicious that Fosseway was planning to
    develop an area of land to the south of Ann Edwards School but were unable to find out
    anything from Fosseway. It was agreed by the Parish Council that a letter be sent to
    Fosseway asking them what their strategy and/or intentions were for the field behind and
    south of Ann Edwards School between the Shire Ditch and Berkeley Close.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Disabled Access</strong><br>
    An application for grant aid had been made by the Parish Council to Cotswold District
    Council. The application will be considered by Committee on 17 September and if agreed
    will be presented to a panel on 27 September for ratification.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Market Towns Initiative</strong><br>
    Due to annual holiday commitments at CDC the Clerk had been unable to recruit a CDC
    representative but he would try to arrange for a representative to attend the October
    Parish Council meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 10
    September.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Best Value Review</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to provide him with the relevant correspondence regarding
    the Best Value Review. Cllr Nicholas also highlighted contentious conclusions in the
    Review. In a poll carried out by MORI for the CDC it was found that those questioned in
    the survey were satisfied with the length of time taken to process planning applications.
    Of five outcomes to a Focus group questionnaire two were patently ignored. The responses
    from the Parish Councils had a universal theme. The majority of their comments were
    directed at a greater involvement by the parishes in the planning process which wanted
    more time to consider applications, more time to consider amendments and more
    opportunities to express their views at Site Inspection Briefings and committees. Cllr
    Nicholas asked that the time restrictions imposed by the Review be placed on the Planning
    Committee¹s agenda for October. CDC also commissioned MORI to survey 2000 residents in
    the District about a range of services including ³planning². The Review referred to
    three outcomes, one of which was ³. . . that people were (strongly supportive of the
    Council¹s commitment to offering pre-application advice) satisfied with the length of
    time it took to process the application². Cllr Mrs Clark informed that problems created
    by lack of staff in the Planning Office had now been addressed.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Committee Vacancy</strong><br>
    The Parish Council agreed not to replace Cllr Bride on the Planning Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/N<br>
    Porch extension to existing lodge at Lodge 62, Spring Lake 2011 (Lakes 4 &amp; 5),
    Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.2249/D<br>
    Demolition of existing bungalow and garage and erection of new house and garage at
    Fairholm, Silver Street, South Cerney Cllr Mrs Spriggs and Cllr Stuart declared an
    interest and took no further part in the discussion. A letter objecting to the application
    had been received from Mr &amp; Mrs P. Spriggs. The Committee agreed that the proposed
    application was out of keeping with adjoining properties. There would be a loss of amenity
    of light and the proposed dwelling would overlook neighbouring dwellings. The position of
    the proposed garage in front of the building line is inappropriate. It was proposed by
    Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Parish Council objects to this
    application. The Parish Council was in agreement.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.3115/B<br>
    Minor amendment re erection of three detached houses and garages and formation of
    vehicular access on land to the rear of 3 Meadow Way, South Cerney Cllr Mrs Gardiner and
    Cllr Gardiner declared an interest and took no further part in the discussion. The
    original application was the subject of an appeal which was allowed. The Committee agreed
    that the proposed amendment would incur a loss of privacy to neighbouring properties to
    the south. The Parish Council objected to application CT.6271/A for an adjoining site
    which had subsequently been withdrawn. It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr
    Mrs Chapman that the Parish Council do not object to this application. The Parish Council
    was in agreement.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.3239<br>
    Erection of a new garage at Orchard House, Cerney Wick, Cirencester The proposed
    application could not be considered as just a garage as it is for a 2 storey building. The
    building is inappropriate as it is too close to existing boundary.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4125/1/F<br>
    Erection of single storey extension to existing dwelling at 10 Beverstone Close, South
    Cerney. Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Cllr Gardiner declared an interest and took no further part
    in the discussion. It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the
    Parish Council do not object to this application. The Parish Council was in agreement.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4233/F<br>
    Excavation to form pools; resulting spoil to form mounding and open-sided gazebo The
    Parish Council declared an interest as applicant. Cllr Harris informed the Parish Council
    that Martin Portus would apply for a deferment because of Environment Agency objections.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8163/A<br>
    Installation of dormer windows at the Old Stable Block, Orchard House, Upper Up, South
    Cerney, Glos. The Parish Council disagreed with the applicant¹s assertion that the
    alterations would not require a change of use permission.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8173<br>
    Erection of a 10 metre mobile Otelegraph¹ telecommunication column supporting an omni
    antenna and an equipment cabin positioned adjacent not exceeding 2.5 cubic metres at
    junction of Station Road/east Spine Road South Cerney The Committee had agreed not to
    object to this application. Due to the time restraint applied by Cotswold District Council
    in making a response it was not possible to involve the Parish Council in this decision.
    Cllr Harris informed the Parish Council that the structure would occupy the middle of the
    planned cycle path on the Spine Road. The Committee were unaware of this when it took its
    decision and Cllr Dunn commented that because of the time restrictions imposed this vital
    information was unavailable.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    On the applications not already voted on Cllr Mrs Gardiner proposed and Cllr Stuart
    seconded that the Parish Council agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning
    Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning permission granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/H<br>

    development shall not start before details of on-site and off-site foul and surface water
    drainage arrangements have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. 10.
    The wording of this Condition is incorrect, uncertain and ambiguous and the Clerk was
    asked to point this out to the Planning Authority. 11. The holiday units shall not be
    occupied from the 6th day of January until the 5th day of February inclusive each year.
    12. The Covenants referred to as Conditions 12 and 13 above are incorrect. It should read

    Cllr Mrs Gardiner inspected and agreed the Clerk¹s travel expenses for August.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council agrees
    to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>District Audit</strong><br>
    The District Auditor commented that the Balance Sheet should be signed by both the
    Chairperson and Clerk. A list of asset values was required. He requested that copies be
    forwarded to him. He suggested that in future the donation made to the British Legion be
    made from the Chairperson¹s allowance and not under Section 137. It was necessary that
    the Fidelity Guarantee be recorded in the Minutes. Cllr Nicholas asked that the District
    Auditor explain in writing why he advised that under Asset Values the Village Hall and the
    Upper Up playing field be valued at £1 and why they were not included in the Balance
    Sheet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Budget Analysis</strong><br>
    Professional fees had exceeded budget through the inclusion of the RoSPA inspection fee.
    It was agreed not to include this fee in the Playing Fields Maintenance as it would now be
    budgeted as a professional fee in future. Village Hall Running Costs exceeded budget but
    was offset by a donation of £2475 from the Village Hall funds. Ear-marked reserves should
    be added as per budget. The words OReserve Fund¹ should be added to the Village Hall Roof
    and Road Safety Improvements titles.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Quotes</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris declared an interest and took no further part in the discussion. Three
    quotations had been received to raise the crowns of the lime trees in Silver Street. It
    was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council accept
    the quote for £65 which was made by Cotswold Water Park Society. The Parish Council was
    in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 10 September.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Cornhill Insurance</strong><br>
    The Clerk had written to the Lewis and Mathieson families from Robert Franklin Way
    regarding the implications of the Parish Council¹s insurance policy. The families had
    asked permission from the Parish Council to form a working party.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>GCC Highways</strong><br>
    1. The public footpath between High Street and Meadow Way had been resurfaced.<br>
    2. Permission had been given to Glos County Highways to proceed with a CCTV survey of the
    culvert in High Street<br>
    3. The overgrowing hedge at Orchard House in Upper Up has been cut back.<br>
    4. Two way springs had been added to the gate at the end of the bridge in Bow Wow near
    Upper Mill but needed some adjustment.<br>
    5. The Clerk had reminded Mr Taylor of Glos County Highways that the piping of the drain
    between Oklahoma and the Long House in Cerney Wick was still outstanding.<br>
    6. The low willow branch opposite the footbridge in the Bow Wow had been removed.<br>
    Cllr Harris thanked Cllr Stuart for liaising with Mr Taylor.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lighting</strong><br>
    The Clerk had informed Barry Greenaway, Road Lighting Manager, on the decision taken in
    August by the Parish Council regarding the upgrade to the lights in South Cerney. Cllr
    Stuart reported that tree growth around the street light outside Pontings opposite the
    entrance to the Langet requires cutting back by the owners. Tree growth around the lamp
    positioned towards Upper Up playing field needed cutting back. Mr Taylor was aware.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lines on Basketball area at Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris awaited confirmation from Ermin Toolhire on the supply of suitable equipment
    to paint the lines.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Steps on disused railway line</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Mr Mould had carried out repairs to the steps. Further
    improvements await grant aid. Cllr Mrs Spriggs said that as this was only a permissive
    pathway the Parish Council should consider applying for it to be added to the definitive
    map. The Parish Council agreed and the Clerk was asked to obtain the relevant application
    forms from Amanda Keys at GCC.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Berry Farm Crossroads</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that overgrowth at the crossroads was restricting the view towards
    Ashton Keynes and also at the junction of Broadway Lane and the Spine Road.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Harris had carried out the inspections for the previous month. At Upper Up play area
    there was an accumulation of rubbish although the bins were not too full. A broken section
    of the play bark surround at Robert Franklin Way play area needed replacement. The play
    bark needed replenishment. At Cerney Wick hawthorn hedge trimmings had been left to blow
    off the hedge top. The Clerk was asked to write to Helen Dorling, South Cerney Riding
    School in Cerney Wick with a copy to Simon Taffinder, owner of the field, to cut back the
    hedge to ground level and clear away the cuttings in order that the fence can be repaired.
    Cllr Mrs Chubb will carry out the inspections in the coming month.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Gardiner volunteered to get the play bark. Cllr Harris would pick up a replacement
    board for the play bark surround on his next visit to a sawmill.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Stuart will contact Mr E. Curtis to see if he was willing to pick up rubbish at both
    playing fields and generally throughout the village.<br>
    <br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform Jeremy Simmons Landscapes when he carries out his last cut
    to only strim the sides of the ditch in Station Road as plans were in hand to dig out the
    ditch. Mr Timbrell had been asked to quote to dig out the ditch.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported that moles were becoming a problem on the Upper Up playing fields.
    It was recommended that the Clerk contact Able Pest Control Services and ask them to quote
    for their removal.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Nicholas had met with Brian Leeke from Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association who
    was particularly concerned with the arrangement of the wooden frame around the rubber mats
    at the swings on Robert Franklin Way play area which he considered dangerous. His report
    contained some useful tips in dealing with suppliers, grant agencies, useful contact
    names, telephone numbers and other advice. Cllr Harris proposed that a Sub Committee be
    formed to progress the re-equipping of the playing field. Cllr Nicholas said that this Sub
    Committee should include local residents. It was agreed to try and attract interested
    parties through the Cerney News and Cllr Nicholas offered that his telephone number could
    be used as Parish Council contact.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MILLENNIUM PARK</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris summarised the objections raised by the Environment Agency: to development
    within 6 metres of a river bank ­ this could be easily overcome; to the siting of the
    spoil heap on the flood plain created by digging out the pond ­ this was more difficult
    as alternative sites would be a compromise and possibly impracticable. It was frustrating
    news and a deferment of the application would be asked for. Martin Portus will liaise with
    the Environment Agency to try and assuage their objections. A site meeting will be
    arranged with the Environment Agency, Martin Portus and Cllr Harris.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>BLEDISLOE CUP</strong><br>
    South Cerney has been named winners of the Bledisloe Cup for the Best Kept Village in
    Gloucestershire, Large Village category. Cllr Gardiner will collect the sign from Lower
    Slaughter on Saturday 15 September and after some discussion the Parish Council agreed to
    site it at the junction of Station Road, High Street and Clarks Hay near to the 2-sided
    seat. Cllr Stuart will attend the presentation which will take place at 2pm on Saturday 22
    September. As winners, South Cerney have been invited to enter a competition for Village
    of the Year. Cllr Stuart said that we owe it to the community to enter especially as South
    Cerney had such up-to-date IT facilities. He would liaise with the organiser Graham
    Stockham in preparing the entry.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CAR PARK AT UPPER UP</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart suggested that the enlargement of the car park at Upper Up playing fields be
    considered. He asked that the Car Park enlargement be added to next month¹s agenda. The
    Clerk was to ascertain from Mike Napper if planning permission would be required.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CRICKET CLUB LICENCE</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Licence now be signed by
    Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner and Vice Chairman Cllr Stuart. The Parish Council was all in
    favour.<br>
