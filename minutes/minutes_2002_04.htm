    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr King that the Minutes as amended,
    were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes were
    signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    Shorncote Sewage Pumping Station Visit The Clerk was asked to arrange, with Thames Water,
    for Parish Councillors to visit the pumping station at Shorncote on Thursday 13 June at
    7.30pm or 8pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Web Site</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that Raymond Fenton had amended the design of the web site and it
    was now ready for launch. Cllr Nicholas would inform Mr Fenton and create an item for
    Cerney News publishing the address <a href="http://www.southcerney.org.uk">www.southcerney.org.uk</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>LOCAL TRANSPORT NEEDS</strong><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner read a letter from Dr Stephenson regarding local transport needs. Cllr
    Stuart&nbsp; invited Dr Stephenson to join a sub-committee and he agreed. Cllr Stuart
    would invite the involvement of local people to join a steering group including the PTA,
    South Cerney Residents Association, the Play School, South Cerney Trust and others. Cllr
    Mrs Spriggs expressed concern that the findings of the sub-committee be respected and that
    it should not be ignored by the Parish Council like those of the Village Appraisal. She
    asked for reassurance that the same thing would not happen to this sub-committee. Cllr
    Stuart confirmed that he would use his best endeavours to make sure that as long at this
    Parish Council exists a similar situation would not develop. The Parish Council was all in
    favour of creating a sub-committee and Dr Stephenson left the meeting at 7.55pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 8
    April.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Appeal by Westbury Homes</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas had made a further enquiry of Hunter Page Planning (HPP) whether the Parish
    Council could make a statement independently of CDC and Westbury Homes at the forthcoming
    Appeal and as a result HPP had arranged for the Inspector to issue a formal invitation to
    the Parish Council to attend. This invitation had now been received. The Parish Council
    agreed that the fear factor regarding the implications of this application was paramount
    and the Inspector should be made aware of those concerns. The Parish Council agreed to
    focus on points already detailed in its letter to the Inspector with special mention of
    drainage, traffic and additional asset facilities which may be made available to benefit
    the village as Conditions if permission is granted. The Inspector requires Proof of
    Evidence by 30 April and Cllr Nicholas will try to combine both opinions in a draft
    document to be circulated to all Parish Councillors for their approval. Cllr Nicholas
    volunteered to present this document at the enquiry and expected to be cross-examined on
    it. Cllr Gardiner proposed and Cllr King seconded a motion that Cllr Nicholas should
    represent the Parish Council at the Appeal. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

        definition he was surely an external auditor. Nevertheless the Clerk would enquire from Mr
        R. Fenton and Mr T. Slator if either was prepared to act as an independent

    Due to the absence of the Committee Chairman Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart reported on the
    deliberations of the Playing fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 8
    April.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>CCTV Survey</strong><br>
    If no action has been notified before end of April the Clerk is to ask Mr Mooney for a
    progress report.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village of the Year Prizes</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the Village Hall Committee was in the process of purchasing the
    armed chairs.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Gardiner and Cllr Stuart had met with Mr B. Greenaway GCC Street
    Lighting to inspect street illumination in South Cerney. Cllr Stuart reported that Mr
    Greenaway was embarrassed that so little of the work which he had ordered had been
    completed. He recommended that a new light be installed nearer the footbridge in Bow Wow.
    He proposed to erect a post with an extended arm at Bridge House in Silver Street and
    install an extra light in Clarks Hay between the Post Office and Meadow Way. Extended arms
    to two lamps in Station Road were being redesigned and accepted that the new light outside
    the Scout Hut in Berkeley Close was still not working. Mr Greenaway would liaise with D.
    Taylor of GCC Highways to lop overgrowing tress obscuring lamps in Upper Up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Stile on BSC17</strong><br>
    The Clerk had contacted the PROW office at GCC and was informed by Mrs A. Keys that Mr
    Phil Cluely had inspected the stile and would shortly be in contact with the landowner to
    offer him his advice on how to proceed.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Golden Jubilee</strong><br>
    Cllr Dunn, Cllr Stuart, Mrs A. Stuart and Ian Cheeseman had met with Mrs Rowena Merson and
    arrangements were progressing for the gala to be held at Atkyns Manor.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cycle Racks</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had confirmed that the racks were currently being fabricated.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported on his inspections. There were cracks in the swing seats at Cerney
    Wick and Upper Up but were not considered dangerous at the moment. Repairs had been
    carried out to the post and rail fence at Cerney Wick by a work party organised by Ian
    Fairbrother. Due to the seasonal improvement in the weather the algae which was covering
    the safety tiles was disappearing. Pressure cleaning was not considered necessary but
    future inspections must ensure that the tiles do not become a trip hazard. Cllr Stuart
    will carry out the inspections in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>WICKSTEED SAFETY REPORT</strong><br>
    Wicksteed Leisure recommended that information signs be erected at all play areas denoting
    ownership and location of an emergency service contact point. The Clerk had ascertained
    that the signs were advisory only. Entrapment points on the tower slide at Upper Up and
    the slide at Cerney Wick were considered a hazard. Cllr Gardiner, Cllr Harris and Cllr
    Stuart had inspected the tower slide and found a problem area where small fingers could
    get caught. Further discussion will take place to decide whether to seal or widen the
    offending gap.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>WORK ON THE PIECE</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to produce a notice to inform affected residents that tree work on the
    Piece was to be rescheduled to the end of the summer season to protect nesting birds.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK REPORT</strong><br>
    The outcome of a water vole survey which was currently in progress had delayed the
    submission of the plans to CDC. Tender replies were awaited.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS<br>
    </strong>The Clerk had reported a missing sign for the Lennards at its junction with
    Station Road. Dangerous potholes in Station Road were continually being reported to Parish
    Councillors and the Clerk was asked to inform D. Taylor at GCC Highways. Mrs Chubb
    reported that although piecemeal repairs had been made to the carriageway other holes were
    constantly appearing. Cllr Mrs Pearse asked that the Clerk enquire from GCC Highways as to
    their future plans regarding Station Road. The Committee asked the Clerk to contact Jeremy
    Simmons regarding the lack of grass cutting at Upper Up and Robert Franklin Way play area.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>QUALITY COUNCILS</strong><br>
    The Clerk attended a conference at the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester University on 16 March
    to formulate a strategy on training for Clerks and Parish Councillors. It was the
    intention of central government to encourage all members of Town and Parish Councils to
    attend training classes which would improve their understanding of their responsibilities
    as public representatives.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CODE OF CONDUCT</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner read a letter from Poulton Parish Council detailing its opposition to
    the new Code of Conduct. All eleven Parish Councillors had completed the Register of
    Members' Interests and with the exception of Cllr Dunn and Cllr Harris who were not at the
    meeting signed a Undertaking to Observe Members' Code of Conduct. The Clerk would now hold
    copies of the Register in a locked cupboard in the Village Hall and an identity record
    kept of anyone asking to inspect it. The originals would be forwarded to the Monitoring
    Officer at Cotswold District Council in accordance with the regulations. A motion was then
    proposed by Cllr Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council adopt the
    Code of Conduct. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PARISH COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Spriggs volunteered to remain as Parish Council representative on the Village
    Hall Committee. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pearse that
    Cllr Mrs Spriggs be nominated as Parish Council representative on the Village Hall
    Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
