    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 14th JANUARY 2004</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify">The meeting began at 7.05pm with Chairman Cllr Stuart 
    welcoming PC George Lager Rural Beat Officer. The Constable explained the 
    new shift patterns being introduced to comply with a European Directive. 
    Shifts would be increased from four to five to allow personnel 11 hours rest 
    between shifts. To supplement manpower Police and Community Safety Officers 
    (PCSOs) would be introduced to the service on a annual salary of £19k and it 
    was expected that two would be assigned to Cirencester. Wardens was another 
    option being considered but these would be funded through the District 
    Council. Cllr Bennett (CDC) assured the meeting that the Cirencester area 
    was one of the safest in the country and by inference one could say Europe. 
    Cllr Nicholas asked what could the Parish Council do to improve conditions. 
    PC Lager was in favour of youth shelters and referred to the success of such 
    a scheme in Lechlade. Cllr Stuart said that such a project would benefit 
    South Cerney as 20% of the population was under 21 years of age. PC Lager 
    informed the meeting that grant funding was available and will pass on 
    details of the funding providers to the Clerk. Concern was raised with the 
    new appointment of a Crime Reduction Officer at CDC as the role was being 
    duplicated with the service being provided by Gloucestershire Constabulary. 
    PC Lager explained that both positions would work in concert for the benefit 
    of the community at large. The Chairman Cllr Stuart thanked PC Lager for his 
    visit and the Constable left the meeting at 7.30pm.</p>

    <td>The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.35 pm by 
    wishing all assembled a happy and prosperous new year and thanking Cllr 
    Squire for deputising at last month's meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    An apology had been received from Cllr Harris who had been unavoidably 
    delayed.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLLR PARSONS UPDATE RE KINGFISHER PLACE ADOPTION</b><br>
    Both Redcliffe Homes and Watermark had agreed to sign the Easement agreement 
    to allow Gloucestershire County Council to proceed with the road adoption. 
    Plans were now needed for attachment to the document and Tom O'Connor from 
    Redcliffe Homes confirmed that he would forward them to GCC.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 10 DECEMBER 2003</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the 
    Minutes were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour and the Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Ham Lane</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that Ham Lane had no registered title but Sudeley 
    Drive and the verge thereof did have registered title. RoSPA Refund<br>
    The Clerk informed the meeting that no refund had yet been received from 
    RoSPA. It was expected that RoSPA would reimburse the fees paid by the 
    Parish Council for last year's inspections £177 plus VAT (£207.98).<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK'S REPORT</b><br>
    On Monday 15 December I attended a regional conference with Cllr Smith at 
    Bristol on Quality Councils. The main speaker was Alun Michael, Minster for 
    Rural Affairs, Defra. Government is keen that Parish and Town Councils take 
    responsibility for more of the services presently managed by District 
    Councils and County Councils. He was eager that Parishes should join 
    together to form clusters to achieve economy of scale. He was signalling the 
    start of a new era of two tier local government based on Unitary Authorities 
    and Town and Parish Councils. The next speaker was the Chief Executive of 
    North Wiltshire District Council who explained that District Council's 
    partnership with towns and parishes in its area concentrating on the 
    redevelopment of Calne and praising what had been achieved. Overall, I did 
    not see how South Cerney could benefit from Quality status except by joining 
    a cluster of nearby towns and parishes if and when the District Council has 
    been abolished but that is for Parish Councillors to decide. I am quite 
    happy with the present arrangement of working 18 hours a week on a part time 
    basis and have no intention of becoming a full time Clerk. At the moment 
    South Cerney Parish Council abides by most of the criteria necessary to 
    achieve Quality status. The two glaring exceptions in my view are that I do 
    not have an AQA qualification and the Parish does not publish its own 
    newsletter. Quality status is not compulsory. The afternoon session was 
    devoted to a morale boosting exercise for Clerks and its representative body 
    the SLCC, punctuated with a lecture on pitfalls affecting Clerks by its 
    Legal Adviser. I asked the Executive Officer from the floor if he could 
    justify the 33% increase in subscriptions. His answer and that of a cohort 
    was less than satisfactory in that the increase was really quite a small 
    amount £18 and very good value for money. If given a chance to reply I would 
    have pointed out that the presentation given previously by the Chief 
    Executive was totally based on percentages and pi charts to illustrate his 
    points.<br>
    On 30 December I contacted CAPS, regarding the non-payment from R. Hewer, to 
    be informed that his employers had been asked for payment on 17 December. 
    The two outstanding payments have now been received.<br>
    During December I logged 791/2 hours which averaged just over 21 hours per 
    week based on the 19 working days available. The extra time I worked is due 
    to the conference I attended and over the period I took 2 days holiday. On 2 
    January I met with Cllrs Jay, Nicholas, Smith, Squire, Stuart and Webb at 
    8pm in the New House to discuss precept proposals for the year 2004-05. 
    After two hours the members of the Finance Committee agreed the 
    recommendations which will be put to the Parish Council meeting on 14 
    January for approval.<br>
    On Friday 9 January I forwarded pictures of the unsatisfactory finish to the 
    Impact Scheme to Jennifer Watkins, Senior Supervisor Glos County Highways. 
    On Friday 9 January I enquired from CDC Enforcement Officer if Planning 
    Conditions were being breached by Titcombe Motors in Clarks Hay through 
    having cars displayed for sale on its forecourt. I was subsequently informed 
    that they were in breach and the business told to apply for planning 
    permission.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Harris joined the meeting at 8pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and 
    Playing Fields Committee that had met on 12 January.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Safety Tiles at Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had met with Steve Griffiths of Macventure Play Co and explained 
    the work needed to refurbish the safety tiled area at Upper Up. Steve 
    Griffiths had promised to reassess the problem and the Clerk was to enquire 
    from Mr Griffiths if he had made any progress.<br>
    <b>Churchyard Wall Extension</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had agreed to become Project Leader and would liaise with the 
    contractor to ensure that the work was carried out as per the 
    specifications. Cllr Squire agreed to a request from Cllr Jay to view the 
    recent archaeological report on the graveyard.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Planting</b><br>
    Due to illness the Committee had not yet met to discuss a planting plan for 
    Upper Up. It was agreed that when planting was complete a definitive map 
    would be produced showing the position where donated trees had been planted. 
    An individual map would also be presented to each person making a donation.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Cycle Mounds</b><br>
    Both Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart had independently inspected the problem of 
    water accumulating on the lower surfaces of the mounds. Both were in 
    agreement that a French drain with a perforated pipe of approximately 150 
    metres would be needed to relieve the flooding and wet area between the 
    heaps to make the site more user friendly in wet weather. Cllr Harris, Cllr 
    Squire and Cllr Stuart agreed to make a further inspection in the afternoon 
    of Saturday 17 January after which specifications for the work needed would 
    be drawn up and three quotations sought.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart in his report stated that the cycle mounds were virtually 
    unusable due to the excessive water actually flowing through the area and 
    that a drainage scheme was needed. Contractors have yet to reconstruct the 
    fence by the new footpath. The overgrowth around the safety tiles has not 
    been cut back and the gaps in the tiles remain.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
    Mrs Chapman report stated that the fence had been repaired. The play area 
    was in good order.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that a heap of tarmac scalpings had been left on the 
    play area by Mr Mould's work gang. Cllr Squire will ask Mr Mould to arrange 
    from its removal.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Ground Maintenance Tender</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to send the revised tender specification for ground 
    maintenance to potential contractors.<br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee that had met 
    on 12 January.<br>
    Cllr Jay thanked Cllr Nicholas for his hospitality when the Finance 
    Committee met at his house on Friday 2 January to discuss the precept.<br>
    <b>Payments Received</b><br>
    South Cerney Football Club Share of water bill £7.95<br>
    South Cerney Cricket Club Share of water bill £5.30<br>
    CAPS R. Hewer £80.00 £93.25<br>
    <b>Outstanding</b><br>
    Mr R. Hewer Noticeboard repair £265.00<br>
    <b>Payments Out</b><br>
    Macventure Play Co Robert Franklin Way 30% deposit payment £7,078.50<br>
    Petty Cash Bus Shelter Cleansing (January) £40.00<br>
    Petty Cash Litter Picking (January) £100.00<br>
    M. McKee Clerk's Travel (December) inc Training £126.21<br>
    SLCC Membership Renewal £72.00<br>
    Glos County Council Archaeological evaluation at All Hallows £1,192.63<br>
    Thames Water Water Services 15 September to 14 December £13.25<br>
    Southern Electric Bus shelters in South Cerney &amp; Cerney Wick £10.79<br>
    Busy Fingers Photocopying £45.48 £8,678.86<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    South Cerney Village Hall Village Hall refurbishment (S. Dyer)<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Jay, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb declared a prejudicial 
    interest in this payment as the Councillors are members of the Village Hall 
    Committee. £348.97 £9,027.83<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish 
    Council agrees to make the payment to the Village Hall account. The Parish 
    Council, with the exception of those Councillors who had declared an 
    interest, was in favour.<br>
    Cllr Jay inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for December.<br>
    <b>Precept Recommendations</b><br>
    Cllr Jay explained the proposed precept drawing attention to two new 
    headings. On Members Allowances he emphasised that no Councillor should be 
    penalised by attending Parish Council activities. Many Parish Councillors 
    were disinclined to claim allowances but this should not prevent others from 
    claiming. Under the heading Capital Replacement he highlighted the new 
    section Heritage Buildings and Monument Fund which had been suggested by 
    Cllr Squire. This fund was created as a long term project to provide capital 
    for the upkeep of the many buildings and monuments in the village. Cllr 
    Nicholas added that such a fund would make the Parish Council proactive 
    instead of reactive in their treatment of such cases. Cllr Squire will 
    encourage local companies to contribute to the fund. It was proposed by Cllr 
    Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the Parish Council agrees to a 
    precept of £51,065 for 2004-05. The Parish Council was all in favour. This 
    represents £38.50 per annum for a Band 'D' Household which is an increase of 
    47p per calendar month on the previous year.<br>
    <b>Quotations</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest and abstained from voting. It 
    was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Smith that the Parish 
    Council accepts the quote from R. O. W. Berry for £55, which was the lower 
    of the two received, to remove the two concrete posts in Silver Street. The 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Correspondence</b><br>
    CAPS had forwarded overdue payments on behalf of R. Hewer.<br>
    SLCC had written to justify its increase in subscriptions. Alex Lawrie 
    Factors had accepted the Parish Council's offer of £500 in full and final 
    settlement and the Clerk was to ask them to provide a VAT invoice. A copy of 
    Members Allowances, as suggested by CDC, had been given to each Parish 
    Councillor.<br>
    <b>Churchyard Wall Extension</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had agreed to become Project Leader and would liaise with the 
    contractor to ensure that the work was carried out as per the 
    specifications. The Parish Council consented that it was in order for Cllr 
    Squire to agree to stage payments with the contractor if the work carried 
    out was satisfactory.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee that 
    had met on 12 January.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/R</b><br>
    Removal of Condition 16 on CT.0006/3/L to allow the use of colour coated 
    steel as the roofing material on the clubhouse at Lake 16, Spine Road, South 
    Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. Colour change would be to goosewing grey profile 
    sheeting.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/S</b><br>
    Variation of Condition 20 of Permission CT.0006/2/X for erection of boundary 
    fence at The Limes, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5RF Since Westbury 
    Homes have failed to obtain planning permission for residential 
    re-development of the adjoining industrial site, it is now doubly important 
    that Condition 20 be enforced. The wall was an integral part of the design 
    of The Limes housing development, and is still required to enhance visual 
    amenity. Moreover, the existing temporary wooden fence is not strong enough 
    as a safety barrier, bearing in mind the vehicles which use the adjoining 
    industrial site. Also, a wall will afford a much more effective noise 
    barrier, shielding the new houses better than a fence.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/T</b><br>
    Erection of 3 garage/storage buildings and 1.8m high mesh fencing to create 
    secure compound at Lake 16, Spine Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1599/D</b><br>
    Erection of a single garage at Morning Dew, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5QJ<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2475/1/R</b><br>
    Variation of condition 10 (details of contamination scheme) of planning 
    permission CT.2475/1/L for land at Evergreen Industrial Estate, Broadway 
    Lane, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2648/2/Z</b><br>
    Amended plans for 50 holiday lodges, cable tow water ski course with 
    clubhouse, boating lake and boathouse, restaurant and shop with office over 
    at Lake 11, Spine Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    The lake and surrounding area is not sustainable as a competition course. 
    The course is incompatible with residential use of the site. The area 
    allowed for car parking is inadequate for a competition site so adjacent 
    roads would inevitably be used for overflow parking. If permission granted 
    Conditions thereof should include: a contribution to the proposed cycle 
    track/footpath along adjacent Spine Road; make pedestrian access to Cerney 
    Wick safer by creating a footpath along southern end of lake; new access 
    from site to disused railway line; upgrade existing bridleway on disused 
    railway line from Lake 75 to South Cerney to provide a sustainable means of 
    transport e.g. cycle track and/or footpath.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.3424/E</b><br>
    Erection of orangery/conservatory, detached garage with loft over; canopy 
    over front door; and part new front boundary wall at Lower Churn, Bow Wow, 
    South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>

    Cirencester, Glos. GL7 6JA<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.7318/D</b><br>
    Minor amendment: Increased height from ground level to eaves of 
    approximately 50cm (no change in the overall height of the building). 
    Insertion of a door at first floor level on the north-west elevation at Mill 
    Cottage, Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos. GL7 5QJ (R)<br>
    The Committee had submitted an objection to this amendment. After discussion 
    the Parish Council reversed this decision and the Clerk was asked to inform 
    CDC Planning accordingly<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.8163/G</b><br>
    Retention of metal gates at Orchard House, Upper Up, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos. (R)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.8163/H</b><br>
    Retention of stone wall at Orchard House, Upper Up, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    The existing stone wall is in breach of express conditions. Currently it is 
    too high and should be reduced to the original permitted height of 2 metres 
    from the pavement. The wall defines an important boundary of the 
    Conservation Area and, in this very prominent location, it is an excessively 
    imposing feature at this entrance to the village. Furthermore the wall is 
    very conspicuous from the adjoining public playing fields and car park.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>03/03294/NEI</b><br>
    Use of Lake 62 as a Personal Watercraft Members Club by North Wiltshire 
    District Council<br>
    The proposed use of this lake would result in a very intrusive noise level 
    which would be unacceptable and detrimental to the large areas of 
    residential properties in the nearby village of South Cerney. The resultant 
    noise from the operation of this club's activity would be exacerbated by the 
    prevailing south west wind. The jet ski activities on Lake 11 have 
    demonstrated just how intrusive is this disturbing noise to village 
    residents.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish 
    Council agrees with the decisions of the Planning Committee, except 
    CT.7318/D which objection will be removed. It was further proposed to ratify 
    the other decisions made by the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour.<br>
    <br>

    Construction of 50 holiday lodges with access road and car parking (revised 
    scheme) at Lake 16, Spine Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. The 
    proposal requires the submission of additional information to demonstrate 
    that the nature conservation importance of this part of the Cotswold Water 
    Park will be maintained and that an adverse impact on the landscape will be 
    avoided. The detail submitted to date is insufficient to address these 
    issues. Accordingly, the proposal is in conflict with Policies 2, 18 and 8.1 
    of the Cotswold District Local Plan, Policy NHE8 of the Gloucestershire 
    Structure Plan Second Review and guidance in PPG7 and PPG9.<br>

    <b>CALOR VILLAGE OF THE YEAR COMPETITION</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Stuart was keen that the Parish Council agrees to enter the Calor 
    Village of the Year competition. Taking part would encourage the development 
    of the village Action Plan. The Clerk had passed sample action plans to Cllr 
    Stuart received from Laura Oakley (GRCC) which he found helpful except that 
    it might have been better if the questions had been supplied. Cllr Squire 
    scanned the plans and said that the samples provided gave a basis for the 
    production of a plan for South Cerney. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr 
    Stuart when he recommended that a sub committee be formed to further the 
    plan details. Cllr Jay, Cllr Smith, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart agreed to 
    join the sub committee. Cllr Stuart was very enthusiastic and impressed with 
    youth shelters erected in Lechlade which were proving popular with young 
    people and recommended that similar structures be considered for South 
    Cerney. He informed the Parish Council that there was a specialised company 
    which would prepare a plan for their design, siting and construction. Cllr 
    Stuart will report again at next month's meeting and asked all Parish 
    Councillors with access to a web site to check out www.villageoftheyear.org<br>

    <br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that over the previous three years there were 
    8 complaints about occupancy of second homes in 2001, 11 in 2002 and 9 in 
    2003. They were all dealt with by the Enforcement Officer at CDC. Cllr 
    Stuart asked the Clerk to inform CDC to write to local letting agents to 
    remind them of the Planning Conditions governing the letting of second 
    homes.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Jay asked how the Parish Council would react to changing the name of 
    Station Road. Parish Councillors were not in favour and no one seconded the 
    idea.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Stuart declared a prejudicial interest as his wife had served at the 
    Duke of Gloucester barracks for the last 25 years. He relayed a request from 
    Lt. Col. S. English to attend a meeting of Parish Councillors prior to its 
    next meeting. There was no vote but Parish Councillors signalled their 
    positive agreement to this request and the Clerk would invite Lt. Col. 
    English to attend the meeting scheduled for 11 February.<br>
    <br>
    The Gloucestershire Ambulance Service (NHS) had written to Cllr Stuart 
    requesting that they promote the responder scheme to the Parish Council. 
    Parish Councillors were all in favour and the Clerk was asked to invite them 
    to the April meeting.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 9.55pm. </td>
