    <p><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
    <p>There were no matters arising.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CHAIRMAN OF THE PARISH COUNCIL - REPORT</b><br>
    <br>
    We started the year with a new council following the elections and I am 
    really pleased to be able to report on how well the new team has jelled and 
    is working so well together and with our new crop of District Council 
    members. Thanks to all concerned. </p>
    <p>Thanks must also go to our top class Parish Council Clerk Maurice McKee. 
    It is not an easy job keeping us on the right track and preventing us 
    contravening too many of the myriad rules and petty regulations we are beset 
    with. Thanks Maurice my friend for all you efforts; long may they continue.</p>
    <p>The Chinese name their years after various animals. If we had a similar 
    system here in Cerney, I suggest we could rightly name this past year as 
    being the Year of The Drains. Not only drains but the stuff that flows 
    through them. We have had more than our share of problems with sewerage, 
    storm water and a very close call on severe flooding which was only avoided 
    by prompt and somewhat dramatic action by this Parish Council. </p>
    <p>July 2007 saw awful flooding throughout the country and we were so 
    fortunate to avoid the disasters experienced by so many in Gloucestershire 
    and the Thames Valley. The experience made us very aware of what could 
    happen so when more flooding occurred this January we were alert to the 
    potential for worse problems. Robert Franklin Way was within a couple of 
    inches of being inundated and sand bags were not sufficient to stop the 
    risk. On the Wednesday morning James Harris reported the situation and 
    between us we worked out a plan on how to relieve the backed up water behind 
    the bridge at the play ground. A hastily convened extraordinary Parish 
    Council meeting was held that evening and work started on Friday morning at 
    9am with James doing most of the technical stuff ably assisted by Steve 
    Walker and Tony Squire with me taking photos and attempting to prevent 
    interested villagers getting drowned in the mud! By 3.30 pm we had laid six 
    large diameter pipes across the bridle path and were able to let the water 
    flow through them. The backed up flood started to drop and we could see a 
    definite reduction in the water level within a few minutes. I dread to think 
    what would have happened if we had not done that job. A tremendous thank you 
    to everyone involved, especially James. </p>
    <p>Again on drains, I am relieved to be able to report that Thames Water has 
    at long last replaced the rising main from the pumping station at Robert 
    Franklin Way to the sewage farm at Shorncote. It has taken this community 
    too many years to get them to do the job which they still have to fully 
    complete. It has cost them over £5m but we no longer have the risk of 
    further pipeline breakages with the resulting disgusting flooding with raw 
    effluent as we have experienced for far too long. </p>
    <p>To be a parish councillor you need to have lots of patience. And I mean 
    lots of it. Nearly eight years ago we as a council paid to have a section of 
    the culvert running from Upper Up to Station Road inspected with CCTV 
    cameras as we were worried about obstructions that could cause flooding. 
    Problems were found and we were promised that GCC would do the rest of the 
    inspection and carry out what ever works were found necessary. They kept 
    their word and the work is being done this week. </p>
    <p>Away from drains another situation we were dissatisfied with for many 
    years was the fact that this village’s young people did not get their fair 
    share of the GCC Youth Services budget. Peter Jay in particular has been 
    pushing for some input from county for well over fifteen years and at last 
    we have success. For several months GCC Youth Services Mary Mychaleckyj ably 
    assisted by Emily Whitehead of Young Gloucestershire has been working with 
    an ever expanding group of youngsters in this village. This council have 
    helped by funding them with a grant to pay for some of the expenses and 
    intend to be supportive to their efforts in the future. </p>
    <p>We have continued to improve the environment with schemes such as the 
    planting of a new hedge at the Upper Up field to provide habitat for many 
    types of wildlife. Extra memorial trees have been planted and those that 
    have been in for three or four years are maturing nicely as is the pond. If 
    you haven’t visited that area please do so. It is something we are proud of 
    achieving. </p>
    <p>In 2005 we prepared a Village Plan and we have been working to carry out 
    as many of those projects as we can. In fact, we are well on the way to 
    completing the wish list and we will need to consider doing another Village 
    Plan in the next couple of years so start thinking as to what we can do to 
    further improve this great village. </p>
    <p>I do not have enough time to tell you everything we have achieved this 
    past year but when you consider that we have done so much and still been 
    able to reduce the precept by the equivalent of £1.81p per annum on a Band D 
    dwelling I suggest you are getting pretty good value for your money from 
    this YOUR parish council.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE HALL REPORT BY MR M. STUART, CHAIRMAN OF THE VILLAGE HALL 
    COMMITTEE </b> </p>
    <p>Once again we have had a very busy and successful year here in the 
    Village Hall. Bookings have continued to roll in and we have very few blank 
    spaces in the diary. </p>
    <p>Thanks to John Veitch for his efforts in promoting the Hall and also for 
    keeping it clean. Many users and other visitors have complimented us on how 
    well the place is looked after. The increase in bookings has resulted in our 
    being one of the few village halls to be able to report a profit over the 
    previous twelve months and that is despite our not having increased our 
    letting charges for several years. Yes, we are supported very well by annual 
    grants from the Parish Council but we do make a profit, albeit small, even 
    after taking those monies into account. Thanks to Parish Council for the way 
    in which we all work together. </p>
    <p>Because of the sound financial situation we were able to invest in the 
    excellent Vision and Audio system we have here now. It has been installed 
    since the end of last year and is such an improvement to the facilities. If 
    you have not seen it working stay on after the meeting and we will show the 
    remaining minutes of the football match that is on TV as we speak. </p>
    <p>The Cerney Cinema continues to thrive and we have had some top class 
    films recently and these have attracted quite large audiences resulting in 
    our making some good money for the coffers. We are grateful to CDC for 
    continuing to run the rural cinema scheme which provides us with the films. 
    Long may this continue. </p>
    <p>Of course, to have a hall run as well as this one does means we have to 
    have a top class committee and that we certainly do have. There are 17 
    members and we always have good attendance at meetings. Thanks to all for 
    the excellent input. </p>
    <p>Finally, I am delighted to welcome some people who have been such good 
    friends and supporters of this Hall for many years. GRCC does so much for 
    rural communities in this county and we rely on them for advice on many and 
    varied subjects. Tonight we have here the GRCC Village Hall Advisor Barbara 
    Pond and the Chief Executive of the GRCC, Lesley Archer. They are here for a 
    specific reason and I will now invite them to tell us why they are here. </p>
    <p>Barbara Pond explained to the audience that Village Halls could achieve 
    recognition for the standards they provide. The Hallmark Quality Standard 
    Scheme came in three levels and South Cerney had accomplished Level One of 
    the scheme. She congratulated the Committee as it was the first in the 
    county to win the award. Lesley Archer then presented the certificate to 
    Michael Stuart, Chairman of the Committee and encouraged him to go for Level 
    Two which she had no doubt was within the capability of the group.</p>
    <p>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT BY SERGEANT STEWART McINTYRE, GLOUCESTERSHIRE CONSTABULARY</b></p>
    <p>Sgt McIntyre explained to the meeting that he had only been in post since 
    Monday, which was three days ago. He reported that he had cancelled other 
    arrangements to attend this meeting. He introduced the new PCSO Daniel 
    Sinclair who was replacing PCSO Lesley Pooley. He apologised for the recent 
    misunderstandings and breakdown in communications which was mostly 
    attributed to the absence of Insp Steve Williams who recently suffered a 
    serious injury. The relief Acting Inspector Russ Cooper has been covering 
    the area since 17th April and during the intervening time has been trying to 
    get up to speed with issues across the INA. Details of the Annual Parish 
    Meeting have only recently come to his attention. </p>
    <p>In responding to some of your concerns on behalf of Acting Inspector 
    Cooper, I would like to provide some explanation. There have been a number 
    of decisions which were made prior to the beginning of his period of 
    covering. Due to the short notice which he had been given as a result of 
    Steve’s injury, there were appointments and invitations which he was not 
    aware of. I am sure that you will understand that staffing decisions are 
    made for many reasons, but I can assure you that any moves take into careful 
    consideration the impact on policing in any particular area. Whereas 
    continuity is desirable, especially in terms of community policing, the 
    valuable resources which we have, need to be placed with care, to ensure 
    they can have the greatest impact. </p>
    <p>It is clear that PCSO Pooley has done an excellent job in the South 
    Cerney area, and has developed some valuable relationships. I have no doubt 
    that PCSO’s Mike Owen and (and soon to arrive) Daniel Sinclair will quickly 
    gain the trust and confidence of the people of South Cerney, and will 
    achieve similar successes. </p>
    <p>Although it is short notice, PS Stewart McIntyre, who is the new South 
    Cotswold INA Safer Communities Team Sergeant, had agreed to attend this 
    evening’s meeting. A/Insp Cooper apologises for not being able to make the 
    meeting himself, but other duties to which he was committed before he was 
    made aware of this meeting. </p>
    <p>Finally, in respect of the Easter Weekend incident, it is his 
    understanding that incorrect information was provided to the local press. 
    This crime remains under investigation. It is unfortunate that this 
    incorrect information has caused understandable consternation with local 
    residents, and this is just one of the reasons that he shall be speaking 
    with the Divisional Commander to try and ensure that we have our own vacant 
    Divisional Press Officer post filled as soon as possible. </p>
    <p>I hope that I have managed to allay some of your concerns, and that we 
    have an opportunity to meet in the near future. </p>
    <p>Sgt McIntyre continued his report stating that crime levels in South 
    Cerney remained much as before although he highlighted where one reported 
    crime this year was 100% more than nil reported last year.</p>
    <p>Cllr Stuart stated that the presence of PCSO Lesley Pooley and her 
    interaction within the community was a contributing factor in the 
    maintenance of the low level of crime in the area. Cllr Jay said that it was 
    a refreshing change of policy to have uniformed officers on patrol. Sgt 
    McIntyre agreed. Cllr Bennett (CDC) was very impressed with the enthusiasm 
    of the new PCSO, Daniel Sinclair whom he had encountered whilst visiting a 
    nearby village. PCSO Sinclair invited residents to accompany him whilst on 
    patrol in the neighbourhood.</p>
    <p><b>.REPORT FROM MAJOR TOM FRASER, QUARTERMASTER 29th PC &amp; MC</b> </p>
    <p>A new commander has been appointed to the base. She, yes a lady, Lt.Col 
    Bethan Targett apologised for her absence as she was presently engaged 
    looking after soldiers careers in Glasgow. </p>
    <p>Major Fraser, who lives in the village, proposed an open invitation, by 
    arrangement of course, for residents to visit the base. Major Fraser 
    informed the meeting that he would be retiring soon from the Army and will 
    settle in South Cerney. </p>
    <p>The base has been extremely busy and this will continue for the next 
    couple of weeks, our support of overseas operations remains high. </p>
    <p>50 Squadron has recently deployed 55 personnel to Iraq and Afghanistan 
    for a six month operational tour. 81 Squadron is preparing to deploy to Iraq 
    and Afghanistan in September. The Regimental Head Quarters will be focusing 
    on support to Afghanistan with a large C2 deployment expected in April 2009. 
    Another Squadron with approximately 60 personnel of all ranks has recently 
    relocated to South Cerney from Abingdon. Other personnel are conducting 
    support to forces deploying to the Balkans with completion by the end of 
    May. </p>
    <p>Shortly you will read in the press, who were on the Station on Monday 
    about the ongoing troop deployment to Kosovo. This type of deployment is 
    short notice and extremely important to the MoD and it illustrates a 
    continued interest in the Balkan region. There may be an increase in troop 
    and vehicle movement in the local area, however most of the activity remains 
    on station. There will be the occasional outflow to RAF Lyneham and RAF 
    Brize Norton. </p>
    <p>The purpose of the station is to ensure that continued support is 
    provided for troop movements on a world wide scale. Most, if not all 
    personnel stationed abroad, will be processed at South Cerney prior to 
    departing from RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham. Focus on generating 
    personnel and training for the Regimental deployment in April 2009 should 
    have no adverse affect on the local area. Again all training will be carried 
    out on station or at MoD training areas. </p>
    <p>Provision has been made to increase soldiers accommodation by 144 beds. 
    These facilities will include all rooms ensuite, internet access and Sky TV. </p>
    <p>On average 6,000 troops transit South Cerney every month. Part of the 
    expansion includes a new vehicle workshop, new washdown facilities using 
    recyclable water and a new cookhouse will be completed next month. </p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM JOE LODGE, CHAIRPERSON OF SOUTH CERNEY YOUTH COUNCIL</b> </p>
    <p>Joe reported on the aims and objectives of the Youth Parish Council. </p>
    <p>For those people unaware of what the Youth Parish Council is or only have 
    a vague memory of me being here last year we are an acting shadow committee 
    to the senior parish council, with responsibilities to represent the views 
    of the youth of South Cerney. We have control of our own budget and have in 
    the past organised events mainly based around sport. </p>
    <p>Since the last year we have adapted in our roles as a Youth Parish 
    Council as some of the original members of the council have chosen to stand 
    down. These are the former Chair Person and my sister Rebecca Lodge as she 
    is now at university; Dominic Brown and Rachel King have left the council to 
    focus on school studies. We organised our Annual General Meeting of Youth 
    which was intended to be a very informal meeting where non members could 
    vote on certain matters and express their desires or opinions which they 
    felt appropriate for the Youth Parish Council to act on. The members of the 
    youth who did attend were very proactive and supportive of the youth council 
    and its work; however a major issue was attendance meant that the biscuits 
    only had to be shared between the Youth Parish Council and two others! Even 
    though there was a lack of attendance a vote still took place to decide who 
    should become Chairperson of the Youth Council and out of the four who put 
    themselves forward I was elected as the Chairperson. Since then Alasdair 
    Kennedy has joined the council to boost our numbers. </p>
    <p>No new events were held last year as the Youth Council has been working 
    on longer term projects and to make the young people in the village more 
    aware of the existence of the Youth Council here for them South Cerney. </p>
    <p>One of the major projects the Youth Council has been involved in closely 
    with the Senior Parish Council was to apply for and receive a grant for a 
    MUGA (multi use games area) to be built at the Upper Up playing fields. Now 
    we are looking to install the new facility which would give a alternative 
    way of playing games and the ability to adapt one end into a skate park if 
    in the future it is the case there is a need for one, and the area could be 
    used to station the CDC’s mobile Skate Park to gauge how used one would be. 
    There would also be a youth shelter built onto the side so people can meet.</p>
    <p>Another area of interest for the Youth Council has been the work of a 
    Gloucestershire youth service’s Mary Mychaleckyj who has been working with 
    some members of the youth of the village and has found that the youth of the 
    village requires a Youth Club which is something the Youth Parish Council 
    has always advocated, since the closure of the voluntarily run Klub Scy. We 
    will therefore be meeting with Mary in the near future to discuss funding 
    for running this, for which Saint James’ Place have already offered support 
    in the funding of a Youth worker. Also the former youth work team from All 
    Hallows church who hold the balance of the Klub Scy account have offered to 
    use this towards funding of equipment. </p>
    <p>In the long term the Youth Council would love to build a Youth Hall where 
    it will be a place for us to meet and spend time, do activities and clubs 
    can be held and equipment stored. </p>
    <p>There is currently work going on by the Youth Council to organise and 
    present the work we have done for a Hear By Right Award which is organised 
    by The National Youth Agency and is an accredited ASDAN award, so for those 
    of us who have been part of the council for an extended period of time we 
    should receive an award that equates to a low level GCSE qualification. </p>
    <p>As shown by the attendance and the AGMY a major area for the Youth 
    Council to focus on is letting our peers know we are here so they can give 
    us their opinions and allow them the opportunity to get involved with the 
    council and to see our progress, so we are in the process of designing 
    identity cards and a questionnaire as well as having set up a group on a 
    major social networking site and the idea of buying a camcorder and a laptop 
    to produce a web cast to introduce the council and to record meetings on 
    tape and to create a specialised website for the council with forums of 
    debate and the video clips previously described. Another way of raising 
    awareness of the council is to attend assemblies of local schools and give a 
    presentation. </p>
    <p>Currently the council only has six members and it states in the code we 
    devised for the council that the size should be 11 members and often the 
    work on the council can be a bit large for the number of members on it. So 
    if there is anyone who is 12–18 who you feel may be appropriate to join or 
    has an opinion on what they would like to see in the village then please 
    come and see me at the end.</p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR C. BENNETT (CDC) </b> </p>
    <p>Cllr Bennett congratulated the other two Ward members present for their 
    stalwart contribution in matters concerning South Cerney. </p>
    <p>Cllr Bennett continued: I was again given a Cabinet post with the title 
    Safe and Strong Communities. It sounds very grand but is really a catch all 
    for anything. It cuts across several departments in the council and involves 
    working with many outside agencies. </p>
    <p>Following the terrible flooding last July I had flooding tucked into my 
    portfolio. That has meant chairing flood forums when many agencies have been 
    quizzed by local Parish Councils; I also serve on the Strategic Flood 
    Recovery Group which is a county wide organisation; and I am also a member 
    of the CDC panel which is giving grants to Parish Councils for resilience 
    work. We have £200,000 to give away and there is a limit of £10,000 for each 
    applicant. The first five parishes considered received a total of about 
    £40,000. The second batch of applications has now been received and I expect 
    that more than £40,000 will be given to those parishes. If you feel you have 
    a need for money to help with flood resilience schemes then I would urge the 
    council to complete the application forms. I have also been involved with 
    consultants who are drawing up what is hoped to be a blue print for flood 
    resilience work throughout the whole district. This has all taken a lot 
    longer than I had hoped when I took on the responsibility last autumn, but I 
    would rather the job be done properly, even if it takes a little longer, 
    than just hand out money to do patchwork repairs. </p>
    <p>A major part of my portfolio deals with crime and I am pleased to say 
    that the Cotswolds is still one of the safest places to live in the world 
    and it is getting better. The latest figures show that crime has fallen in 
    the Cotswolds by 7.5% over the last four years. So it’s the perception of 
    crime that is the problem. And that is something the council Community 
    Service team spend a lot of time on. That work seems to be paying results 
    because a survey shows that 96% of people feel safe when walking in the area 
    during daylight hours. That compares to a county average of 93% and in 
    Gloucester that falls to 89.3% and in Cheltenham it’s 92.5%. </p>
    <p>The figures become even more dramatic with 60.6% of people feeling safe 
    in the Cotswolds compared to a county average of 51% and 44% in Cheltenham 
    and 37.5% in Gloucester. </p>
    <p>The team uses mobile CCTV in trouble spots and another one is to be 
    bought. The fixed cameras in Cirencester picked up more than 450 incidents 
    in the year leading to more than 65 arrests. We set up two Community Safe 
    weeks when we dealt with more than 400 inquires on community safety and 
    anti-social behaviour. Six Community Days are planned for the district this 
    summer. </p>
    <p>Nearly 2,000 children took part in the Summer Off the Streets project we 
    ran between July and September last year. Hope to do the same this year. </p>
    <p>We have set up nine No Cold Calling areas in the district following 
    requests from residents. More are planned. This is all aimed at making 
    people feel safer. </p>
    <p>Neighbourhoods can set up their own management schemes and come up with 
    three priorities for the police to concentrate on. These priorities are 
    reviewed every three months. It will come as no surprise that anti-social 
    behaviour, criminal damage and speeding are popular priorities. </p>
    <p>I serve on the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership executive when 
    various agencies such as Glos CC, Police, PCT, Drug Rehabilitation, Alcohol 
    Abuse and the Prolific and Persistent Offenders group work together, not 
    only to make the area safer for residents but also to reduce the fear of 
    crime.</p>
    <p>Never be afraid to report a crime. </p>
    <p>The latest project for the executive is a crackdown on binge drinking. It 
    leads to all sorts of problems on the crime front and regarding personal 
    health. </p>
    <p>I also look after the council’s licensing team and last year we 
    introduced a new gambling policy, reviewed the council’s Licensing policy, 
    because the Government told us to. </p>
    <p>We have also reviewed the various license fees to determine the true cost 
    of providing the service. This will mean some increases in an attempt to 
    cover costs. </p>
    <p>We will soon be reviewing taxi fares following a request from local 
    drivers. </p>
    <p>In addition to that work I also have to try to keep control of Stow Gypsy 
    Fair. </p>
    <p>On top of all that I have my work for you – the people in the Ward. And 
    that usually means planning applications. I do my best to get answers within 
    24 hours. They may not be the answers people want to hear, but I can only 
    work within the rules as laid down by Government. </p>
    <p>And I have just remembered. I have now been put on the Cotswold Water 
    Park Committee.</p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR P. MESSENGER (CDC)</b> </p>
    <p>Cllr Messenger reported on his experience after his first year as a newly 
    elected District Councillor. He is currently serving on the Licensing 
    Committee and Housing Strategy Committee. Overall he was continuing to enjoy 
    the challenge but stated it was a very steep learning curve. Shortly he 
    would be seconded to the Severn &amp; Thames Canal Trust. It was disappointing 
    that British Waterways had withdrawn its support but Stroud District would 
    replace them. </p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR. P. CLARKE (CDC)</b> </p>
    <p>Thank you for the opportunity to present this report and thanks to Clerk, 
    Maurice McKee for drawing my attention to the fact that I was not receiving 
    Planning lists. That has now been remedied. </p>
    <p>Apart from my membership of Council, I am a member of the Licensing 
    Committee. I have asked to join the Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee 
    replacing Mrs Aram. If I am not appointed by the administration, I will 
    attend meetings as an observer as I have done to date as I believe it 
    essential for me to be involved. </p>
    <p>I also intend to regularly observe Cabinet which I have also done to 
    date. I continue to receive many complaints re the waste situation and the 
    issue of bus passes. </p>
    <p>As a Group and within our limited resources, we are now “shadowing” the 
    portfolios. I am shadowing “Sport, Culture and Enterprise” and “Strong and 
    Safe Communities”. I am experienced in these areas and the responsibilities 
    will not detract from my work as a Ward Councillor. I am already dealing 
    with a number of cases and have asked questions in Council. </p>
    <p>Since the election campaign, I have continued to pursue the issues I 
    raised at that time, particularly the continued operations of the 
    developers, the concerns of local people re access to parts of our side of 
    the Water Park and the state of the roads. I am also looking carefully at 
    the speed limits on the roads as I believe that some drivers are not 
    concerning themselves with observing speed limits in the interests of public 
    safety. </p>
    <p>After some difficulty, I have obtained the Water Park leases relating to 
    the County Council, the District Council, the Water Park Society and 
    Watermark so that I am aware of the detailed history. </p>
    <p>I am encouraged by the enlightened discussions at the Parish Council 
    meetings I attend which are helping me to get a much better understanding of 
    what is happening in the localities. Do make contact if I can be of use and 
    I will be delighted to answer any questions. Thanks again. </p>
    <p><b>REPORT FROM CLLR SHAUN PARSONS (GCC) </b> </p>
    <p>In comparison with the District Council’s budget of around £10 million 
    the County Council has a budget of £300 million. Cllr Parsons stated that it 
    was a campaign of his to make an improvement in the provision of youth 
    activities. He noted that efforts to persuade local authorities and others 
    had a marked effect in reducing the number of complaints about dirt on the 
    Spine Road in the past year. The major issue handled in the previous 12 
    months was the effect of flooding throughout the county. Moreton in Marsh in 
    this area was the epicentre of the storm and suffered as a result. Fairford 
    and Lechlade also experienced disruption on a large scale although South 
    Cerney escaped lightly in July. He praised the work of the Parish Council in 
    its prompt reaction to the potential danger it experienced in January. It 
    was disappointing that political promises of help, especially money, made 
    during the emergency had not been kept. A grant of £100 million from the 
    European Union had been reduced to a paltry £20 million for distribution. In 
    his view this was not surprising. Thanks must go to the Fire Service who 
    reacted magnificently during the crisis. </p>
    <p>Collection and disposal of waste will become a major concern as new taxes 
    come into force. The District Council is responsible for the collection and 
    the County Council for the disposal. Currently there is a Landfill tax of £8 
    per tonne but this will exponentially increase over the coming years and 
    become a major burden on rate paying residents in the future unless be 
    become more adept at recycling. A new incinerator on the outskirts of 
    Gloucester costing £170 million is planned to help with the disposal and 
    landfill sites become exhausted. </p>
    <p>Gloucestershire County Council has been awarded the highest category of 
    four stars after a comprehensive assessment. </p>
    <p>Cllr Parsons briefly stated that the Cotswold Water Park master plan when 
    implemented would provide guidance on the management and development of the 
    park. It was long overdue but he emphasised it was a starting point. </p>
    <p>The resurfacing of Broadway Lane which had been delayed due to the 
    sewerage works is planned for during this year. The “missing link” on the 
    A417 has been reduced by government to a local issue and is now unlikely to 
    be upgraded in the foreseeable future although pressure will continue to be 
    applied for an improvement to its status. During the past year, three deaths 
    have occurred which should certainly promote its improvement. </p>
    <p>Mr T. Squire enquired if the timing of the refurbishment of Broadway Lane 
    was planned during the calendar or financial year. Cllr Parsons had stated 
    that it was planned to resurface it in this calender year although it 
    depended on the completion of the sewerage works. </p>
    <p><b>INTRODUCTION FROM REVD DAVID BOWERS, VICAR AT ALL HALLOWS CHURCH</b> </p>
    <p>The Revd Bowers excused the lack of a report as he had only been in post 
    three and a half weeks. </p>
    <p>Since he arrived he has found the people of South Cerney very welcoming. 
    He told the meeting that he had been born in Salford, a suburb of Manchester 
    only three or four miles from Old Trafford and consequently was a United 
    fan. He was looking forward to watching the end of the match on the screen 
    in the hall after this meeting ended. He was ordained in 1984 and before his 
    appointment to South Cerney had served in the Tewkesbury area. Besides South 
    Cerney and Cerney Wick communities he was also responsible for Siddington 
    and Preston. His wife Judith was a nurse and he has two grown up children. 
    He gave a huge thanks to Tony Squire and Vicky for all the help they had 
    given to him in his first few weeks. Interests include the provision of 
    youth facilities and he enjoys networking with the community through for 
    example the school and the play group. </p>
    <p><b>SOUTH CERNEY UNITED CHURCH REPORT BY RETA-MAY MATTHEWS, SENIOR STEWARD 
    SOUTH CERNEY UNITED CHURCH</b> </p>
    <p>South Cerney United Church is truly a united church. We meet in a 
    Congregational building, serving a mostly Methodist congregation and are 
    currently led by a United Reformed minister. We have just over 30 members 
    and adherents and we welcome all denominations to worship and share in our 
    community activities. We are fully accredited to provide baptism, wedding, 
    funeral and pastoral care services. As part of a circuit which is undergoing 
    expansion, we are looking forward to exciting and challenging changes. </p>
    <p>Having planned and executed many significant improvements to our building 
    over the last decade, we are taking a short break from major fund raising 
    and restoration projects to concentrate on smaller mostly interior projects 
    including improved lighting, new carpeting for the main hall, the 
    installation of a loop system and updating of furnishings. Badly needed 
    pointing was completed earlier this year and you may recently have seen our 
    minister applying a coat or two of Danish oil to the exterior doors and 
    polishing the brass letters of our church sign. We had a new font in place 
    and dedicated at a baptism in January of this year and we hope soon to have 
    a matching lectern. With the closing of a sister church in Oakridge we 
    inherited an organ and other useful items. We also took the opportunity to 
    restore their Victorian pulpit resulting in a less imposing structure which 
    has been lightened to its original pine wood and lovingly hand polished with 
    beeswax. It was just delivered to us on Monday. We invite you to come in to 
    see this beautiful addition during the street fair on Bank Holiday Monday. </p>
    <p>We continue to offer weekly activities and services to our members and to 
    the community. These are all listed in the Cerney Newsletter, the Village 
    Directory and usually in the weekly Standard as well. If you drop in to see 
    us on Monday we will also have leaflets available. Other than two CDC 
    exercise classes, all our activities are run by unpaid volunteers from our 
    church and members of our Circuit churches. We are probably best known and 
    most appreciated in the village for support of the elderly and for 
    dedication to “Cerney Seedlings” our parents and toddlers group which has 
    been running since 1998. It currently has about 40 little ones on the active 
    register, many who come to us just a few days old and stay with us until 
    they are three or older. Our other community activities are meant to be all 
    inclusive but many seem to attract mostly the elderly. In recognition of 
    this, the South Cerney Parish Council has given us grants in both 2007 and 
    2008 to help support our elderly activities. This is much appreciated by all 
    who benefit. </p>
    <p>We have a very good relationship with All Hallows Church and we work in 
    conjunction with them to present a united Christian presence in the village. 
    They continue to use our building and share utility costs and other agreed 
    expenses. Income from rentals also goes into the Joint Church Account to 
    help defray these expenditures. All our rooms are available for rental and 
    with a “Safe from Harm” policy in place we are a popular venue for 
    children’s parties. St John’s Ambulance Courses are regularly held in the 
    building and the electric piano now gets a weekly work out from the new Jazz 
    group which meets there also. Village and local organisations use our rooms 
    from time to time as we keep the rental fees in line with those of the 
    Village Hall. </p>
    <p>First and foremost South Cerney United Church is a place of worship. Just 
    as you are invited to share in our community events, you are equally welcome 
    to come and worship with us anytime. In particular we would like to invite 
    you all to the Service of Dedication and Thanks for our new pulpit on Sunday 
    the 29th of June at 6pm.</p>
    <p><b>REPORT ON ANN EDWARDS CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIMARY SCHOOL READ BY ROGER 
    EDGAR ON BEHALF OF STEPHEN RICHARDSON HEADMASTER</b></p>
    <p><b>Personnel <br>
    </b>We have seen more changes in staff this year. Miss Linda Jones and Mrs 
    Susan Cook were taken on as teachers, one to replace Mrs Christine Hall and 
    one to job share with Mrs Vicki Roseblade who returned from her maternity 
    leave. Obviously saying goodbye to Christine Hall was a sad day for us all 
    but she has not managed to escape completely and has returned as a supply 
    teacher already. We have also welcomed Mrs Cathy Parker and Mrs Hazel 
    Gardiner as teaching assistants. The governing body has also seen more 
    changes with Mrs Karen 0 Hanley joining us as a parent governor. </p>
    <p><b>Curriculum and SATS</b> <br>
    All the children in KS2 and Y2 are about to take their optional or statutory 
    SATs and our SATs results for 2007 were very pleasing, with excellent 
    progress being made by children within the school, especially in maths and 
    at level 5 in maths, English and science, and pupils achieving well at the 
    end of K52. The school continues to offer a good quality of education for 
    its pupils and they receive a broad and balanced curriculum. We are a 
    category 2A school within the LEA. We were inspected by OFSTED in November 
    2007 and came out as satisfactory overall with some good features. We also 
    had our denominational inspection at the end of January and the report 
    showed the school to be strong in its integration of every child so that 
    they feel a valued part of the school community. That the environment was 
    one in which children felt safe and secure and the school had a strong 
    commitment to further the impact of the Christian ethos. </p>
    <p><b>Other extra curricular school activities</b> <br>
    The school continues to offer a full range of after school clubs including 
    for example, football, netball, tag rugby, cricket, rounders, cookery, 
    gardening, newspaper, computer, chess, bug club, scrabble club, modelling/warhammer 
    club, art and craft, stay and play, gymnastics and judo. These are well 
    attended by the pupils. Our Y4, Y5 and Y6 children have either taken part in 
    or will soon be taking part in residential visits to The Wilderness Centre, 
    Braeside, and Skern Lodge. We now offer an after school club from 3pm–6pm 
    run by Gooseberry Bush nursery and take up has been very good. Plans for a 
    breakfast club are being considered for September. Premier Sports now 
    coordinate our gymnastics club and offer tag rugby and football for KS1. </p>
    <p><b>Health 4 Schools</b> <br>
    We continue to take part in the above project with a view to increasing 
    children’s awareness of growing, cooking and eating their own food and 
    keeping fit. We have installed better cooking equipment in school and each 
    class has access to an area to grow vegetables and plants. Our broad beans 
    and other crops are looking good. Our toastie Tuesday initiative continues 
    to prove very popular and not far behind is our top up Thursday initiative 
    offering a bowl of cereal and a glass of fruit juice. We were awarded 
    Healthy Schools status this year. </p>
    <p><b>Other projects <br>
    </b>We have had visits from the Lifestyle Education Bus, various theatre 
    groups, Nick Williams the Birdwise man and the children have visited SCOEC. 
    Pupils will be taking part in the Dance Festival, schools swimming gala and 
    have played a number of sporting fixtures against other schools. We continue 
    to work closely with the Playgroup, allowing them to use part of our playing 
    field which has been fenced off to allow them more grass area. We have added 
    to our outdoor play equipment over the summer term – the tyre play system 
    has been a wonderful addition and the entrance to the school has been moved 
    to allow better access and exit from school. We have further plans to 
    install a Spiritual walk around the field perimeter. We are also exploring 
    ways in which to use the money allocated to our Travel Plan and would like 
    to liaise with the Parish Council on this matter to try and improve cycling 
    routes in the village or to install more child friendly signs in the 
    vicinity of the school.</p>
    <p>There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 9.08pm.</p>
