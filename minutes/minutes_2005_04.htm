    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 13th APRIL 2005</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart 
    welcomed Lynne Speak, Senior Manager of the Gloucestershire County Council’s 
    Cotswold Area Youth Services and the Cotswold Area Team Leader, Bernie Cox 
    to the meeting. Janet Lodge from South Cerney Youth Club was also present.<br>
    The meeting was presented with the 2005-06 Youth Work Plan for the Cotswold 
    Area which gave a detailed account of the activities and plans of the Youth 
    Service. Cllr Jay noted after quickly scanning the brochure that there was 
    very little mention of South Cerney even though its size when compared to 
    other catchment areas surely justified more of an input from the service. 
    The Education Centre at the eastern edge of the village and its attendant 
    mini bus was cited as a benefit although it was promptly pointed out that as 
    its location was remote and highly specialised in water sports it would only 
    suit a minority of local children. The perennial excuse for lack of 
    facilities was that the overall budget was not sufficient and had not been 
    increased. Other communities were funding schemes and finding partnerships 
    and it was gently suggested that South Cerney do likewise. The Youth Service 
    would facilitate grant applications although was powerless to apply directly 
    for any such funds. Agreement was reached that the Youth Service would carry 
    out research into youth needs through a survey of 13-18 year olds in 
    partnership with Janet Lodge the results of which would determine future 
    direction. Both guests responded positively to an invitation by Cllr Mrs 
    Pollard to attend the Village Plan open evening on June 23rd in the Village 
    Hall. Cllr Jay reminded the officers that every day four coach loads of 
    children from the community were bussed to Cirencester senior schools and 
    around 300 younger children attended Ann Edwards School. At 7.25pm Cllr 
    Stuart thanked both Lynne Speak and Bernie Cox for their attendance and both 
    left the meeting</p>

    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Harris had made an apology for his absence as he was on holiday, Cllr 
    Squire had apologised for his absence, Cllr Bennett (CDC) had emailed his 
    apology and Cllr Baines (CDC) had informed Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) that he 
    would not be present.<br>
    Six members of the public were present.<br>

    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 9th MARCH 2005</b><br>
    Page 1944: Post Office Collection – 2nd line change “collection” to read: 
    delivery<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Jay that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Rural Road Sweeping</b><br>
    Dr Amelia Mullins Waste and Sustainability Manager at CDC had given a 
    comprehensive list of reasons for the minimal action taken by the Cotswold 
    District Council to keep the Spine Road clear of mud. In her last paragraph 
    she summarised that as the issue is complex it may not easily be resolved. 
    The Clerk was asked to ascertain from her who was responsible for bringing 
    pressure on those responsible. Cllr Parsons (GCC) reported that he was 
    trying to get a working party organised to sort the problem. The consensus 
    of the meeting was that lack of funding was no excuse for inaction.<br>
    Naming of development off Meadow Way<br>
    The Clerk was asked to copy the response from CDC to the residents of the 
    Secret Garden which pointed out that the developer was responsible for 
    liaising with CDC on naming the development.<br>
    Speed Limit Roundel in Upper Up<br>
    A letter from Mr Bastow who lives at Tanners asked that the speed limit 
    roundel painted on the highway be removed. Chairman Cllr Stuart explained 
    the history which had led to the limit being painted on the roads throughout 
    the village. A request for four painted roadway signs at the gateways to the 
    village had been made plus one extra in Broadway Lane. Regardless of the 
    instruction GCC Highways had consequently painted eight roadway signs. The 
    Clerk was to ask Mr J. Whittaker (GCC Highways) to remove the sign in the 
    vicinity of the Royal Oak public house and Tanners in Upper Up.<br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs</b><br>
    A grant of £2,000 had been awarded by CDC to defray the cost of installing 
    interactive speed limit signs. Originally the Parish Council, on advice from 
    personnel at CDC, had applied for a grant of £6,000. Cllr Stuart asked Cllr 
    Mrs Clark (CDC) to investigate why the applied for grant had been reduced by 
    two-thirds.<br>
    <b>E-mail Storage</b><br>
    The Clerk was to enquire how much it would cost to provide a computer 
    storage facility to archive emails.<br>
    Cllr Caunce left the meeting having previously informed the Clerk that he 
    had a prior appointment.<br>
    <b>Roadway to rear of Willow Grove</b><br>
    Six residents from Willow Grove complained about the new roadway which had 
    been started to the rear of Willow Grove. Cllr Stuart assured them that the 
    CDC was aware and development should cease as planning permission was 
    required for the work. The Clerk reported that Mark Robson a police Wildlife 
    Officer was also involved as a badger set in the vicinity had been 
    disturbed. Cllr Jay was concerned that Watermark should behave in this way 
    without consultation and used the analogy of “manning the barricades” to 
    defend further incursions. Cllr Nicholas suggested that each instance should 
    be dealt with as it occurs and in every case be vigilant.<br>
    <b>Zebra Crossing</b><br>
    Mr Sam Beard came to the meeting to enquire if rumours he had heard about 
    the imminent construction of the crossing were factual. Cllr Stuart 
    explained the history of the decision and its process. The Parish Council 
    had previously voted in favour of its installation. It was now up to GCC 
    Highways to decide where and when it would be installed after consulting 
    with those residents in its immediate vicinity. Cllr Stuart assured Mr Beard 
    that the location and design of the crossing had yet to be determined by the 
    experts. Cllr Parsons (GCC) would ask John Whittaker to put forward 
    proposals and the process of implementation.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Monday 14th March I received a series of phone calls from Mr Bushnell of 
    1 Sudeley Drive regarding a letter I wrote asking him to cut back his 
    overhanging hedge. When during the first call I asked him not to be so 
    abusive he became even more so. I therefore disconnected the call. Shortly 
    afterwards I recalled the following from the 1571 service. “You have not the 
    courage to pick up the telephone which just goes to confirm what a small 
    minded bunch of (bleeps) you represent.” About five minutes later another 
    call in similar vein enquiring why I was not a resident of South Cerney (no 
    comment) and poking my nose into other people’s business. More expletives to 
    emphasise his complaints and finally a threat of what he might do to me if 
    he could get hold of me. I reported the incident to Cllr Squire and played 
    the first recording over to him. On Sunday 2 April I accompanied Cllr Stuart 
    to a meeting with Mr Ben Knight a member of Siddington Parish Council to 
    discuss our proposed scheme to provide a cycle path from South Cerney to 
    Siddington. Mr Knight is also a land owner and tenant of land over which the 
    old railway line passes and explained how this artery is vital to the 
    working of his farm. He argued his point, not as a member of Siddington 
    Parish Council but as a concerned resident. On Tuesday 12th April I attended 
    a meeting of Siddington Parish Council with Cllr Stuart. The proposed speed 
    limit from Preston Toll Bar to South Cerney was discussed as were footpaths 
    and bridleways of mutual interest. During March I averaged 4 hours 25 
    minutes each day over the 13 available working days which is some 22.5% in 
    excess of my contract.<br>
    Cllr Jay was concerned that the Parish Council should make every effort to 
    protect its employee from abuse and asked the Clerk to contact his 
    association for advice. The Parish Council was wholeheartedly supportive of 
    its Clerk.<br>
    Cllr Stuart gave a brief account of his meeting with Siddington Parish 
    Council summarising that the proposed cycle route from South Cerney to 
    Siddington would stand a much greater chance of implementation if the 
    preferred route was along the old canal. Siddington Parish Council supported 
    the reduction in the speed limits from Preston Toll Bar to South Cerney and 
    the creation of the pathway from South Cerney through the reed beds at 
    Shorncote to the Water Park at Somerford Keynes.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish 
    Council agrees to the proposed reduction of the current speed limits along 
    the Preston Toll Bar to South Cerney road by 10 mph i.e. the 50 mph to 40 
    mph and the 40 mph to 30 mph and the repositioning of the 30 mph road sign 
    in Silver Street some 150 metres north towards Preston Toll Bar. The Parish 
    Council was in agreement.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart deputised for Cllr Squire, who had sent an apology for his 
    absence, and reported on the deliberations of the Committee which had met on 
    Monday 11th April.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Barrier on old railway track</b><br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to remind Cotswold Water Park that the barrier 
    on the old railway track near the Robert Franklin Way playing area with the 
    inscribed message had not yet been replaced. Also, the barrier at the end of 
    the bridleway, which is part of the disused railway line from Cerney Wick to 
    Spine Road, is in disrepair.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Abuse of footpaths</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce suggested that support from the local riding schools be 
    encouraged to educate horse riders to abstain from using dedicated footpaths 
    as bridleways. Particular mention was made of the paths from Box Bush to 
    Robert Franklin Way and Sudeley Drive to Ham Lane.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that all equipment was in working order. 
    Unaccompanied dogs were becoming a problem on the play area. The one 
    laminated panel on the adventure unit in the toddlers play area had been 
    removed.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order.<br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    The damaged basketball netting had been removed. The plastic recycling skip 
    installed on the car park was well used. Gaps in the safety tiles were still 
    hazardous although larger splits appeared to be closing and smaller gaps 
    widening. The Committee agreed that the Clerk enquire from Macventure Play 
    Co and R.O.W. Berry if either were willing to make an offer for the safety 
    tiles. The Clerk was asked to make the replacement of safety tiles an agenda 
    item for next month’s meeting. Cllr Stuart reported a request from users of 
    the humps and bumps that they be allowed to redesign the little humps which 
    were less than 2ft high. The Committee agreed to have further consultations 
    to determine who might be a responsible leader within the group to supervise 
    the action. Cllr Caunce had informed Cllr Stuart that Ermin Plant Hire would 
    supply a digger free of charge for the project although a licensed driver 
    would be needed to operate the equipment. Cllr Squire was in negotiation 
    with 29 Regt for them to use a helicopter on exercise to reposition the 
    large metal container which the Cricket Club uses as an equipment store. The 
    Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Stuart that when the 
    container is repositioned a brick wall is built at one end for football 
    kicking practice. This would provide an alternative to the pavilion which is 
    sometime used for this activity and also make the container more visually 
    acceptable.<br>

    <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart echoed the concern of the Committee at the new road which was 
    being made on Lake 16 at the back of Kingfisher Place, Huxley Court and 
    Willow Grove as no planning permission had been granted for such work. The 
    Clerk was asked to enquire from Gloucestershire Constabulary if a report had 
    been made regarding the criminal disturbance around the badger set to the 
    rear of Huxley Court and Willow Grove.<br>
    Cllr Jay on behalf of South Cerney Trust informed the Committee that it 
    would like to remove and/or resite the waste bin at the Cross and also to 
    upgrade the corner of land at the end of School Lane and Silver Street by 
    providing a concrete plinth for the Coronation seat and pave the rest of the 
    area. The South Cerney Trust had allowed a budget of £1,000 for both 
    projects. The Committee agreed to recommend both schemes to the Parish 
    Council. The Parish Council was grateful to the South Cerney Trust for this 
    generous offer and quotes would be sought for the work.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on 11th April.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/4/B</b><br>
    Additional/Amended Plans: The provision of a service area with associated 
    gardener’s shed and the retention of the existing access onto the Spine Road 
    for the use of service lorries only at Lake 16, Spine Road, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/4/D</b><br>
    Minor Amendment: Additional pair of doors in place of window to north-east 
    elevation at South Cerney Works, Ham Lane, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1454/4/D</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr M. Thomas, c/o Watermark, Isis Lakes, Spine Road, South Cerney<br>
    Erection of a restaurant, hotel with associated car parking at Lake 7, 
    Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney<br>
    The Committee agreed that this proposal would fundamentally change the 
    character of this rural location as viewed from the adjoining footpaths. The 
    Committee was concerned as to the precise appearance of the planned building 
    as there were no details describing the roof colour to be used. If 
    permission was granted then development of the site should be put on hold 
    until the sewerage problem affecting South Cerney has been resolved. During 
    construction a vehicle wheel wash installed and used to stop mud being taken 
    on to the highway by contractors’ vehicles. A dedicated lane is installed to 
    allow traffic accessing the completed site to turn right. A reduction in the 
    current speed limit to 40 mph in the adjoining area be imposed.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2475/1/X</b><br>
    Applicant: Glen Brooks, GB Cooker Spares, Chelworth Industrial Estate, 
    Cricklade, Wilts<br>
    Erection of 37 Industrial Units of various sizes associated parking and car 
    park at rear (reserved matters for application CT.2475/1/L) on land at

    <b>COUNCILLORS’ PORTFOLIOS</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard updated the Parish Council on the progress being made by 
    the Village Plan sub committee which had met on Thursday 7th April at her 
    house. The meeting consisted of Cllr Stuart, Cllr Squire, Cllr Mrs Pollard, 
    the Clerk, Dr Peter Stephenson, Steven Walker, Patrick Mills and Melanie 
    Tarrant from GRCC. It was agreed then that an Open Evening will be held on 
    Thursday 23rd June from 7–9pm in the Village Hall to which residents, 
    representatives from local business, local organisations, CDC and GCC would 
    be welcomed to come and view the draft plan and add any ideas they may have. 
    Those interested would be encouraged to join a working party to help us 
    achieve an even better South Cerney. Another meeting prior to the Open 
    Evening will be held on Tuesday 10 May at 6.30pm to fine tune the 
    arrangements.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported that he had forwarded an advertisement from PALS, which 
    hoped to recruit volunteers, to the editor of Cerney News for publication 
    and returned a questionnaire to the Gloucestershire Partnership NHS Trust.<br>
    Cllr Webb had attended a seminar on conifers and recalled how surprised he 
    was to find out how numerous were the different species.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) if she could arrange for him to 
    attend the next meeting of the Flood Forum scheduled for June.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that no new road markings to notify drivers of a 
    30mph limit zone had been painted on roads through Cerney Wick.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PARISH FOOTPATHS</b><br>
    Cllr Smith reported that one of the steps on the staircase near Chapter 
    Manor in Bow Wow to the old railway line was dangerous. Cllr Stuart informed 
    Cllr Smith that the steps were not a public footpath and it had not proved 
    possible to ascertain ownership or responsibility for their repair. The 
    Clerk was to contact Mr M. Mould who had historically repaired the steps 
    voluntarily and ask him if he would fix them.<br>
    Cllr Smith reported that the stile and bridge at the western end of BSC6 and 
    BSC7 where they pass through Berry’s Farm was in disrepair. GCC Public 
    Rights of Way officers were aware of the problems. Cllr Stuart stated that 
    when the section of footpath from the western boundary of the Upper Up 
    playing fields to the Thames Water reed beds is opened it will alleviate the 
    problem.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported that the Cotswold Water Park signpost near the Lock House 
    at the end of Wildmoorway Lane (BSC1 and BSC20) where the bridge goes over 
    the river had been reversed by vandals and was causing confusion to visiting 
    walkers. The Clerk was asked to inform the CWP rangers.<br>
