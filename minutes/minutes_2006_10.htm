 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman, Cllr Stuart welcomed PC Chris Freeman to the 
 meeting. PC Freeman commented on recent press reports regarding PCSO Pooley 
 emphasising that the Gloucestershire Constabulary was very satisfied with how 
 she carried out her duties. On behalf of the Parish Council Cllr Harris will 
 propose a vote of confidence and appreciation later in the proceedings. Cllr 
 Jay remarked that residents who reported the vandalism to the bollards in 
 Station Road through the emergency number did not receive any feedback or 
 follow up and felt let down by the service. Cllr Stuart reported that two 
 windows in the village hall had been broken by youths throwing chestnuts. 
 Unfortunately, those occupying the hall at the time did not apprehend the 
 culprits. PC Freeman highlighted the need for the public to cooperate with 
 police especially in reporting crime. Too often members of the public refused 
 to come forward and this stymied police action. Cllr Stuart requested that the 
 Police Press Officer prepare a news report for publication in the Cerney News 
 as agreed when Cllr Stuart attended a Police Liaison meeting. PC Freeman 
 informed Parish Councillors that the mobile police station had visited the 
 Crown car park in Cerney Wick on 4th October and would return on the 26th 
 October, 13th November and 24th November. PC Freeman commented that the 
 Smartwater demonstration in the village hall on 3rd October had been poorly 
 attended. He was enthusiastic about its benefits to the police comparing it to 
 post coding for the 21st century. It was slow to decay and could be easily 
 detected by ultra violet light even in public places. A further demonstration 
 will be considered but better coordination with other groups and more 
 noticeable advertisement would be necessary. PC Freeman finally then announced 
 that another PCSO would be allocated to the Parish in the near future. Cllr 
 Harris commented that the officer would be most welcome. PC Freeman left the 
 meeting and Cllr Stuart then opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.51pm.</p>

 <p ALIGN="LEFT">Cllr Caunce had made an apology as he was occupied with family 
 business. Cllr Pollard had made an apology for her absence as she was on 
 holiday. Cllr Parsons (GCC) had informed the Clerk that he was unable to attend 
 as he was otherwise engaged.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Nicholas 
 that the Minutes were a true and accurate record. With the exception of Cllr 
 Stuart who was absent from the meeting and Cllr Jay who abstained, the 
 remainder of the Parish Council was in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Youth Parish Councillors Dan Mills and Dom Brown 
 represented their group and began by requesting individual Parish Councillors 
 to support them as marshals at their proposed Fun Run at Upper Up playing field 
 which was scheduled to be held on Sunday 29th October starting at 1.30pm. Cllr 
 Nicholas said that he and Cllr Caunce would be there and 6 other Parish 
 Councillors present also volunteered. Cllr Stuart informed the YPC that PCSO 
 Lesley Pooley had planned to be present in an official capacity. The Parish 
 Council encouraged the YPC to advertise the event as widely as possible and 
 suggested various positions throughout the village where this might be done. An 
 offer from Cllr Stuart of the sandwich boards which promoted the cinema was 
 accepted. Dom Brown will design a poster which he will email to the Clerk for 
 duplication and lamination. Both Youth Councillors left the meeting at 8.05pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 21st September I attended a meeting in the 
 Village Hall chaired by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP to discuss the progress of a 
 plan by Thames Water to update the South Cerney sewerage and surface water 
 system. There were 17 people present including Parish Councillors Stuart and 
 Webb, District Councillors Bennett and Mrs Clark, three representatives from 
 Thames Water, Rob Bull (CDC) and residents. The plan to refurbish the system 
 which will cost in the region of £5 million is almost complete and work is 
 expected to start early in 2007 and last approximately 9 months. There will be 
 drop-in sessions where information on events will keep residents aware of what 
 is going on. There are on-going problems with the intermittent malodorous 
 stench in the system although Andrew Bell (Thames Water) was confident that 
 through a process of elimination a solution will be found. Overall it was 
 agreed with a statement by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP that Thames Water had kept 
 to its promise to expedite the work and was to be congratulated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Playahead had quoted £262.73 for two cradle seats to 
 replace those reported damaged on the Upper Up playing field. Sutcliffe had 
 quoted £255.92. Both suppliers had added VAT and delivery. R.O.W. Berry has 
 quoted £50 labour to install the seats. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I discussed with Guy Wakefield his reply to the Parish 
 Council’s reaction to the initial offer from Bloor Homes. He verbally confirmed 
 that his original offer of £15,000 was still on the table, if acceptable. He 
 explained that the offer was based on what was agreed for the Limes, i.e. the 
 Limes was a development of 29 houses with 3 socially owned whereas the Bloor 
 development in Berkeley Close was 23 houses with 50% socially owned. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A&amp;B Fencing had verbally quoted £526 plus VAT to refurbish 
 the three bar wooden fence at Upper Up car park. It was pointed out that as the 
 current installation was to Imperial dimensions the replacement fence using 
 metric measurements would not match exactly and there would be some 
 misalignment. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During August of the 17 available working days I averaged 
 4 hours per day which is approximately 10 per cent above par for my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was reminded to enquire from Gloucestershire 
 Constabulary its opinion of the web site BetterDrivingPlease.com </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to contact Alf Reynolds, GCC Road 
 Safety Officer and request the loan of the speed gun. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay was adamant that positive action be taken to 
 control pets, especially dogs, which fouled the play area. Besides being 
 against the law it was dangerous and antisocial not to clear up after a pet had 
 fouled a public play area or any other place. He was of the opinion that dogs 
 must be kept on a lead while accessing the playing field. Cllr Smith argued 
 that there was no law which ordered that dogs must be kept on a lead although 
 there was one which said that dogs must be under control. Cllr Stuart stated 
 that it was time the Parish Council’s byelaws were updated in order to reduce 
 dog mess on Upper Up and throughout the village. Cllr Jay would ask the Clerk 
 to make the item an agenda item for next month’s meeting adding that it should 
 be the intention of South Cerney Parish Council (subject to appropriate legal 
 advice) to introduce a “Dogs must be kept on a lead” policy for its gardens and 
 play areas. Cllr Smith agreed to contact Richard Bellis, GAPTC for information 
 on how the law affects our authority and report back to the next Parish Council 
 meeting in November. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) stated that the law regarding control 
 of dogs was currently under review.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Field and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 9th October. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that he had invited members of the 
 YPC, through their forum on the web site, to meet with him to discuss a risk 
 assessment to be carried out prior to the planned Fun Run on the Upper Up 
 playing fields. Unfortunately, no member of the YPC had yet made contact. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Speed Limits</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that one of the interactive speed signs was now in 
 operation and asked the Clerk to enquire when the other two might be 
 operational. Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to ascertain the results, if any, of 
 the Parish Council’s request to Gloucestershire Police to have a speed check on 
 the Cirencester Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that Hills would be providing a skip free of charge. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reinstatement of river bank in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported on a meeting he had with Jennifer Watkins, Senior Highway 
 Representative at Gloucestershire Highways and a GCC Works Team Leader to 
 discuss the refurbishment of the river bank. A Gloucestershire Highways team 
 would make sure that all road markings and notices were legal.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that everything on the playing field was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
 Cllr Harris noted that an attempt had been made to build a small fire in the 
 carriage of the train unit. An unnoticed loose locking nut had been replaced. 
 Cllr Harris also made minor repairs to the tower slide unit. The goal posts 
 needed soil. Dog mess had been removed from the fenced off play area which 
 specifically bars dogs from entry.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b><br>
 Replacement cradle seats were still awaited. A team from the Payback in the 
 Community had spread soil, delivered by Cllr Harris, between the Senior Swing, 
 Slide and Activity Area. Cllr Stuart had planted grass seed on 7th October. A 
 plastic bath dumped near the Cycle Mounds needs to be removed. The fence on the 
 north side of the car park had been pushed over. Cllr Stuart considers that 
 this presents a security hazard and should be repaired urgently. The surface of 
 the car park is very poor and needs attention. Cllr Stuart remarked that he 
 could only find one dog mess on the playing field and wondered what all the 
 fuss was about. The concrete shed used by the Cricket and Football clubs is no 
 longer needed and should be removed. The Pay Back in the Community team could 
 demolish it but a skip would be needed to remove the debris. A resident who had 
 purchased a tree had asked for permission to plant daffodils at its base. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris was not in favour with the planting of flowers 
 at Upper Up. He argued that it would turn the area into an urban park which, in 
 his view, was contrary to its intended theme. A proposal was not considered but 
 it was agreed to discuss the issue at Parish Council, at which time after a 
 short debate, Parish Councillors concurred with Cllr Harris. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart produced a dog fouling notice, in cartoon 
 form, he had sourced on a recent holiday to the Lake District where the local 
 council threatened dog owners whose pets fouled the neighbourhood with a fine 
 of £1,000. He suggested that CDC might be encouraged to increase its £75 
 penalty to a more meaningful amount. The Committee discussed the issue of dog 
 fouling on Upper Up but there was no consensus on further action as enforcement 
 would be problematic. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart proposed and Cllr Mrs Chubb seconded a motion 
 that the committee agrees to purchase and install two replacement cradle seats 
 for £305.92 including VAT. The Committee was all in favour. The Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee accepts this proposal. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris proposed and Cllr Stuart seconded a motion 
 that the committee agrees to instruct A&amp; B Fencing to refurbish the fence to 
 the north of the car park at Upper Up for £618.05 including VAT. The Committee 
 was all in favour. The Committee recommended that the Finance Committee accepts 
 this proposal.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in
 Berkeley Close</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Guy Wakefield had responded to the Parish Council’s reply 
 to his first offer by lowering his verbal contribution to £12,462.37 from his 
 initial £15,000. At the Monday Committee meeting, Cllr Caunce asked for an 
 explanation on how a sum of £174.48 for an annual grass cut had been assessed. 
 Before any realistic discussion could continue it was necessary that Bloor 
 Homes provide a detailed plan and specification of its proposals. The Clerk 
 informed the Committee that Guy Wakefield would be prepared to honour his 
 initial offer if acceptable. Cllr Stuart was not in favour of taking on any 
 responsibility for the area as the proposed calculations for a commuted sum 
 were out of touch with reality. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Smartwater Demonstration</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart was disappointed at the lack of interest shown 
 in the Smartwater demonstration recently held in the Village Hall. He had been 
 joined by Cllr Webb, Brian Corke, Peter and Rowena Merson and two residents 
 from Harnhill.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Councillors’ Reports</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Monday Committee meeting, Cllr Caunce reported on 
 alleged sheep worrying incidents in Cerney Wick, presumably carried out by a 
 large dog. Cllr Harris suggested that pet owners be advised to keep their 
 animals under control in the presence of livestock, especially sheep. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Monday Committee meeting, Cllr Caunce was also 
 concerned that he may have a prejudicial interest in decisions regarding 
 Watermark some time in the future. He was advised to contact Richard Belliss
 <a href="mailto:(richardb@grcc.org.uk">(richardb@grcc.org.uk</a>). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris referred to an offer from Mr Mould, Lower 
 Mill, Bow Wow to install low level lighting in the vicinity of the footbridge 
 and wondered if this was an opportune time to remind him of his proposal. Cllr 
 Squire volunteered to speak on the subject to Mr Mould. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Following some recent critical press reporting of PCSO 
 Lesley Pooley, Cllr Harris recommended that the Parish Council consider a vote 
 of confidence in PCSO Pooley and her valuable contribution to upholding the law 
 in South Cerney and Cerney Wick Parish. At the Monday meeting the Committee was 
 all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris proposed and Cllr Jay seconded a motion that 
 this Parish Council has total confidence in PCSO Lesley Pooley and support her 
 in her duties within the community. With the exception of Cllr Mrs Chapman and 
 Cllr Smith who abstained the remainder of the Parish Council was in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb complained that when Station Road was 
 closed for the repair of the sewerage pipe, some irresponsible motorists had 
 moved the barriers to circumvent the road closure. Station Road had been closed 
 to traffic from around 7pm on Thursday 28th September until late afternoon 
 Wednesday 4th October. The Parish Council agreed that a letter be sent to both 
 Gloucestershire Highways and Thames Water informing them that it was 
 unacceptable for the main road through the village to be closed for such a long 
 time. Gloucestershire Highways were to be asked to inspect the repair as Cllr 
 Mrs Chubb complained that traffic noise had increased when vehicles crossed 
 over probably due to it being uneven. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that after the recent sewage leak 
 the smell emanating from the open ditch in Station Road was obnoxious. The 
 Clerk was asked to enquire from Thames Water if it was prepared to either 
 remove by mechanical means the contaminated herbage and mud from the ditch or 
 to pay for the cost of clearing the ditch as effluent was now lodged in the 
 herbage creating the awful smell. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that Roger Sollis (CDC) had informed 
 him that if the Parish Council was in agreement a Salvation Army clothing 
 recycling bin would be installed on the Upper Up car park. On Monday evening 
 the Committee was in full agreement. The Parish Council concurred with its 
 decision.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart informed the Committee that Mike Barton (PROW) 
 had forwarded photographs of apparatus which could be installed to obstruct 
 bicycle users from accessing footpaths. He expects to be able to erect such 
 barriers in the next financial year on the footpath between Station Road and 
 Bow Wow bridge. After some discussion the Parish Council decided that it was 
 not in favour of such obstructions as it would not solve the problem of 
 cyclists using the alternative path through another area of Box Bush estate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that Thames Water utilities was in 
 the final design stage of the line the new sewerage link to Shorncote would 
 take. Work was expected to start in the first week of the coming new year and 
 completion of the Upper Up phase expected sometime in the following March. 
 Chris Graham from Moore Allen and Innocent was acting on behalf of the Parish 
 Council as agreed and the Clerk had collected documents which should be signed 
 on behalf of the Parish Council. Having said on Monday, Cllr Nicholas agreed to 
 scrutinise them prior to them being signed. Cllr Nicholas reported that most 
 probably there would be no financial gain but the Parish Council could expect 
 reinstatement of the land when work was completed. On the question of land 
 drains Cllr Nicholas recommended that Chris Graham liaised with the Cricket 
 Club. When complete it was advisable not to plant large trees near to the line 
 of the pipework. It would be prudent if Chris Graham was to consult with Cllr 
 Harris on how the pipe may affect the Shire Ditch. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr 
 Smith that the Parish Council continue to instruct Chris Graham, Moore Allen 
 and Innocent to act to protect the interests of the Parish Council in 
 negotiations with Thames Water. The Parish Council was all in favour. Cllr 
 Nicholas recommended that the documents relating to the pipework over the 
 playing field should be signed. The Chairman, Cllr Stuart then signed the 
 documents. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart recommended that the Parish Council writes to 
 the Managing Director of the Four Pillars hotel building project on the Spine 
 Road to request that contractors using the site, Builders Ede use a wheel wash 
 before accessing the highway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported that Lady Fanshawe had called the 
 police when intruders had entered her property recently. The police response 
 was made within 15 minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith reported on the deliberations of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on the 9th October.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising <br>
 </b>Cllr Jay informed the Committee that the South Cerney Trust had declined to 
 make a contribution to the supervision of the refurbishment of the river bank 
 in Bow Wow as it considered the project was managed by the Parish Council 
 although it was much in favour of the scheme. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YPC Meeting</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay reported on a meeting of the YPC he had attended during which he 
 explained the procedure that is followed for payments made by the Parish 
 Council. He presented the YPC with a ream of paper but pointed out that 
 incidental expenses should be recorded and verified before the Parish Council 
 would approve payment. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in 
 Berkeley Close</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart queried if the Committee wanted to commit its successors to 
 maintaining the proposed public open space at Bloor Homes’ development in 
 Berkeley Close. The costings provided by Guy Wakefield were totally unrealistic 
 and more meaningful figures were needed if the Parish Council was minded to 
 considering approval.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Land purchase at Limes</b> <br>
 Mr Kevan Kelsey had enquired whether the Parish Council would consider the sale 
 of land it maintained at the Limes. Cllr Nicholas informed that the Parish 
 Council that the land was subject to a restrictive covenant which effectively 
 prevents it being used for any purpose other than as a public open space. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Web site use</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire enquired if there was any objection to information being published 
 on the web site about the restoration of the window in the church. The Parish 
 Council had no objection. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cricket Club funding request</b> <br>
 Due to an overspend on maintenance work carried out to its playing surface the 
 Cricket Club had written to ask that the Parish Council consider making a 
 financial contribution to defray the cost. Cllr Nicholas requested that the 
 Cricket Club be asked to provide an explanation as to how the expenditure 
 occurred. Cllr Jay reminded the Committee that such a commitment had not been 
 budgeted for and must therefore be discussed during the coming precept 
 negotiations.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING</b> </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reiterated that, according to GCC public 
 footpaths map, Ham Lane was not a public right of way although it had been used 
 by pedestrians in the past. Cllr Squire had been contacted on four separate 
 occasions by residents enquiring if anything could be done to reopen the lane 
 where it joined the Fishing Club lake. The Parish Council agreed that Cllr 
 Squire should speak with Mrs Pearce regarding the possibility of creating a 
 PROW on Ham Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FLOOD FORUM REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on a Flood Forum he had attended at 
 CDC. He was very impressed with the input from Lawrence Adams, Thames Water who 
 had seen the job through from the start and was totally aware of the 
 implications and deficiencies of the system. Work on the new sewerage system 
 would start early in the new year and should be completed next September 
 although slippage in the timetable could occur if environmental problems arise. 
 Odour problems in the Kingfisher Place area were still being investigated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VILLAGE PLAN PROGRESS</b> </p>

 involved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Item 8 Cllr Stuart has regular contact with Mike Barton 
 GCC PROW and is trying to overcome objections to opening up a footpath between 
 South Cerney and Siddington through to Cirencester.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that part of Objective 9 to publicise 
 existing footpaths had very nearly been achieved. South Cerney had partnered 
 the Water Park Society and a new booklet of local walks was currently being 
 printed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire had measured distances between lamp posts in 
 Broadway Lane and would report his observations to Mr B. Greenaway, Road 
 Lighting Manager at GCC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Regarding Item 11 Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to enquire 
 from Thames Water if it had any objections to the Parish Council siting a MUGA 
 over the line of the soon to be redundant sewerage pipe. The Clerk was to 
 contact GPFA to ascertain if it could send a representative to meet with the 
 YPC.</p>
