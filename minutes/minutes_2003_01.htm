    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 8th JANUARY 2003</strong></p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm with Chairman Cllr Mrs J. Gardiner welcoming Mr
    John Whittaker GCC Road Traffic Manager and two members of the public. She went on to
    outline that the main concerns of the Parish Council were traffic speed through the
    village, the lack of a footpath in Silver Street near Berry Farm, the continuing presence
    of the bollards and the necessity for traffic calming devices at the four gateways to the
    village. PC 1208 McCorquodale arrived at 7.05pm replacing PC Richard Kent who was unable
    to attend through illness. Cllr Mrs Spriggs was in favour of a physical restriction to
    slow down traffic at entrances to the village. Cllr Nicholas said that it was difficult to
    slow down traffic at the start of the 30mph restriction. Mr Whittaker pointed out that he
    was not responsible for the bollards in Station Road and High Street near to the entrance
    of the Limes. He stated that he would contact Gary Handley GCC Road Safety Officer and ask
    him to provide the Parish Council with an information pack. He suggested that if a 40mph
    restriction was to precede the 30mph notice this could help to slow down traffic. PC
    McCorquodale agreed that it was easier to police a 30mph zone if such a buffer was in
    place. Cllr Mrs Spriggs proposed that if the 30mph limit on Cirencester Road was moved
    further out it would give drivers more opportunity to slow down rather than at present
    where sight of the restriction just after a bend gave little time for vehicles to comply.
    Cllr Nicholas commented that only one of the two crossing points for school children was
    patrolled by a lolly pop lady although the crossing in High Street was signed but
    unattended. Unfortunately the school had been unable to recruit another patrol person for
    High Street. PC McCorquodale stated that police action to control speeding drivers was
    intelligence led. Cllr Stuart suggested to the Constable that a patrol should be
    considered between 7.30am and 9am. Mr Whittaker stated that Road Safety has a radar gun
    which can be borrowed by communities to provide intelligence to the police for them to
    action. Cllr Mrs Gardiner read a written submission from Cllr Mrs Pearse in which she
    stated that she would like to see beige coloured tarmac on all four entrance roads with
    large speed limit signs painted on. She argued that this would give an illusion of
    narrowing the road as the sides are usually drawn in with white paint. It was Cllr Mrs
    Pearse's view that the type of calming introduced in Oaksey or Penhill was not suitable in
    a village environment and only increased driver aggravation which caused more speeding and
    not less. Cllr Nicholas pointed out that the Parish Council had budgeted £10,000 for
    traffic calming to which Mr Whittaker replied that GCC Highways would match any Parish
    contribution. In reply to a query on the possibility of installing traffic bumps he
    responded that these were difficult to install and of limited use as the maximum height of
    such bumps was only 65mm. Mr Whittaker confirmed that he would get a consultant to prepare
    a costed plan for improvements and present it to the Parish Council for its consideration.
    Cllr Harris asked if any action could be taken against motorists who parked opposite the
    disabled access at Langet entrance in Upper Up making it hazardous for wheeled chairs and
    prams to cross the road. PC McCorquodale agreed that this was a common problem and
    difficult to enforce apart from in an exceptional circumstance. Mr Whittaker suggested
    that an elongated H painted on the road might help deter motorists. Cllr Mrs Gardiner
    thanked both PC McCorquodale and Mr Whittaker for attending and they left the meeting at
    7.37pm.</p>

    All payments to suppliers were dispatched and response forms faxed to CDC. On 12 December
    I attended a meeting of the Cirencester Partnership at Deer Park School with Cllr

    The group will meet again, probably in late January or February.<br>
    On 13 December I attended a meeting of the Gloucestershire branch of the SLCC at
    Brickworth, near Cheltenham. In the evening I visited Mrs McKinnon at 52 The Lennards to
    show her a copy of planning application CT.8276 to which the Parish Council had objected.
    The application was for the erection of a house on land adjoining Dryft Cottage in Station
    Road which is directly behind her home. On 18 December I met with Cllr King and we
    prepared the basis for the Risk Assessment.<br>
    On 23 December I ordered a new public seat from Glasdon's. Today I was informed by them

    <strong>Precept</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner on behalf of the Finance Committee presented its precept proposal to the
    Parish Council. The major change in this year's budget was the Village Hall Grant which
    the Committee proposed to increase to £12,110. Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Mrs Spriggs and Cllr
    Stuart declared a prejudicial interest as members of the Village Hall Committee and took
    no part in this section the debate. If agreed this would mean that the precept would be
    £43,150 making a contribution of £32.91 per band 'D' household. This represented an
    annual decrease of £2.72 or 8.265% reduction. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner,
    seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council agrees to the budget. Eight Parish
    Councillors voted in favour and 3 abstained. The precept was therefore agreed.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 6 January.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    Bollards<br>
    Cllr Stuart was concerned that no action had yet been taken to remove the bollards in High
    Street which were creating a traffic hazard.<br>
    Street Lighting<br>
    There had been no further contact with Barry Greenaway on this matter.<br>
    Upper Up Tower Slide<br>

    Concrete Base for Bench at Limes<br>

    on the alterations made to the ramp.<br>
    Tree Survey<br>
    Committee members agreed to make the survey on 12 January.<br>
    Sub Station at Limes<br>
    As no action had as yet been taken to secure the sub station at the Limes the Clerk was
    asked to contact Bell Contracting Ltd which was the contractor responsible.<br>
    Upper Up Car Park<br>
    Two quotes had now been received but one was still awaited.<br>
    Mr Wrightson<br>
    The Committee recommends that a item be placed in Cerney News thanking Mr Wrightson for
    the effort he makes in collecting rubbish in Station Road.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on his inspections. At Upper Up the rubber seats on the junior swings
    were showing signs of cracking and will need careful watching. The seats on the senior
    swings must be renewed now. The new climbing wall had been fitted to the tower slide and
    is being well used despite the bad weather. The fence rail to left of entrance of the car
    park is broken and presents a dangerous hazard. Cllr Harris volunteered to collect and fit
    a replacement rail at cost. The Parish Council was all in favour. At Robert Franklin Way
    the bark will need topping up soon. The stile at the southern end of Robert Franklin way
    play area had been patched up. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr
    Gardiner that James Harris Contracting redesign the stile to a lower level as a
    conventional two step stile for a maximum of £30. With the exception of Cllr Harris who
    declared an interest the Parish Council was all in favour. At Cerney Wick all four seats
    on the swings need replacing and surrounding area requires to be swept. The hand rail to
    the bridge over the culvert on the right of the entrance has been ripped out. Cllr Harris
    declared an interest when it was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Dunn that
    James Harris Contracting be allowed £50 to make the repair. With the exception of Cllr
    Harris who declared an interest the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>RISK ASSESSMENT</strong><br>
    Cllr King explained the matrix and the methods of control for a scheme to assess risks for
    the Parish Council. Under each section, space had been left for Parish Councillors to add
    any further risks they may deem applicable. The form would be debated in more detail at
    next month's Parish Council meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>GROUND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS</strong><br>
    The Parish Council agrees to the minor alterations to the specification. The Clerk was
    asked to obtain quotes for the work from Jeremy Simmons Ltd, Cotswold Estate Services, R.
    Gardiner, R. O. W. Berry and D. Chubb.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>NOTICEBOARD</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the noticeboard opposite the Post Office in Clarks Hay had
    been vandalised. Mrs S. Kingsbury had reported the incident to the police and was willing
    to act as a witness if the police decided to prosecute the perpetrators. PC93 Gwillym is
    the investigating officer. The Clerk had ascertained that the Parish Council was not
    insured against the damage. The Clerk was asked to obtain quotes for its repair from Mr
    Hungerford, R. O. W. Berry and A &amp; B Fencing.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the Parish Council that from February a concession will be
    granted to members of the public to speak at CDC Planning meetings for three minutes on
    applications which may be of concern to them. Cllr Gardiner had been asked by Mr Chris
    Francis of 37 Boxbush Road if the Parish Council had any objection to him laying tarmac,
    at his expense, to the start of the public right of way which exits the car park at the
    end of Boxbush Road. Mr Francis had contacted Phil Cluely GCC PROW officer and Derek
    Taylor GCC Highways both of whom had no objections. The Parish Council had no objections.<br>
    Cllr Harris queried if the Clerk had consulted with the UK BMX Society on the construction
    of the mound. The Clerk replied that he was reluctant to be involved in accepting
    instructions of a design nature and recommended that Whitton Associates would be more
    suited for this task. Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to liaise with Whitton Associates.<br>
    Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to enquire from James Thomas, Assistant Environmental Drainage
    Engineer if all necessary repairs had been carried out to the inspection covers and
    reopening others that had been covered over.<br>
    Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to enquire from Mr Grace, if the new wall at Orchard House had
    exceeded its permitted height.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that Cllr King should respond on its behalf to a consultation on
    the Glos Rural Strategy. The intention is to categorise priority for action into three
    sections: Immediate ­ where action can start quickly, may be of short duration and may be
    necessary as preparation for longer term action; Medium Term ­ where action will take
    longer to get started and can deliver defined benefits to the economy over a limited
    period, probably no more than 2-3 years; Longer Term ­ where action will take longer to
    set up, probably involving different partners and various funding streams but leading to a
    significant impact on the rural economy of Gloucestershire.<br>
    Cllr Harris had been contacted by Mr Pollard regarding excessive noise from jet skis using
    Lake 11 on the weekend of 29 December. Further jet ski races were advertised to take place
    on 26 January and another in March and the Clerk was asked to report this nuisance to Mr
    Grace, CDC Enforcement Officer.<p>There being no further business Cllr Mrs Gardiner closed
    the meeting at 9.32pm.</td>
