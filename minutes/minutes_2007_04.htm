 It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chubb and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Minutes, as 
 amended, were a true and accurate record. Cllr Caunce abstained as he had not 
 attended the meeting. The remainder of the Parish Councillors were all in 
 favour. Cllr Stuart then signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge gave this report. He informed Parish Councillors 
 that the group was attending instruction classes at CDC under the tutelage of 
 Claire Dowan on how to be more effective as a Youth Parish Council, its 
 organisation and roles. Discussions were also taking place on how the code 
 should be updated and when finalised the YPC would seek a meeting with the 
 Parish Council to explain the modifications. Due to organisational difficulties 
 the cyclothon had been postponed. On alternate months either Thomas Nicholas or 
 Joe Lodge would attend the Parish Council meeting to make a report. Joe Lodge 
 agreed that the YPC would be represented at the Annual Parish Meeting on 16th 
 May.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay was disappointed that Cllr Parsons (GCC) had not 
 responded to a question he raised on the entitlement for youth service 
 provision for the children of South Cerney and will reiterate his query at the 
 Annual Parish Meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart updated the meeting on the new bridge on the 
 canal tow path over the river Churn informing it that ramps would be installed 
 to allow access to cyclists, wheel chairs and perambulators.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported on a conversation he had with Dr P. 
 Stephenson who knew of a firm which undertook traffic design briefs for 
 villages. Cllr Jay asked the Parish Council to support the South Cerney Trust 
 to make an application for S.106 contributions for such a traffic engineering 
 scheme. It was hoped that with further support from the Cotswold District 
 Council and Gloucestershire County Council the outcome would be successful. It 
 was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council 
 supports the South Cerney Trust in its bid for this scheme. The Parish Council 
 was all in favour. <br>
 The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Smith who suggested that applications for 
 S.106 funding be discussed as an agenda item at next month’s meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a resident, the 15th Marquis de 
 Derval et de Moisdon, was concerned with the design of the traffic calming 
 scheme entering Clarks Hay from Silver Street. It was pointed out to Cllr 
 Harris that this was a notional plan and as stated in the Minutes page 2225 Mr 
 Midgeley Gloucestershire Highways Area Program Manager would ask for an 
 engineers’ report on a design for actuality of the Clarks Hay scheme. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired if any further action had been 
 forthcoming on the replacement of a tree to commemorate Jim Parker, a past 
 Chairman of the Parish Council. The Clerk would write to Mr Paul de Jong, 
 Environment Standards Manager to request that he expedite action to resolve the 
 matter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired if any further action had been 
 forthcoming on the alleged mis-use of a lodge on Lake 15 which was being used 
 as a sales office by a local estate agent. Cllr Bennett (CDC) would investigate 
 and report back to the Clerk. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired if any further action had been 
 forthcoming on adverts which had been appended to the chain link fence and 
 others which were free standing at the junction of Station Road and B4696 
 Eastern Spine Road. Cllr Bennett (CDC) would investigate and report back to the 
 Clerk.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 29th March I attended a lecture and workshop 
 at Chedworth Village Hall explaining which programs were necessary to create a 
 website. It was organised by GRCC and hosted by Melanie Tarrant ably assisted 
 by Roger Taylor, Creative Director of Montpellier Creative Visual 
 Communications of Cheltenham. Roger was attending as a member of ProFree which 
 is an umbrella organisation for professionals who wish to freely contribute 
 their expertise to help the community. The course lasted about two hours and 
 was very informative but unless Raymond Fenton wishes to retire I would 
 recommend that the Parish Council persists with his excellent management of the 
 website. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I would like to remind Parish Councillors that there will 
 not be any committee meetings next month (May) because of the forthcoming 
 elections. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Since this is the last occasion that the current Parish 
 Council will meet I would like to express my appreciation for the support and 
 trust that you have given me over the past four years, during which time I have 
 enjoyed working with all of you. I would like to congratulate all members for 
 their dedication, commitment and success in the many projects undertaken. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During March, of the 22 available working days, I averaged 
 31/4 hours per day which was marginally less than my contract allowed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 16th April. Cllr 
 Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris and Cllr Squire had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 On page 2226 the Committee agreed that the following outstanding matters had 
 been dealt with: Speed Limit Signs and the Blocked Grille on Station Road. Cllr 
 Squire had reminded Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire Area Highway 
 Representative that action was required on the overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow, 
 Advertising ‘A’ Boards on the Spine Road, the manhole cover in Station Road, 
 the damaged bus stop sign, the resurfacing of Ham Lane and the hoardings on the 
 south side of the cross roads at Station Road, Cerney Wick Lane and the Spine 
 Road.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that there was no issue to report at the play area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris also reported that there was nothing of note to report at the play 
 area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart who was not at the meeting on Monday then made his report. He had 
 noted that the basketball net stand upright had been slightly bent but was 
 still usable. The cycle mounds were in order and in regular use. Vandals had 
 broken off one tree and used it as fuel for a bonfire. Cllr Harris would remove 
 the remaining stump. Bottles were littering the area by the lake. One rail of 
 the fence surrounding the car park had been knocked out and needed to be 
 reinstated. Cllr Stuart had informed Mr R. Sollis (CDC) that fly tipping of 
 bricks, rubble and two exhaust pipes had occurred by the plastic recycling bin. 
 The Cricket Club pavilion had been further vandalised. More windows had been 
 smashed and new chips in the rendered walls were in evidence. Cllr Bennett 
 (CDC) would inform Les Haines (CDC). The graffiti had not been painted over. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PUBLIC SEAT AT ROBERT FRANKLIN WAY PLAY AREA</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that several residents in the vicinity of the play area 
 had complained that the seat at the western entrance encouraged gatherings of 
 youths who, at times, became raucous and boisterously disorderly. Cllr Harris 
 purported that the seat, as sited, was surplus to requirements and should be 
 moved to a site to be decided. It had been proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded 
 by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council considers relocating the seat to the 
 Upper Up playing field. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Parish Council it was proposed by Cllr Harris and 
 seconded by Cllr Webb to abide by the proposal of the Committee to relocate the 
 seat. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RESTRICTING THE USE OF ROBERT FRANKLIN WAY PLAY AREA</b>
 <br>
 Due to behavioural problems late at night at Robert Franklin Way play area Cllr 
 Harris had suggested that use of the area should be restricted. To enforce this 
 policy he asked that consideration is given to a sign being erected which 
 stated: “PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PLAY AREA AFTER 10pm. BY ORDER OF THE PARISH 
 COUNCIL”. It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the 
 Parish Council considers erecting two signs at the entrances to the play area 
 from Robert Franklin Way and Lakeside respectively. The Committee was all in 
 favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Parish Council it was proposed by Cllr Caunce and 
 seconded by Cllr Harris to abide by the proposal of the Committee to erect the 
 signs. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
