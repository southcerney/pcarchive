    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 9th MARCH 2005</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart 
    welcomed Hester Oxford, Gloucestershire County Council Area Partnership 
    Officer. Hester gave a brief description of her role in revising a charter 
    or memo of understanding between local authorities which had been in 
    existence since 1995. It was hoped that the charter might take the form of a 
    tripartite agreement between Gloucestershire County Council, District 
    Councils, and Town and Parish Councils. She then invited Parish Councillors 
    for their ideas of what they would like to see in any such charter. Cllr Jay 
    asked that replies or even acknowledgements to letters to the main 
    authorities be made within 5 days. Cllr Stuart would like to see the 
    Planning Authority at the District Council pay more attention to 
    recommendations of the Parish Planning Committee. There was a general 
    consensus that the Parish Council be consulted before action was taken 
    especially by those responsible for street lighting, highway matters and 
    public footpaths. When contact was made with such officers a good working 
    relationship was usually developed and this was to be encouraged. Ms Oxford 
    explained that progress would be slow on developing the charter because of 
    the number of consultations involved but she would keep the Parish Council 
    informed. The Chairman thanked her for attending and the regular meeting of 
    the Parish Council followed Ms Oxford’s departure.</p>

    the” to read: consider the<br>
    Page 1936: 2nd paragraph 2nd line – delete “let” insert: left<br>
    Page 1942: Delete 2nd paragraph and replace it with: Cllr Jay congratulated 
    Chairman Cllr M. Stuart on his auctioneering skills at a fund raising event 
    on behalf of the Tsunami Boat Appeal. The total amount now raised is in 
    excess of £14,000.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    in favour. Cllr Nicholas abstained as he did not attend the meeting. Cllr 
    Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Sudeley Drive</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that he, Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb had visited the site 
    near 35 Sudeley Drive and agreed that Mrs Newing had cause for concern about 
    activities behind the Thames Water pumping station. The Clerk was asked to 
    inform PCSO Yeoman and request that he liaises with Cllr Squire and Mrs 
    Newing.<br>
    <b>Area south of Meadow Way near South Cerney Farmhouse</b><br>
    Cllr Harris explained to Cllr Jay that the area had been included in the 
    specification as an item for tender.<br>
    <b>Thrift Cottage</b><br>
    Mr McEwen had objected to the tone and content of a letter the Clerk had 
    written regarding the parking of his visitors’ vehicles on public open space 
    outside his property. Cllr Nicholas advised that the language used should be 
    less contentious in future.<br>
    <b>Post Office Collection</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to write to Nigel Keates, Assistant Duty Office Manager 
    at Cirencester Post Office to request that the collection and delivery vans 
    desist from parking on the grass verge when servicing the mail box at the 
    Lennards/Station Road point.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Wednesday 16 February I attended a meeting with Cllr Stuart, Cllr Jay, 
    Cllr Mrs Pollard, Cllr Webb and Mel Tarrant of the GRCC to discuss how the 
    analysis of the information on the Village Plan that Cllr Mrs Pollard had 
    collated might be used. Good progress was made and a further meeting took 
    place on Monday 28 February to continue the discussion. At this meeting the 
    original group was augmented by Dr Peter Stephenson, Patrick Mills and 
    Steven Walker and the discussion on the draft plan continued. The next 
    meeting is scheduled to take place on Thursday 24 March. It is to be hoped 
    that a progress report will be presented to a full meeting of the Parish 
    Council at its next meeting in April. On Tuesday 22 February I joined Cllr 
    Jay at a roadshow on the Code of Conduct in the Council Chambers. Generally 
    I consider that the Parish Council is adhering to the Code, although in some 
    instances it does err on the side of caution when interests are declared. 
    For example, a Councillor can speak and vote if a personal interest is 
    declared but not if that interest is prejudicial, in which case s/he must 
    leave the room. James Ellis, Head of Legal Services at CDC will be leaving 
    his position at the end of March to be replaced by Bhavna Patel. During 
    February I averaged 4 hours 5 minutes each day over the 20 available working 
    days which is some 13.5% in excess of my contract.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>ZEBRA CROSSING</b><br>
    Chairman Cllr Stuart promoted an item in correspondence from Mr S. Beard who 
    was invited to state his concerns on the siting of the crossing. Mr Beard 
    said that flashing lights will be a nuisance to him if the crossing is put 
    outside his property. He further stated that since 1963 there had only been 
    one fatality and one frightened boy. If the crossing was for the benefit of 
    school children then the proportion of time when the crossing would be of 
    use would be minimal. Cllr Stuart informed Mr Beard that the Parish Council 
    had taken a democratic decision had voted in favour of the crossing and the 
    debate had been well publicised in the Minutes and the Cerney News. He 
    suggested that Mr Beard addressed his concerns directly to Mr Whittaker at 
    GCC Highways.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Development off Meadow Way</b><br>
    Chairman Cllr Stuart promoted this agenda item as a deputation from the 
    development was present. Representatives from the development spoke on 
    behalf of the residents that, as the development was known as The Secret 
    Garden on legal documents, it should be formally adopted. It was proposed by 
    Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Smith that the name The Secret Garden be 
    recommended to CDC as the preferred choice of the Parish Council. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Committee which had met on 
    Monday 7th March.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Highway Matters:</b><br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs</b><br>
    Cllr Squire informed the Committee that he had applied for a grant of £6,000 
    from the CDC to defray the cost of providing the signs.<br>
    <b>Footpath Widening</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart confirmed that the width of the footpath on the east side of 
    Silver Street in the vicinity of Berry’s Farm had been widened.<br>
    <b>Refurbishment of Upper Up car park</b><br>
    One verbal quote for £500 had been received from Mr M. Thompson to break up 
    surface of the car park with a digger bucket, scrape level and compact. It 
    was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Webb that if Mr Thompson 
    agreed in writing to the specification then the Parish Council should accept 
    his quotation. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that excepting ongoing deterioration of the rubber 
    coating on the swing seats and vandalism to the basketball net, all the 
    other equipment was satisfactory. He suggested that the basketball net 
    should be removed. The plastic recycling skip is now installed on the car 
    park. The growth on the gravelled path across the area needs spraying. 
    Regular visits by the PCSO after dark has reduced noise and misbehaviour.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in working order. The lamination 
    of one panel on the adventure unit in the toddlers play area was peeling. 
    Cllr Harris agreed to remove the damaged panel. The ring part of the latch 
    on the gate to the Toddlers Play Area was missing but works satisfactorily. 
    Cllr Mrs Chubb volunteered to carry out the inspections in Cllr Harris’ 
    absence.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order.<br>
    <br>
    <b>QUOTATIONS</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a competing contractor and 
    left the room.<br>
    The Finance Committee had agreed with the recommendations of the Playing 
    Field and Village Maintenance Committee that the following quotations, being 
    the lowest submitted, are accepted. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded 
    by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council accepts the following quotations: (a) 
    Lee Ponting – Quotation for Tree planting in Clarks Hay as per specification 
    – £454.00 (no VAT); (b) James Harris Contracting – Quotation for work on 
    trees, hedges and shrubs as per specification – £375 (ex VAT); <br>
    (c) Tree Maintenance Ltd – Quotation for shrub cover clearance at Robert 
    Franklin Way playing field as per specification – £126.00 (ex VAT). The 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to write to Tim Pain, Chief Executive of the Water Park 
    Society to encourage him to work with the Parish Council to lobby those 
    responsible to clean up the cycleway and footpath on the Spine Road and 
    reinstate the verges.<br>
    Cllr Squire asked the Clerk to write to the occupants of 1 Sudeley Drive 
    requesting that they cut back their hedge which was overgrowing the 
    pavement.<br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report that tree roots were growing through 
    the path from Bow Wow to Box Bush beyond the new bridge. The Clerk will 
    contact GCC Highways.<br>

    <b>CT.5788/X</b><br>
    Provision of external kitchen extraction ductwork at South Cerney Tandoori, 
    7 The Laurels, Clarks Hay, South Cerney<br>
    Reason 1 is of particular interest. The property lies within the South 
    Cerney Conservation Area, wherein the Local Planning Authority must pay 
    special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the 
    character or appearance of the locality. The proposed extraction flue by 
    virtue of its industrial design, size, scale, positioning and use of modern 
    construction materials would be harmful and would fail to either preserve or 
    enhance the character or appearance of the conservation area. As such the 
    proposal is contrary to Policies 1, 29 and 40 of the Cotswold District Local 
    Plan, Policy NHE6 of the Gloucestershire Structure Plan Second Review and 
    Government guidance contained in PPS1 (Delivering Sustainable Development) 
    and PPG15 (Planning and the Historic Environment).<br>
    <br>
    <b>CONDITION OF SPINE ROAD</b><br>
    Vigorous debate ensued on the continuing muddy state of the B4696 Spine 
    Road. Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Parsons (GCC) had differing opinions as to 
    who was responsible for which aspect of cleaning the road. There is 
    confusion whether mud should be classed as litter and which authority is 
    responsible for its removal. The situation is further complicated as parts 
    of the road run across county boundaries. Cllr Parsons (GCC) will try to get 
    one person to act as a supremo to oversee the cleaning but this will take 
    time and delicate negotiation. In the meantime the Clerk was asked to write 
    to Mrs Girling (Leader of CDC) and the Health and Safety Executive in an 
    effort to determine who is responsible and point out that the situation will 
    be the cause of a serious accident if action is not taken.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE PLAN</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard agreed with the Clerk’s assessment regarding the progress 
    of the plan. A further meeting is planned for Thursday 24th March.<br>
