 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the Minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No representative from the Youth Parish Council attended 
 the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO MIKE OWEN INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart welcomed PCSO Mike Owen to the meeting who 
 then introduced himself to the Parish Council as the latest recruit to patrol 
 in South Cerney and Cerney Wick. It is his intention to be proactive within the 
 community, explaining that PCSO coverage would be from 8am until 10pm daily. He 
 replied affirmatively to a query from Cllr Harris on the availability of 
 transport. Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had attended with the Clerk at 
 CDC regarding the introduction of new traffic assistants who would take over 
 the enforcement of parking in designated areas throughout the district from 
 Monday 5th November. PCSO Owen then left the meeting to continue his patrol. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb enquired why the Clerk had not written to GCC 
 Highways about the state of Broadway Lane. The Clerk explained that two letters 
 had been received from the authority explaining in detail the problems it was 
 experiencing in the aftermath of the flood crisis earlier in the year and the 
 reasons would only be reiterated if such a query was repeated. Nevertheless, it 
 was agreed that the state of the carriageway should be highlighted and the 
 authority asked to inform the Parish Council when it intended to carry out 
 resurfacing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris enquired from Cllr Mrs Aram (CDC) if she had 
 anything further to report on the erection of holiday homes. The Clerk 
 interrupted and informed Cllr Harris that Cllr Mrs Aram (CDC) had emailed a 
 report of her findings which he had broadcast to all Parish Councillors on 
 email. Cllr Harris explained that he had problems with his email service and 
 was not aware of the information. Cllr Mrs Aram (CDC) continued, since then the 
 Environment Agency had informed CDC that it had no objection to the development 
 on Lake 17.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 18th September Jan Wildman delivered the speed gun and 
 explained its operation and rules of use. I delivered the kit to Cllr Stuart 
 and informed all those Councillors on email that he was asking for volunteers 
 to use the gun. The equipment was recovered on Monday 1st October and returned 
 to Mrs Wildman. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 27th September I attended the AGM of the 
 county branch of the SLCC in Wotton under Edge. Stephen Wright, now Chairman of 
 the Gloucestershire Quality Parish Accreditation Panel was the main speaker. He 
 argued the case for parish and town councils achieving “quality status” 
 primarily because the political map was changing from three tier local 
 government to two as evidenced by what has happened in Wiltshire. He was 
 convinced that more services would be devolved to the parish and town councils 
 when this change became effective. Of the 14 clerks who attended the meeting 
 out of a total of 96 in the county only one was currently endeavouring to 
 achieve quality status. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 28th September I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a 
 meeting with Geoffrey Clifton- Brown MP, Cllr Shaun Parsons (GCC), Chris 
 Franklin Area Stakeholder Manager, Andrew Parker-Mowbray Team Leader Accident 
 Investigation &amp; Prevention and Terry Gibson Development Control, all 
 representing Gloucestershire Highways, Sean Hodgson and another from Waters 
 Edge development, Mike Hindley and Ron Jefferies from Cerney Wick to discuss 
 how to make using the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Station Road and Spine Road 
 less dangerous. The solution to lower the speed limit was favoured as traffic 
 lights would not be installed prior to 2011 and a roundabout would be expensive 
 although neither scheme was totally discounted. Chris Franklin will conduct a 
 traffic survey and report back to the group sometime in early spring of 2008. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 3rd October I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a 
 meeting at CDC, Trinity Road where the new enforcement of parking regulations 
 throughout the district was explained. District Councils in conjunction with 
 the County Council will manage the scheme instead of the Police. Revenue, 
 beyond what was needed to recoup costs, would be ring-fenced for use in 
 enhancing motorists’ facilities. It was not the intention to be overly 
 aggressive in the implementation of the scheme and a six-month period was 
 envisaged to let it bed down from its start date on November 5th. One of the 
 presenters said that it was the ambition to issue “quality” tickets. Cllr 
 Stuart asked if any of the income would be available for South Cerney but was 
 dismayed to learn that only communities contributing would be eligible. I 
 enquired if the scheme was to be incentive driven but was reassured that it 
 would not. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 4th October I attended the Lighting Forum in 
 the Village Hall along with Cllr Stuart, Cllr Jay and Cllr Webb. Barry 
 Greenaway GCC Street Lighting Manager and Lesley Smith from Street Lighting 
 also attended. Overall 14 residents came to inspect and comment on the plan 5 
 of whom were against any reduction which represented 65 per cent in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 5th October Cllr Webb and myself attended an 
 early morning function at the Four Pillars Hotel which gave a report on the 
 plan for the future of the Cotswold Water Park. Martin Orme, General Manager of 
 the hotel promoted the facilities and function of the hotel, a director the 
 Cooperative Society explained how it behaves as a major land owner within the 
 area and a member of the consultants currently working on the plan gave an 
 overall view of its objectives. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During September, of the 20 available working days, I 
 averaged 3 hours 55 minutes per day which is about 10% more than my contract 
 allows.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th OCTOBER
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart, Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker attended the meeting which Cllr 
 Caunce opened at 7pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Replacement Curfew Restriction Sign</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the replacement sign had been installed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VAS Station Road <br>
 </b>Cllr Caunce reported that the vehicle sign in Station Road was now 
 operating correctly. In future if it was necessary to report the equipment as 
 faulty the Clerk had been advised to telephone George Surman on 01452 583542 or 
 email <a href="mailto:george.surman@gloucestershire.gov.uk">
 george.surman@gloucestershire.gov.uk</a> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clerk’s Report; Review of Recent Floods; Flood 
 Prevention</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that he had seen a surveyor’s report on drainage in Bow 
 Wow which ostensibly had no significant effect on the recent floods in that 
 area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Compensatory Wish List</b> <br>
 The Clerk had contacted Stuart Milsom (Parish Council agent) who informed him 
 that Thames Water was currently undertaking some research and costings and 
 therefore he can’t do much more until it has formally responded. He has made it 
 clear to Peter Mitchell agent representing Thames Water that we need to agree 
 any works in kind as soon as possible, not least because much of the equipment 
 required to undertake these works is already on site. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that no quotes had been received and advised that the Parish 
 Council should consider requesting Gloucestershire Highways, who were 
 ultimately responsible for its maintenance, of the problems encountered due to 
 new legislation in securing a contractor to carry out the dredging work. The 
 Committee was in favour and asked the Clerk to copy the correspondence to Cllr 
 S. Parsons (GCC). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to enquire from Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways if 
 there were any developments to report on his meeting with the Environment 
 Agency. Mr Franklin had informed the Clerk that a meeting had been arranged for 
 10th October but through illness of a member of the Environment Agency the 
 meeting had to be postponed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Bike Ramps</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had been in contact with Julie Tegg, Gloucestershire Playing Fields 
 Association who will advise on further action at a later date.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the 360 degree swing will remain out of action until 
 the replacement base plate is delivered. The missing brackets reported in the 
 previous month’s report had been replaced.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that with the exception of the Cycle Mounds all play 
 equipment was serviceable. The Fenplay safety surfaces which were awaiting 
 repair had been completed and the sand delivered to Rose Cottage. Cllr Stuart 
 would ask Mr Curtis if he would help to spread it over the safety area. The 
 Cycle Mounds are unusable due to civil engineering works. The recently 
 installed seat on the mounds has been vandalised and needs to be repaired. It 
 was decided to redesign the seat and create a bench instead. Cllr Harris 
 reported that he had removed most of the back rest on the bench since the 
 Monday evening meeting. Considerable rubbish is being left in the vicinity of 
 the recycling bins and Cllr Stuart has requested CDC to arrange a regular 
 cleaning exercise. It was agreed to recommend that the Finance Committee 
 sanction an extra payment to Mr Curtis for his efforts in taking the fireman’s 
 pole to and from the welder in Broadway Lane for repair.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that two rails on the seat were broken and needed to be 
 replaced. It was undecided whether or not to replace the seat with a new one. 
 Cllr Caunce will inspect the base of the seat and report his findings to the 
 Parish Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SPEED GUN REPORT <br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Nicholas checked traffic speeds on the evening 
 of Friday 21st September. It was believed that due to their conspicuous 
 florescent waistcoats vigilant motorists curtailed their speed through the 
 surveillance area and the results were not representative of normal behaviour. 
 On Saturday 29th September Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and PCSO Pooley carried out a 
 further operation with similar results. Some motorists were guilty of abusing 
 the limit and would be notified but not prosecuted. Overall Cllr Mrs Tunbridge 
 said that it was a useful exercise. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FLOOD RECOVERY CORRESPONDENCE</b> <br>
 In reply to a query from Mrs Claire Locke (Ride) CDC Emergency Planning, 
 Licensing &amp; Private Sector Housing Manager regarding flooding events in the 
 Parish it was agreed to advise her that: i) sewage contaminated surface water 
 in Clarks Hay; ii) river flooding affected No.1 School Lane and surface water 
 flooded the cellar of Century House, Silver Street; iii) residential streets 
 affected were Silver Street, Clarks Hay, School Lane and north end of Cerney 
 Wick; iv) No community assets were affected. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>STATION ROAD BUS SHELTER PROPOSAL</b> <br>
 The Committee was of the opinion that there was a requirement to install a bus 
 shelter on the north side of Station Road in the vicinity of South Cerney House 
 and the entrance to the Lennards to provide a facility for bus passengers from 
 nearby dwellings. Cllr Mrs Chubb volunteered to enquire from GCC on available 
 grants and designs of bus shelters. If a plan could be formatted the scheme 
 might be considered for finance from next year’s budget.Cllr Mrs Chubb had been 
 told by GCC that there was no money available as it had been used for flood 
 relief but to apply in the next financial year. Cllr Jay asked that residents 
 in the vicinity of the proposed shelter should be consulted about the 
 installation before a final decision is made to go ahead.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris queried if the small wooden bridge 
 construction crossing the stream which in turn flows under the large brick 
 bridge carrying the road going from Bow Wow to Sisters Farm is to be repaired. 
 Cllr Stuart replied that in the past Mike Mould from Lower Mill had maintained 
 it but recently the Parish Council had asked GCC PROW to accept that it owns 
 the land and to take on responsibility for all future repairs. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had contacted Jim Sokol from the Environment 
 Agency about the unkempt state of the small stream which flowed through 
 Franklin’s field between the old railway line and Crane Farm in Bow Wow. Mr 
 Sokol could not force action on the owner but would advise him of the potential 
 hazard. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that Mr Fisher had asked to be 
 reimbursed as the oak tree planted on his behalf at Upper Up had failed. Cllr 
 Harris considered that the tree was stressed and Cllr Stuart agreed that it was 
 not dead but should show recovery in its next year of growth. Cllr Harris will 
 inform Mr Fisher.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas referred the Committee to his report on the 
 Flood Forum which he had emailed to Parish Councillors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had attended a workshop on the Master Plan 
 Process for the Cotswold Water Park on 26th September at the Gateway Centre. He 
 considered it would an advantage if a dialogue could be established with Scott 
 Wilson in order to involve the Parish Council in the future plans of the 
 Cotswold Water Park. It would also be useful to liaise with Somerford Keynes 
 who had similar concerns.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reminded Parish Councillors to prepare any 
 bids they might have for the precept budget meeting which will convene in 
 January 2008. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8:35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th
 OCTOBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8:35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent his apology for absence as he was otherwise engaged. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 The Clerk replied in the negative to a query from Cllr Jay if Bloor Homes had 
 been in contact since the last meeting. There had been no reply from Mr 
 Franklin regarding a request for a quote to dredge the open ditch in Station 
 Road. Mary Mychaleckyj, GCC Youth Worker had been in contact although there was 
 no finance element in her communication.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 8th
 OCTOBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the full Council Meeting, Cllr Webb gave the report as 
 Cllr Nicholas had sent his apology for absence. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb had attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas had opened the meeting at 9:00pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent his apology for absence as he was otherwise engaged.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 The Clerk was to inform Dr A. Pellegram (CDC) that a response was awaited to 
 the issues raised at a recent meeting with Parish Councillors and to inform her 
 how useful they found the discussions.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications Received by Cotswold District
 Council</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.1454/4/N </b>Applicant: Ms Alison Russell, The 
 Willows, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney<br>
 Replacement of a temporary mobile home with a new building incorporating (a) a 
 three bedroom keyworker with (b) office space for the fishery and fish farm at 
 The Willows, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney <br>
 A new dwelling in this isolated location is unacceptable and would have a 
 detrimental impact on the environment. The nature of the design is patently not 
 for a “key worker”. There is no genuine need for a dwelling on the site. It 
 would be very undesirable to have an individual primary residential dwelling on 
 this or other lakes in the Water Park. Whilst undoubtedly a high quality 
 contemporary design, it would be very conspicuous in this rural location. <br>
 OBJECTION <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council 
 accepts the deliberation of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the 
 following three applications as the applicant was a client and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.0006/4/Q</b> Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, 
 The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Alterations to lodge design for plot 46 including provision of a boathouse at 
 Lake 16, Cotswold Water Park, Broadway Lane, South Cerney <br>
 It would compromise the uniformity of the design of the development. As with 
 the other such second home developments, a clear pattern of design is vital to 
 the character and overall appearance.<br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/Y</b> Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, 
 The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Amendment to previously approved scheme of holiday lodges for Plots 23-30 only 
 at Lake 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney <br>
 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/Z</b> Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, 
 The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Amendment to previously approved scheme of holiday lodges for Plots 18-22 and 
 32 at Lake 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney <br>
 NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Land that the Parish Council accepts the deliberations of the Planning 
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Application Refused by Cotswold District 
 Council</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.1498/C</b> <br>
 Proposed new dwelling at The Ridges, Station Road, South Cerney <br>
 Conditions of note: 1. The proposal would result in development which would be 
 out of scale and character with the adjoining dwelling, on a severely 
 restricted plot, and would adversely affect the residential amenities of 
 existing and future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 
 18(c) and 46 of the Cotswold District Local Plan and national guidance in PPS1. 
 2. The proposed development does not incorporate sufficient vehicle parking and 
 turning facilities for the proposed development or the new dwelling to enable a 
 vehicle to enter and leave the site in forward gear at all times with the 
 result that vehicles would be likely to reverse to or from the county highway, 
 contrary to the interests of highway safety.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications Withdrawn</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.5102/E</b> <br>
 Conversion and extension of existing garage to form a dwelling. Erection of 
 garage to serve Langet End, Upper Up, South Cerney </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9:27pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SEVERN &amp; THAMES CANAL</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from the 
 Chairman that this item be carried over to next month’s agenda as Cllr 
 Messenger (CDC) who had requested the debate had given his apology for absence 
 due to a car accident. Cllr Bennett (CDC) said in order to avoid confusion this 
 scheme was a “pet project” of Cllr Messenger’s and not necessarily CDC policy. 
 Cllr Caunce stated in his opinion there was nothing further to discuss and the 
 matter should be brought to a close. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and 
 seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agreed to postpone the debate and 
 that the item is formed as a resolution on the agenda for November. Eight 
 Parish Councillors were in favour and 1 against. The motion was therefore 
 carried.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>LIGHTING PLAN FOR SOUTH CERNEY</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The target set by GCC was to reduce CO2 emisisons by 10% 
 by 2012 and street lighting presently accounts for 8,800 tonnes which costs 
 £1.8m. Part night lighting will reduce operating hours and annual costs by 
 approx 40% per annum for each converted street light. Throughout the county 161 
 town and parish councils have been invited to particpate in the project. The 
 plan displayed is a coarse proposal as the team had to deal with almost 70 
 applications from local councils in the past few weeks and it was not possible 
 to carry out site surveys. Parish Councillors are invited to change the coarse 
 proposals using their knowledge of local situations and needs. The police will 
 be invited to comment on the final draft proposal. The plan in South Cerney is 
 to convert 80 lights to part night operation which is 32%, giving a reduction 
 in CO2 emisisons of 3.94 tonnes and £763 per year. The work will take no more 
 than 3 days and a small yellow marker will be banded onto the support column or 
 post to denote a part night street light. The sensor/timing device will need 
 about 3 nights to “acclimatise” to the time of year. Accuracy is within 15 
 minutes and the device adjusts for the changeover from GMT to BST. Once 
 operational, if the Parish Council wishes to alter the plan, GCC will give this 
 urgent attention. Arrangements are in hand to monitor the monthly before and 
 after road traffic accidents and crime figures for each local council 
 participating in the project.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb was concerned with the potential delay to the 
 sewerage works if the scheme was to be stymied by the refusal of a land owner 
 to agree a value with Thames Water thereby forcing a compulsory purchase order 
 which could take years before fruition. The Parish Council agreed that Geoffrey 
 Clifton-Brown MP should be made aware of the situtation to see if he could 
 expedite a resolution.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that the South Cerney Trust had taken 
 out membership of the Open Spaces Society so that it can call on its expertise 
 when required. In the same way the Trust has been a member of the 
 Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust for years it had joined forces with the Open 
 Spaces Society. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reported that Lady Fanshawe was 
 concerned with the security of her swimming pool. Cllr Stuart informed her that 
 the police were monitoring the situation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to inform the owners of 
 the field opposite the home of Mrs D. Rimes in Cerney Wick to cut back their 
 hedge as it was inconveniencing road users. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to enquire from Roger 
 Sollis about the cost of installing a dog bin and where it might be sourced. 
 The Parish Council agreed that it is treated as an agenda item at next month’s 
 meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb complained that persons were removing 
 stones from the wall in Station Road. Cllr Stuart advised her to report the 
 incident to the police. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land reported that residents of the flats in 
 Berkeley Close complained that those living in Winchcombe Gardens were using 
 their parking spaces. Cllr Stuart suggested that she contact Fosseway Housing 
 regarding car parking on its land and PCSO Lesley Pooley or PCSO Mike Owen on 
 illegal parking in the Keep Clear space. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce will liaise with Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb to 
 complete the agreed seat survey. The Clerk had provided a copy of the street 
 lighting plan to help them with their audit. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that Mel Tarrant (GRCC) 
 was leaving that organisation to take up a post with Shelter in London. Mel, he 
 continued, had provided excellent help to the Parish, especially in the 
 construction of its local plan. The Parish Council agreed that a letter of 
 appreciation should be sent to her. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS CONTRIBUTIONS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">An item to explain the removal of the damaged concrete 
 seat at the junction of the Lennards and Station Road due to safety concerns 
 and the possibility of replacing it with a bus shelter. Instructions to those 
 using the recycling containers on the Upper Up car park not to leave uncyclable 
 material in the vicinity of the bins. The cardboard collection scheme was 
 proving a big success and arrangements had been made for the skip to be emptied 
 once a week. Drivers who had been caught exceeding the speed limit by the 
 recent exercise would be notified of their misconduct by the police but not 
 prosecuted. </p>
