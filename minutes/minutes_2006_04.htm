  The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart welcomed Claire Dowan,
  CDC Youth Participation Officer and Les Haines, CDC Community Support Officer to the
  meeting. Two members of the Press were present. Ms Dowan explained the aims and
  objectives of the Youth Parish Council (YPC) which in general will mirror the existing
  Parish Council although tailored to suit the aspirations of the youth of the village. As South
  Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council is considered a very proactive council it was
  chosen as the pilot scheme for this new venture. After discussion it was agreed that it would
  be helpful if the YPC was to meet, on its preferred day Tuesday, two weeks before the Parish
  Council so that its proposals could be considered properly and to avoid delay in the decision
  making process. Cllr Jay suggested that if members were agreeable a “goldfish bowl”
  arrangement might be implemented. He explained that this would entail YPC members
  shadowing Councillors during a meeting or part of one to gain experience on how such
  meetings operated. It was very necessary that interest was maintained and any development
  supported by the Parish Council. Claire Dowan explained that Criminal Record Bureau
  clearance was not required in dealing with the youths if best practice was always observed
  which would mean that two adults must be present when meetings with the YPC took place.
  An unconditional grant of £400 from the CDC is available and Les Haines alluded to further
  money from the High Sheriff’s grant fund. Parish Councillors agreed with Cllr Stuart when
  he suggested that a sub-committee be formed to oversee the venture. Cllr Jay, Cllr Caunce
  and Cllr Harris volunteered to serve on the committee. Cllr Stuart summed up the discussion
  and stated that the Parish Council totally supported the formation of the YPC and thanked
Claire Dowan for all her efforts. The meeting closed at 7.40pm. <br>

 The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.40pm.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DR MICHAEL BRIDE</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart paid tribute to Dr Bride past Chairman of the 
 Parish Council who had recently passed away. He said that he was a man of great 
 integrity and knowledge and would be missed by all those who had known him. The 
 assembled Parish Councillors and members of the press then held a short silence 
 in memory of Michael.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 24th March I attended a meeting of the SLCC at 
 Churchdown Community Centre which started at 10am. The morning session was 
 devoted to planning matters explained by A. R. Jones former Head of Planning at 
 CDC. After lunch the group concentrated on matters affecting Clerks’ 
 gratuities, salaries, completion of accounts for audit and other general 
 topics. The meeting closed at 3.15pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 28th March I accompanied Cllr Stuart and Cllr 
 Jay to a meeting of the Youth Parish Council (YPC) in the Village Hall at 
 6.30pm. Also present were Claire Dowan (CDC Youth Participation Officer), Dan 
 Mills, Thomas Nicholas, Rachael King, Joe Lodge, Rebecca Lodge, Michael Brown 
 and Dom Brown. Claire Dowan welcomed the group for this third meeting and 
 informed it that she also overlooks two other youth participation groups in 
 other parts of the Cotswold District. The YPC would be different insomuch that 
 it would concentrate on local issues pertaining to youth aspirations in the 
 village. Joe Lodge explained to the new members the aims and objectives of the 
 proposed YPC. Claire Dowan asked for a show of hands to determine whether the 
 group wished to continue and create a YPC. Everyone was in favour. Cllr Stuart 
 confirmed that the Parish Council welcomes the formation of the YPC and 
 explained his function as Chairman of the Parish Council. Cllr Jay and myself 
 then gave short synopses on our roles within the Parish Council. Older members 
 of the meeting were then asked to leave the room while the YPC debated its 
 formation and structure. The title of Bossy Person which will be given to the 
 leader was most original. The next meeting of the YPC would be held at CDC 
 offices on Thursday 20th April. Claire Dowan invited members to attend a 
 function ‘Celebrating Youth Participation’ at CDC offices on 28th April from 
 11am to 1.30pm. Cllr Stuart and the Clerk will attend.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 5th April Cllr Stuart and myself attended the 
 launch of the Gloucestershire Charter at Shire Hall in Gloucester. Peter 
 Bungard, GCC Chief Executive explained the purpose of the Charter, followed by 
 Richard Bellis, GAPTC County Secretary. The new structure of GCC Highways was 
 explained in some detail by Mark Dauncey the Network Manager. Finally, Dave 
 Hall, Chairman of Up Hatherley Parish Council spoke on how he expected the new 
 arrangement would benefit Parish Councils. After the meeting Cllr Stuart raised 
 the problems South Cerney Parish Council were experiencing with current highway 
 projects directly with Mark Dauncey.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">May I remind all Parish Councillors that the next meeting 
 of the Parish Council on the 10th May will be the Annual Meeting. This meeting 
 will elect/re-elect a Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Parish Council and 
 appoint Committees. Any Parish Councillor who will not be in attendance at the 
 Annual Meeting of the Parish Council should notify me in advance if s/he wishes 
 to serve on a particular Committee. The Annual Parish Council Meeting or APM 
 will take place on the 17th May.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During March over the 23 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours 20 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cutts Charity Vacancy</b><br>
 Cllr Jay stated that due to the death of Dr Bride a vacancy has occurred as 
 Trustee to the Cutts Charity. The Clerk was asked to include an item on next 
 month’s agenda to appoint a replacement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Flood Forum<br>
 </b>Cllr Nicholas reported on a Flood Forum meeting he had attended. Three 
 separate items dominated the discussion: 1. Malodorous stench in and around 
 Kingfisher Place; 2. Burst rising main and the installation of new soft start 
 pumps; 3. Detection of ground water infiltration into the gravity fed sewage 
 system. Overall he was convinced that Thames Water was eventually taking the 
 problem seriously and was committed to a time scale to complete the 
 refurbishment of the system. Flood Warden Under the terms of the 
 Gloucestershire Charter Cllr Nicholas agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Stuart 
 that he acts as Parish Council Flood Warden.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO<br>
 </b>The Clerk reported that no reply had been received from Inspector Williams, 
 Gloucestershire Constabulary to his queries regarding the frequency of visits 
 from the PCSO. The Clerk was instructed to copy the letter to his superior, 
 Chief Superintendent John Henry for an explanation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Village Plan<br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Pollard had been approached by Ian Nelson and Cllr Jay by Dr P. 
 Stephenson who confided that they were unsure of their roles in implementing a 
 commitment to promote “healthier routes to school”. Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr 
 Jay had been able to assuage their fears.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Highway Matters<br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart explained the new structures of the county highway department 
 which in future will be known as Gloucestershire Highways under the leadership 
 of Mark Dauncey, Highways Maintenance Manager. Mr John Whittaker is no longer 
 in post and a replacement is to be appointed. The Clerk was asked to write to 
 Mr Dauncey to remind him that a reply was sought regarding the three points 
 raised by Cllr Stuart when they met at the launch of the Gloucestershire 
 Charter.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Litter at Old George<br>
 </b>Although the new landlords at the Old George acknowledged that rubbish had 
 been left on the river bank and adjoining field they had pointed out that the 
 cans involved did not originate from their premises as they only sold bottles. 
 The Clerk was asked to remind them to clear away the other debris from the 
 river bank.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Parish Council Finance<br>
 </b>The organisation of the finances of the YPC was discussed and Parish 
 Councillors agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Caunce that the basis of 
 expenditure should be governed by the premise that it was “for fair and 
 reasonable usage”. The Clerk was instructed to make plans to create a No.2 
 Account to handle the affairs of the YPC based on the criteria which controlled 
 the accounts of the Parish Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Parish Council Insurance<br>
 </b>The Clerk was to enquire from Allianz Cornhill as to the status of the 
 members of the YPC.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the surrounds of the Senior Swing needs extra soil. 
 The cycle mounds are in constant use. An old mattress and tin sheets have been 
 picked up as requested and left for collection. New trees have been planted and 
 staked with long poles and ties as contracted. The new hedge plants are in the 
 ground and being watered by volunteers. The grass has been cut recently and is 
 looking good. A pile of debris needs collecting and taking to landfill. Cllr 
 Harris agreed to a suggestion that he would be willing to use his transport to 
 move the rubbish. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce that 
 the Parish Council pay all reasonable expenses including the tipping charge.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area <br>

 enter the Bledisloe Cup competition this year. The Parish Council was all in 
 favour. The Clerk had produced a guide map highlighting areas within the 
 village of note for the team to inspect. A covering letter will accompany the 
 application describing recent achievements. Cllr Stuart asked that the Clerk 
 informs the organisers that it would be appropriate in future if a permanent 
 plaque was issued to the winners of the Bledisloe Plate.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee was in agreement with Cllr Harris who 
 suggested that the Cricket Club should be asked to paint the outside of its 
 pavilion as its decoration was looking tired. The Clerk will write to Mike 
 James, Secretary of the SCCC.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Tree Wardens noted that the lime trees in Silver 
 Street needed to be cut back. To achieve a best result this work should be done 
 before budding. Cllr Harris suggested that the job could be carried out for 
 £150. Contractors would be asked to quote for the work with a deadline of 22nd 
 April for replies. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas 
 that the Parish Council agrees to accept the lowest quotation received by that 
 date.</p>

 and likely to cause flooding if left unattended. Similarly the grill opposite 
 the entrance to Huxley Court is also blocked. The Clerk was asked to report the 
 situation to the Environment Agency.</p>

 commenced by congratulating Cllr Smith on the proficiency of his multiplication 
 which alluded to the recent addition of a daughter to the family of David and 
 Sarah.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>2nd Homes Grant Application<br>
 </b>Cllr Squire informed the Committee that the bid for funding the MUGA 
 installation was unsuccessful as the Cabinet at CDC had decided to exclude

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS REPORTS<br>
 </b>Cllr Squire reported that the window in the west end of the church needed 
 restoration and he emphasised that he would not be requesting a grant at this 
 time from the Monument fund of the Parish Council. Funds, presently being 
 sought through other schemes, might be handled on a similar basis to those 
 donated for the refurbishment of the War Memorial. Cllr Squire requested that 
 the Committee considers recommending to the Parish Council that it agrees to 
 act as collection agent for the project which he will organise. The Committee 
 was in agreement. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the Parish Council agrees with the recommendation of the Finance 
 Committee. The Parish Council was in agreement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk explained that after the inaugural formation of 
 the Youth Parish Council (YPC), Claire Dowan, Youth Participation Officer (CDC) 
 had offered, unconditionally, to grant it £400. Cllr Stuart who had attended 
 the meeting asked in order to encourage the YPC, the Finance Committee 
 recommends to the Parish Council that it matches the grant to the YPC from CDC. 
 The Committee was in agreement. It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by 
 Cllr Jay that the Parish Council matches the proposed grant by the CDC and 
 allocate the payment from the Village Plan budget. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the 
 Planning Committee which had met on Monday 10th April.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to continue his enquiries with Michael 
 Grace, Enforcement Officer at CDC as what action if any had been taken 
 regarding the unauthorised advertisements at The Eliot Arms, Clarks Hay. In 
 particular he should point out that the trampoline advertisement known as “Room 
 at the Inn” and the five (5) spot lights which illuminate the building were not 
 included in any application and should therefore be removed. The Clerk was to 
 ask Mr Grace to confer with Cllr Webb.</p>

 Cerney Construction of a motel with car park (revised scheme) on land at Lake 
 7, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney (R)<br>
 This proposal would fundamentally change the character of this rural location 
 as viewed from the adjoining footpaths. The Parish Council is concerned as to 
 the precise appearance of the planned building as there were no details 
 describing the roof colour to be used. If permission was granted then the 
 development of the site should be put on hold until the sewage problem 
 affecting South Cerney has been resolved. Conditions requested if permission is 
 granted as follows: 1. A wheel wash to be mandatory for all vehicles exiting 
 the site during construction phases. 2. A dedicated lane is installed to allow 
 traffic accessing the completed site to turn right. 3. A reduction in the 
 current speed limit to 40 mph in the adjoining area be imposed.<br>

 </b>Applicant: R. Mackenzie-Hill, Watermark, Isis Lake, South Cerney 
 Advertisement consent for two (2) non-illuminated signs at Lake 11, Spine Road, 
 South Cerney<br>
 As this proposal involves the display of two (2) advertisement boards within 
 this open countryside location making a total of three (3) such advertisements 
 along this frontage, the proliferation of advertisement materials is considered 
 to be detrimental to the visual amenities of the locality and would set an 
 undesirable precedent that the Local Planning Authority would find difficult to 
 resist. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 31 of the Cotswold 
 District Local Plan, Policy 48 of the Cotswold District Revised Deposit and 
 Government guidance contained in PPG19 (Outdoor Advertisement Control) and the 
 provisions of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) 
 Regulations 1992.<br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb reported on a meeting of the Cotswold Water Park 
 Joint Committee he attended. Cllr Webb was scathing in his description of the 
 inaction of the Water Park organisation. The most popular excuse for not 
 complying with its obligations was lack of money and this was even used to 
 justify not carrying out health and safety checks except on one site. Cllr Webb 
 stated that this state of affairs will not do. It seemed to Cllr Webb that of 
 the five (5) authorities involved in the Joint Committee there was no one 
 capable of exercising control. He was frustrated to discover that results are 
 not published and very little detail about the operation of the CWP is 
 available. He concluded that the organisation is in a mess and strongly 
 suspects mismanagement. Cllr Webb will email the Clerk with a list of questions 
 he would like answered.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Pollard reported on a visit to Hawkesbury Upton 
 Parish Council which represented a population of about 1,500. Cllr Stuart had

 so who attended. There were forty seven persons on the steering committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, on behalf of the South Cerney Trust, expressed 
 disgust at the dog mess around Upper Up. He was critical of Thames Water in its 
 promulgation of the hose pipe ban. He said that in this day of abundant junk 
 mail it should be possible for the water company to inform customers 
 individually and not to rely on public news broadcasts to convey their message. 
 He wished to thank Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) for his support with regard to 
 flooding problems. He further reported that he had received his senior 
 citizen’s bus pass from CDC and would willingly inform those residents who did 
 not understand the complexities of its use. Cllr Jay called a meeting of the 
 Personnel Committee after the end of the Parish Council meeting to discuss the 
 Clerk’s new salary scales.</p>
