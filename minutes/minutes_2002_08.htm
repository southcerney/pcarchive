    <br>
    <strong>Receipts</strong><br>
    GCC Highways&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contribution to Drain Clearance in Station Road
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £300.00<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Outstanding Accounts</strong><br>
    South Cerney Football Club&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water services 4 March to 18 June
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; £18.59<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Fixed Asset Values</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas, at a previous meeting, had asked why fixed assets were valued at a nominal
    £1. A letter received from Iain Selkirk District Auditor recorded in the Minutes of
    November 2001 had explained: &quot;Regulations stipulate that Fixed Assets should not
    appear on the Balance Sheet but should appear as a note on the Supporting Statement. The
    Village Hall and Upper Up playing fields are community assets which cannot be sold by the
    Council. As a result a nominal value of £1 should be put on them but they should still be
    disclosed as Council assets.&quot; Cllr Nicholas acknowledged that the Village Hall was
    held under a specific Trust but queried if there was a similar Trust in respect of the
    Upper Up playing field because if there was not then he could see no technical reason why
    the Parish Council could not sell it and therefore it should be shown in the Supporting
    Statement as a fixed asset at a proper valuation. Cllr Mrs Gardiner said that in the
    interests of consistency Fixed Assets should be valued at a nominal £1.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 12 August.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Public Rights of Way</strong><br>
    Mr Mould who had attended the Committee meeting made a brief statement on his duties as
    Footpaths and Bridleways officer for the South Cerney Trust and wondered how best he could
    achieve his aims of refurbishing the pathways within the Parish. Cllr Harris pointed out
    that GCC Highways was primarily responsible for footpaths and bridleways in conjunction
    with its PROW officers. He advised Mr Mould to contact either Mr P. Cluely (PROW officer
    at GCC), Mr D. Taylor (GCC Highways) or the Cotswold Water Park regarding problems. Mr
    Mould agreed to pass matters of concern to the Parish Council via the Comments page on the
    Parish Council web site.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart had spoken to Mr B. Greenaway who confirmed that an order has been given for
    the work to be put in hand.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Tower Slide</strong><br>
    Wicksteed Leisure had declined to quote for a scramble type net to access the platform or
    a new decking for the platform but advised the Parish Council to contact the original
    installers. The Clerk was asked to contact alternative sources for a quote.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Traffic Bollards</strong><br>
    GCC Highways acknowledged receipt of the complaint and would ask the developer to rectify
    the situation. A further letter received states that after careful monitoring of the
    situation Development Co-ordinator Christine Cogram could find no justifiable reason to
    have them removed but would be happy to consider any reasonable, valid, justifiable and
    safe reasons to remove them. The Clerk was asked to inform Ms Cogram that the positioning
    of the bollards was forcing large vehicles, including agricultural traffic, on to the
    pavement in order to negotiate the obstructions. Cllr Harris said this type of urban
    furniture was out of keeping with a village environment. It was patently obvious that the
    bollards were an obstruction as each of the four bases was showing considerable damage.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Car Park</strong><br>
    The Committee recommends that S. Clark (Phoenix) be congratulated for the good job he had
    made in reinstating the car park. The Parish Council agreed. It also recommends that a
    sleeping policeman type ramp be constructed near to the entrance to slow down traffic
    exiting/entering the car park. S. Clark would replace the two rubbish bins which had been
    moved during the refurbishment. When the car park surface settles S. Clark suggested that
    a further 50 tons of gravel be rolled in. Cllr Harris proposed to control parking and to
    obviate damage to the car park surface a 24 metre 2-rail fence be erected at right angles
    to the gate. The Clerk was asked to obtain quotations for these three projects.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>BSC11</strong><br>
    A Public Notice in respect of the Footpath Order for BSC11 was published on 25 July and
    notices were put up on the site on 1 August. Anyone wishing to make representations or
    objections to the Order has until 12 September 2002 to do so. If no objection is received
    the Order will be confirmed by the County Council. If there is an objection then the
    matter will be placed with the Secretary of State for the Environment for resolution.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Rusting Manhole Cover in Robert Franklin Way</strong><br>
    The Clerk had informed D. Taylor GCC Highways who confirmed that he would add the matter
    to his schedule.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Playing Fields Warning Signs</strong><br>
    The Clerk had informed D. Taylor GCC Highways who confirmed that he would add the matter
    to his schedule.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ramp at Upper Up</strong><br>
    T. Sibbick had started work on the new access ramp to the Upper Up playing fields.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Football Club</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Mr Slator from Walnut Tree Farmhouse was concerned with the
    proximity of the two temporary junior football pitches situated behind the tennis courts.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner stated that there was nothing exceptional to report. After the refurbishment
    of the car park at Upper Up the litter bins needed to be repositioned. At Cerney Wick the
    problem with the hedge remained. Cllr Stuart will carry out the inspections for the next
    period. The Clerk was asked to write to the new Chairperson of the Cerney Wick Village
    Committee to request that a representative from the Parish Council be invited to its next
    AGM.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that Creoda had withdrawn as a potential contractor. Negotiations
    were continuing with other tenderers. CDC had granted planning permission for the
    development. The Environment Agency returned the £50 fee which the Parish Council had
    paid for the Abstraction Licence.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TREES ON THE PIECE</strong><br>
    The Committee recommends that quotations are sought to prune and tidy the flowering cherry
    and one horse chestnut on the Piece. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; Cllr Stuart was concerned with the design and construction of the fence which
    was being erected to the side of Orchard House. He complained that the resulting work was
    unsightly and dangerous. He also queried the final composition of the hedge. The Clerk was
    asked to write to Mr G. Watson (CDC) for information. Cllr Stuart reported that Mr M.
    Grace (CDC) was overheard informing a resident that Orchard House was outwith the
    Conservation Area and he suggested the Parish Council writes to T. Jones (Chief Planning
    Officer CDC) to remind Mr Grace that Orchard House was within the South Cerney
    Conservation Area. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    Willow Trees in Bow Wow<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the willow trees on the side of the embankment between the Mill
    Stream and the roadway adjacent to Bow Wow needed attention. He considered that three of
    them should be pollarded and one removed. Cllr Harris would liaise with Virginia McClure
    (CDC) on what work she advised.<br>
    Sectional Building adjacent to BSC11<br>
    After a request from Cllr Stuart the Clerk had inquired from Mr M. Grace (Enforcement
    Officer CDC) whether a large timber sectional building which had been erected in a field
    adjacent to BSC11 required planning permission. Mr Grace would investigate.<br>
    Reflective Plastic Bollards<br>
    Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to report to D. Taylor (GCC Highways) that plastic strip
    bollards at the entrance to the village at Upper Up had been vandalised and needed to be
    replaced.<br>
    Village of the Year Prize<br>
    It had been recorded in the Minutes of January 2002 that the Parish Council agreed to
    spend the £100 award on bulbs. Agreement with the majority of residents in Silver Street
    adjacent to the lime trees had been obtained to plant the bulbs. Cllr Stuart recommended
    that bulbs also be planted on the bank outside Upper Up playing field. Cllr Stuart
    continued that unless volunteer labour to plant the bulbs was forthcoming, which he
    doubted, part of the prize money would have to be spent on bulb planting unless the Parish
    Council was prepared to pay for the labour. With the exception of Cllr Mrs Chapman all
    Parish Councillors present volunteered to help with the bulb planting. Cllr Stuart will
    organise the bulb purchase and the planting party.<br>
    Seat at entrance to School Lane<br>
    The Clerk had received a request that the seat by the river at the entrance to School Lane
    be reversed. A villager had complained that to view the river it was necessary to twist
    one's body to do so. The Parish Council was unsympathetic to the request and considered
    the seat to be correctly aligned.<br>
    Ditch in Station Road<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb asked that the overgrowing weeds in the ditch in Station Road be cut back.
    Cllr Harris informed her that it was better for them to die back naturally. The remainder
    of the Committee concurred.<br>
    Telephone Kiosk<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pearse reported that three panes of glass in the telephone kiosk had been broken.<br>
    Fallen Willow<br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported that a fallen willow was obstructing the footpath alongside the
    river which led to Cerney Wick opposite the entrance to the Education lake on the Spine
    Road. Cllr Harris advised that the Clerk inform the Head Ranger at the Cotswold Water
    Park.<br>
    Hedge at Upper Up<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that a hedge near to the entrance of the Upper Up car park was
    overgrowing and becoming a danger to traffic. A section of the hedge was the
    responsibility of the Parish Council. It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr
    Mrs Gardiner that the Parish Council allow £20 for James Harris Contracting to trim back
    the hedge. Cllr Harris declared an interest and did not vote. The remainder of the Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    CDC Reception<br>
    Cllr Stuart stated that he had attended a CDC Reception at Meysey Hampton on 23 July 2002.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Mrs Gardiner closed the meeting at 9.25pm. </td>
