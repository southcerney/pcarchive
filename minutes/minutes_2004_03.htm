    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 10th MARCH 2004</strong>.</p>
    <p align="justify">The meeting began at 7.05pm with Chairman Cllr Stuart 
    welcoming Kevin Dickens Assistant Divisional Officer of the Gloucestershire 
    Ambulance Service and Kim George, who is a member of the St John Ambulance, 
    as Project Manager for Community First Responder Schemes in Gloucestershire. 
    Through a slide show Mr Dickens gave Parish Councillors an insight into the 
    aims, organisation and training of the service. The service aims to recruit 
    First Responders as community based volunteers trained and equipped to 
    respond to any life-threatening medical emergency and to deliver appropriate 
    care until the ambulance arrives. They are highly trained disciplined 
    volunteers who will enhance the existing Ambulance Service by providing 
    early access to medical emergencies in the community either in rural or 
    urban areas across Gloucestershire. About 1 in 1000 people suffer a cardiac 
    arrest each year and approximately half will be in ventricular fibrillation. 
    Up to 60% of these will respond to early defibrillation and survive the 
    experience. First Responders are one way of achieving this as currently less 
    than 10% of those suffering a cardiac arrest survive in the UK. Anyone can 
    become a First Responder if he or she is over 18 years old, physically fit, 
    available, mobile, reliable and confidential and check out with the Criminal 
    Records Bureau. Currently there are 7 operational units in Gloucestershire 
    and these units will multiply across the county. Volunteers would initially 
    be given 3 days training to include the use of an automated external 
    defibrillator (AED), oxygen therapy, manual handling and risk assessment. 
    Afterwards operational experience with a paramedic on a response car and 
    further structured on-going training will be given. A First Responder can be 
    expected to attend the following types of incidents: Cardiac Arrest, Chest 
    Pain, Breathing Difficulties, Unconsciousness, Diabetic Emergency but would 
    not attend: Road Traffic Collisions, Known Violent Situations, Emergencies 
    involving Children. Support would be available through regular group 
    meetings, talks and visits, training updates, debriefing of events attended 
    and confidential one to one counselling. Currently funding is provided by 
    the British Heart Foundation, local and county wide collection boxes, 
    Rotary, Lions, Roundtable, Town and Parish Councils etc. Money raised will 
    be used to support the county wide scheme, purchase training, update and 
    replace equipment. Although the slide show and questions over ran the 
    allotted time the Chairman generously did not intervene and thanked both Mr 
    Dickens and Kim George for their informative presentation.</p>

    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Minutes as 
    altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour and the Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CERNEY WICK PLAYING FIELD</b><br>
    Pauline Rau, Chairperson Cerney Wick Village Committee gave a brief outline 
    of an intended plan that Committee was engaged in to refurbish the play 
    equipment on its playing field. In view of the investment that had been made 
    in play equipment in South Cerney she asked that consideration should be 
    given to upgrading Cerney Wick play area. Cllr Nicholas explained the Parish 
    Council's priorities and how the Robert Franklin Way playing field upgrade 
    had been achieved through equipment donation and the fortuitous acquisition 
    of a second hand unit. Cllr Stuart offered the support of the Parish Council 
    and promised it would look favourably on any scheme which was properly 
    planned, costed and proven to be acceptable to the community. Further 
    information on who to apply to for funding was expressed and Cllr Squire 
    offered his services to help in any grant application that may be made.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Pedestrian Crossing(s)</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas will meet with Brian Clifford, Chairman of Anne Edwards School 
    Governors and Sue Andrews to discuss the position of where to install up to 
    2 pedestrian crossings. Cllr Nicholas reiterated that such crossings would 
    be of valuable assistance to all in the community especially children, 
    elderly and disabled.<br>
    <b>Ham Lane</b><br>
    Parish Councillors agreed that the Clerk should write to Sapco One Ltd to 
    ascertain if a solution could be found to provide a more safe access across 
    its boundary between Sudeley Drive and Ham Lane. The Clerk was asked to 
    point out that the current unauthorised access was unsafe but that the 
    Parish Council would be prepared to contribute to the installation of a more 
    permanent ramp if Sapco One Ltd agreed.<br>
    <b>Dental Practice</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had contacted Mr A. Jones (CDC Planning) who informed 
    her that the objection from the Parish Council had been noted but an officer 
    had decided that it was not valid.<br>
    <b>CT.1454/3/Y Wildmoor Waters, Wildmoorway Lane, South Cerney</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas explained that no further opportunity existed to comment on 
    this application as the Parish Council had taken its decision at a previous 
    meeting.<br>
    <b>CT.8163/J Orchard House, Upper Up, South Cerney</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that M. Kitchen (CDC Planning) was well aware 
    of every tree and has not yet dealt with the application.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK'S REPORT</b><br>
    On February 19th I attended a meeting of the Market Towns forum in 
    Cirencester College. Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart was also in attendance.<br>
    The SWOT analysis was discussed and how the group should move forward. Cllr 
    Nicholas volunteered to join the Steering Committee.<br>
    During February I logged 77 3/4 hours which over the 20 days available 
    averaged 3hrs 53 mins which is on target for the agreed contract. Along with 
    Cllr Stuart I met with Victoria Parker on Tuesday 2 March to discuss 
    possible solutions to the damaged safety surfaces on the three play areas. 
    Ms Parker demonstrated a covering which could either replace or be laid on 
    top of the existing tiles and promised to give the Parish Council a 
    quotation.<br>
    Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) reported on 5 March that the adoption of Kingfisher 
    Place has been agreed by Watermark, Redcliffe Homes and the legal department 
    at GCC. It has been passed to GCC Highways for its acceptance and problems 
    not envisaged.<br>
    Phil Clueley GCC PROW (01452 425727) informed me on 8 March that substantial 
    surface work will be undertaken by Ringway on the old railway line between 
    Silver Street and Robert Franklin Way from mid to end of this week for two 
    weeks to improve the route for disability access. At 9am on Tuesday 9 March, 
    along with Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire, I met with Roy Alcock of Sutcliffe 
    Play Co to discuss possible solutions for the repair or replacement of the 
    damaged safety surfaces at the play areas. Cllr Nicholas explained part of 
    the work the Cirencester Healthcheck Steering Committee would be involved 
    in. Primarily it was to enhance and improve facilities in Cirencester as the 
    hub of the hinterland. With the support of local communities it would make 
    it easier to obtain grant funding for projects. Cllr Stuart said that he 
    would like to be more proactive within the group and Cllr Nicholas suggested 
    that he might deputise for him on occasions.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and 
    Playing Fields Committee that had met on 8 March.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Safety Tiles at Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had with a technical representative 
    from Matta Products who had quoted £19,500 to replace the safety tiles with 
    another type of surface a sample of which the Committee inspected. Cllr 
    Stuart and Cllr Squire had a meeting with a representative from Sutcliffe 
    Play who proposed to use a wet pour rubberised compound in place of the 
    tiles and his quotation will be analysed at next month's meeting.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Cycle Mounds</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a competing contractor and 
    left the room. The three quotations received to install the drain and 
    associated works were analysed by the remaining members. James Harris 
    Contracting was selected for the work as his quotation was the lowest. It 
    was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that James Harris 
    Contracting be contracted for the work. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Planting</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had created a specification for types and numbers of plants 
    needed. The Parish Council agreed that this document form the basis of a 
    tender document which the Clerk will send out for quotation.<br>
    <b>Noticeboard</b><br>
    The Clerk had obtained a quotation from Greenbarnes Ltd to supply self 
    sealing pin board at a cost of £215.50 to include delivery and VAT. Two 
    quotations for the repair and refurbishment of the noticeboard at the bus 
    stop outside the Limes had been received. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and 
    seconded by Cllr Nicholas that R. O. W. Berry who had given the lower price 
    be contracted for the work. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had been in contact with Stephen Wright (GRCC) who had promised 
    to send an application form to enter the Village of the Year competition. He 
    had also emailed Laura Oakley in order that action could begin by 
    incorporating the Cirencester Healthcheck, Village of the Year and Bledisloe 
    Best Kept Village competition in the plan. Cllr Jay, Cllr Smith, Cllr Squire 
    and Cllr Stuart agreed to meet at 2.30pm on 17th March as a sub-committee 
    and the Clerk was asked to book the Committee Room for the venue.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that he had removed a considerable amount of small 
    stones which had been thrown onto the safety surface of the slide. Litter 
    was becoming a problem despite the efforts of Mr Curtis. Cllr Stuart 
    suggested that perhaps the new Community Support Officer might be asked to 
    curtail this behaviour. The mounds are used extensively but although the 
    weather has been much drier some puddles still exist.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the tower slide, as the only piece of equipment 
    officially in use, was in good order. John Hicks would inspect the new 
    installation on Thursday. A new form to include the extra play equipment 
    would been needed for future inspections. Warning notices informing children 
    not to use the new equipment until it had passed inspection had been ignored 
    and some youths were using the slide with mountain bikes and skateboards. 
    Cllr Harris suggested that the pole swing might be screened from the 
    neighbouring property by planting a hedge. The swing had to be placed nearer 
    the edge of the play area due to the ground conditions experienced when it 
    was being installed. A solution was needed to dampen the excessive noise 
    generated through the use of the Haggs unit. The Clerk was to ask Steve 
    Griffiths (Macventure Play Co) to recover the road pins and euromesh as 
    children were transferring it to the river. Cllr Harris reported that two 
    wheels were missing from the static train. Cllr Harris reported that the 
    refurbished play area was being well utilised although a curfew will have to 
    be imposed if the late use, sometimes as late as 1am, continues. Cllr Harris 
    had used a chain to secure the tyre swing from being used but children had 
    used a hacksaw to cut through the chain to play on the equipment. So far he 
    reported that two children needed medical treatment for accidents which had 
    occurred. Cllr Stuart was concerned that the new safety surface was not 
    level enough and might well be damaged when the grass covering is mowed. The 
    older children are using the seat in the fenced off area to jump over the 
    fence and it will have to be moved near to the gate. The gate entrance is 
    too steep and will need to be levelled. If the seeded area within the fenced 
    off area does not take quickly it will be necessary to lay a turf covering. 
    Parish Councillors agreed that a ceremony, to include invited guests be 
    held, to formally open the refurbished play area, subject to the 
    installation safety check. The chain link fence to the south of the site was 
    beyond sensible repair and needed to be replaced. The Clerk was asked to 
    obtain quotations for this work.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that everything on the play area was clean and 
    tidy.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee that had met 
    on 8 March.<br>
    Matters Arising<br>
    Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart had withdrawn their quotation to redecorate the 
    Village Hall. Cllr Stuart, in his capacity as Village Hall Committee 
    Chairman, reported four tenders were expected by 23rd March and a decision 
    taken on who to contract would be taken when these had been received.<br>

    On the payment to James Harris Contracting, Cllr Harris declared a 
    prejudicial interest as payee and left the room. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs 
    Pollard and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council pay the 
    outstanding account from James Harris Contracting. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour. Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting.<br>
    Cllr Jay inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for February. The 
    Parish Council agreed to make an interim payment of £11,000.00 to Macventure 
    Play Co and to pay G. Cornelius in full subject to the installation 
    inspection report being acceptable. This would leave a balance of £10,161.45<br>
    It was then proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the 
    Parish Council make the rest of the listed payments with the exception of 
    the account due to the Village Hall. The Parish Council was all in favour. 
    Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart declared a prejudicial interest as 
    members of the Village Hall Committee in the next payment and left the room. 
    It was then proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Squire that the 
    Parish Council make the payment to the Village Hall. The Parish Council was 
    all in favour. Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart rejoined the 
    meeting.<br>
    <br>

    favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee that 
    had met on 8 March.<br>

    Amended Plans: New building to provide restaurant, gym and swimming pool at 
    Spring Lakes, Station Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    1. A 10,000 sq.ft. two storey building in this position would completely 
    dominate this approach to the village. It is a site that is very open, 
    viewed from the south eastern fringes of the village, and the building would 
    be very conspicuous, positioned right next to the road.<br>
    2. A recreational facility of this size will attract visitors (by car) from 
    much further afield than just the adjoining Watermark properties.<br>
    3. The application is deficient, because it does not show comparative levels 
    for the building and the adjoining road (and bund), nor does it give any 
    indication of the colour of external materials.<br>
    4. First floor windows would cause substantial 'light pollution' and visual 
    intrusion at night, due to the proposed late opening hours.<br>

    <b>CT.0006/3/S</b><br>
    Variation of Condition 20 of permission CT.0006/2/X for erection of boundary 
    fence at The Limes, South Cerney, Glos GL7 5RF<br>
    This application was refused for the following reason: This is an extensive 
    boundary to a residential development of 30 houses and associated works that 
    is also in close proximity to the South Cerney Conservation Area. The 
    erection of this 1.8m high close-boarded fence rather than the permitted 
    natural stone wall detracts from the character and appearance of the 
    adjoining residential development and conservation area. The proposal is 
    therefore contrary to Policies 1, 29 and 40 of the Cotswold District Local 
    Plan, Policy NHE6 of the Gloucestershire Structure Plan Second Review and 
    the guidance in PPG15.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.8163/H</b><br>
    Retention of stone wall at Orchard House, Upper Up, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos. This application was refused for the following reason: 
    The increase in height of this wall up to 2.4m produces an imposing and 
    uncharacteristic addition to the South Cerney Conservation Area by virtue of 
    the height of the structure and its overbearing physical appearance. The 
    proposal is thereby contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings 
    and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Government guidance set out in PPG15, 
    Policy NHE6 of the Gloucestershire Structure Plan Second Review and Policies 
    1, 29 and 40 of the Cotswold District Local Plan.<br>

    <b>MEMBERS' ALLOWANCES</b><br>
    On the subject of whether Parish Councillors should accept allowances or not 
    Cllr Jay argued that if the Parish Council refuses to agree to accept then 
    no one has an opportunity to decline payment. If it was agreed to accept 
    allowances then it would be a personal decision of a Parish Councillor 
    whether or not to take payment. Cllr Nicholas said that he did not agree 
    that it is necessary that Parish Councillors are paid an allowance to 
    attract them as candidates and would abstain in the vote. Cllr Smith queried 
    if any one had canvassed local opinion but Cllr Stuart replied that Parish 
    Councillors are representatives and elected or co-opted to make reasoned 
    judgements. Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Webb seconded the motion that South 
    Cerney Parish Council intends to introduce the payment of members' 
    allowances as set out in the report and recommendations of the Independent 
    Remuneration Panel. Parish Councillors voted 6 in favour, 2 against and 2 
    abstentions. The motion was therefore carried.<br>

    that signs were again reappearing on the corner of the Spine Road and

    at the same junction and the cycle track was also suffering from amassing 
    mud.<br>
