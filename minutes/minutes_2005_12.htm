    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 14th December 2005</strong>.</p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, 
    Cllr M. Stuart welcomed Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Ian Yeomans. 
    PCSO Yeomans explained that his role was of a supporting nature to enable 
    policemen concentrate on the more acute elements of police work. His 
    presence, although in uniform, generally allowed the streets to be free of 
    regular police and he felt able to bridge the gap between the public and 
    police. It was, he emphasised the way forward at the moment. Around South 
    Cerney his duties mostly consisted of keeping vehicles off pavements and 
    other illegal or inconsiderate parking habits and curbing antisocial 
    behaviour by the youth element of the village. He was actively trying to 
    solve parking problems at the school when buses dropped off or collected 
    pupils. Cllr Squire complained that parking outside Londis in Broadway Lane 
    was thoroughly dangerous at times. Cllr Jay and Cllr Harris expressed 
    discontent about vehicles parking inconsiderately on the defined footpaths 
    in Clarks Hay outside the Chapel and by the garage. Through his plan of 
    action he always issued a verbal warning and if that was not heeded then he 
    would issue a ticket to offenders. This procedure has been successful in the 
    Lennards and Robert Franklin Way areas. One of his problems was in accessing 
    transport to rural areas including South Cerney from Cirencester. Cllr Jay 
    raised the problem of cyclists of all ages using footpaths especially from 
    Box Bush through to Bow Wow lane which was causing a problem for the elderly 
    pedestrians. Cllr Nicholas pointed out that the proliferation of advertising 
    signs in the vicinity of the cross roads at Station Road, Cerney Wick Lane 
    and Spine Road (B4696) was potentially dangerous. He reminded PCSO Yeomans 
    that a fatal accident had occurred there this year. PCSO Yeomans would 
    inform the Police Traffic Sergeant. He recommended that the Parish Council 
    considers lighting the play area at Upper Up as the darkened area there 
    provided sanctuary for potential vandalism. Cllr Harris, who lives in the 
    area of the playing field, voiced his reluctance as he had experienced 
    annoyance during the summer period when the equipment on the play area was 
    being used as late as 2am. He thought that by providing lighting the area 
    might be used even more often late at night throughout the year which was 
    unacceptable to local residents. PCSO Yeomans’ patrol ‘patch’ included South 
    Cerney including the Duke of Gloucester Barracks, Siddington, part of 
    Somerford Keynes and Cirencester. The cctv camera at Upper Up was still in 
    use and he had personally used it some three weeks ago. The assembled Parish 
    Councillors and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) agreed totally with Cllr Stuart who in 
    conclusion said that the Parish Council totally supported the concept and 
    work of PCSOs. He then thanked PCSO Yeomans for his attendance. PCSO Yeomans 
    then left the meeting at 7.35pm.</span></font></p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">On Thursday 17th November I attended a meeting to 
 discuss the final draft of the Village Plan. Originally scheduled to be held in 
 the Village Hall the meeting adjourned to Cllr Jay’s house. Also present were 
 Cllr Mrs Pollard, Cllr Squire, Cllr Stuart, Cllr Webb and Cllr Jay. During the 
 course of the period I contacted Amanda Keys GCC PROW and enquired about 
 progress on the enquiry to decide the outcome of BSC11. A Modification Order 
 application was lodged to incorporate the path from Berkeley Close to Upper Up 
 as a public right of way in March 2001. Various reasons were offered on its 
 slow progress but Mrs Keys did confirm that the application was now seventh in 
 the queue. After consulting the Chairman, Cllr Stuart it was decided to ask Mr 
 Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP to exert his influence in expediting a resolution. 
 Cllr Parsons (GCC) has been kept informed. On Thursday 8th December I 
 accompanied Cllr Stuart to the CDC where we represented the Parish Council at a 
 meeting to discuss the Gloucestershire Charter which will set out protocols to 
 encourage better cooperation between the Parish Councils, Town Councils and 
 Gloucestershire County Council. Although the CDC had been invited to 
 participate, its excuse for delay was that the timing was inopportune. 
 Delegates present were encouraged to pressurise their local District 
 Councillors to provoke action from that Council Executive. Participation in the 
 Charter is one of the criteria required for the Best Practice assessment.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">During November over the 22 days available I 
 averaged 3 hours 20 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</span></font></p>

 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Mud on the highways<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Committee agreed with Cllr Caunce who 
 requested that Earthline contractors be complimented on their efforts to keep 
 Cerney Wick Lane clear of mud from Lake 10 west to the entrance to Lake 11.<br>
 Cllr Harris complained that vehicles using Shorncote quarry were leaving debris 
 on the highway. An email had been sent to GCC Highways to complain, a copy of 
 which also went to Somerford and Siddington Parish Councils.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Adjustments to Speed Limits and 
 Interactive Speed Signs<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Mr Whittaker, GCC Highways had informed 
 that no objections to the proposed speed alterations on the Silver Street to 
 Preston Toll Bar road had been received during the consultation period which 
 expired earlier in December. The interactive speed signs were awaited.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Advertising Signs<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">No reply had been received from Mrs G. 
 Portlock (GCC Highways) regarding the proliferation of advertising signs 
 throughout the village. On Wednesday 14th the Clerk had met Mrs Portlock who 
 complained that she had not received the correspondence. The Clerk had then 
 emailed the relevant letters and Mrs Portlock had confirmed their receipt.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Tarmac<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">No quote had been received from Mr Francis 
 to resurface the car park at Upper Up with tarmac although the Clerk reported 
 that he had spoken directly with Mr Francis regarding the work. GCC Highways 
 had given the Clerk the names of two contractors whom he had contacted. Cllr 
 Harris asked that Gibbs Tarmac, Orchard Industrial Estate, Kiln Lane, Swindon 
 SN2 2NP be requested to give a quotation.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">360 deg Swing<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">A letter had been received from Steve 
 Griffiths, Macventure Play Co explaining probable causes of the excessive 
 movement in the supporting legs. Members of the Committee agreed to inspect the 
 swing once again to ascertain if the wet weather had any effect on the 
 stability of the equipment.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Robert Franklin Way</span></font> Slide<br>
 </b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr 
 Stuart had spoken to Steve Hanson of the Community Pay Back group who indicated 
 that his labour force would be willing to dismantle the slide. Cllr Squire 
 reported that Hills had declined to supply a skip at no cost. The Committee 
 recommends that the Parish Council agrees to finance the hire of a skip to 
 dispose of the resultant debris when the slide is removed. Cllr Harris and Cllr 
 Caunce volunteered to dispose of the steel frame and rubber tiles.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Public Rights of Way<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Stuart reported on his meeting with 
 Mike Barton GCC PROW regarding the footpath from Upper Up to Keynes Park. An 
 alternative temporary footpath would be created to help progress the 
 establishment of a more permanent route. The proposed cycle path to Siddington 
 along the route of the old canal was in abeyance awaiting a quotation for a 
 replacement bridge which would be similar to that over the river Churn at Bow 
 Wow. Mike Barton intends to liaise with the relevant landowners along the 
 route.</span></font></p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Cerney Wick play area<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Caunce reported no problems with the 
 equipment. A working party had been arranged to cut the hedge back on 14th 
 January 2006.</span></font></p>

 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Robert Franklin Way</span></font> play area<br>
 </b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr 
 Harris reported that apart from the 360 degree swing all equipment was in a 
 satisfactory condition. The ash tree had been cleared away and the ‘No Dog’ 
 signs would be installed when supplied.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Upper Up play area<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Stuart reported that the step ladder 
 to the slide was now in working order after alterations, suggested by Mr J. 
 Hicks at his safety inspection, had been carried out. The hedge between the 
 Cricket Club and the lake would be cut back shortly after Christmas.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in 
 the next item and left the room.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Trees continue to be vandalised. It was proposed 
 by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council accepts a 
 quotation from James Harris Contracting to supply and fix a 3-pole support 2 
 metres high with green tubular tree ties at a price of £15 per tree. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Harris returned to the room.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PRECEPT CONSIDERATIONS<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Committee proposes that three new 
 schemes be considered for action: 1. Resurface the car parking area at Upper Up 
 playing fields with tarmacadam; 2. Planting wet land area at Upper Up; 3. 
 Removing silt and debris from ditch in Station Road.</span></font></p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Harris reported that a Willow Pollard 
 is in a dangerous condition along the footpath which leads from the Old George 
 Public House car park and parallel to Bow Wow. The tree is unsafely propped up 
 with a wooden stake and could collapse. Cllr Nicholas noted that the path was 
 becoming difficult to use with bits of trees stuck in the path to obstruct 
 users and leaves and other garden refuse left to rot on the surface of the 
 path. The Clerk had informed Mike Barton, GCC PROW.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Jay reported that after recent repair work 
 to damaged sewage pipes in Station Road the contractors had left a quantity of 
 gravel in the ditch. Cllr Harris had inspected but did not consider the gravel 
 as any sort of hazard.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Webb was concerned that land owned by the 
 Parish Council should be registered with the Land Registry. The Clerk will 
 check with Valerie Hancock of Davey Franklin Jones if any Parish Council land 
 holdings, especially the playing fields at Upper Up and the Piece in Station 
 Road, need to be registered.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">FINANCE<br>

 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Webb reminded the Committee that it 
 must consider providing computer equipment for the Clerk. Cllr Jay suggested 
 that a Contingency Fund be created to allow for unbudgeted expense. The Finance 
 Committee would debate that option when it next meets. Cllr Smith agreed to 
 hold the meeting at his home on Thursday 5th January 2006 at 7.30pm to discuss

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">Clerk’s Gratuity<br>
 </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Clerk explained that he had 
 miscalculated the amount required to provide his contracted gratuity. It was 
 previously thought that the gratuity would be calculated on final earnings but 
 recent information received means that it will be based on the Lower Earnings 
 limit which is currently in the region of £4,000. This would mean a gratuity at 
 the moment of approximately £1,200 to be paid tax free. New rules coming into 
 force in April 2006 will mean that any gratuity earned after that date will 
 attract income tax. The Clerk has asked that the Parish Council considers 
 enrolling him in the GCC Pension Fund. Cllr Webb suggested to the Clerk that he 
 enquires from the SLCC how the new conditions will affect his gratuity. Cllr 
 Jay asked the Clerk if he would ask Ms R. Henson, GCC Pensions if she would 
 meet with Parish Councillors to explain the implications of the Clerk becoming 
 a member of the GCC Pension Fund.</span></font></p>

 declared a prejudicial interest in this item he informed the Parish Council 
 that income from the Cutts Charity, which totalled approximately £260, would be 
 divided equally between the Church, Parish Council and the poor. If the Parish 
 Council refuses to accept its portion then the amount given to the poor could 
 be doubled. This year the Cutts Charity intends to support Will Fenton in his 
 efforts to walk again after a bad trampoline accident which dislocated his neck 
 and severely damaged his spinal cord. Will needs the money to pay for a 
 revolutionary stem cell therapy.</span></font></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Prior to the meeting the Clerk had emailed a copy 
 of the final draft of the Village Plan created by Cllr Mrs Pollard to all 
 Parish Councillors. Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart individually 
 thanked Cllr Mrs Pollard for her efforts and the other Parish Councillors 
 concurred. The Parish Council accepted an offer from Cllr Jay to produce 1,500 
 photocopies of the document for £30 which the Clerk estimated was 50% less than 
 the best commercial rate available. Cllr Jay commended the document to the 
 Parish Council and after some minor alterations it was proposed by Cllr Smith 
 and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council accepts the proposals as 
 laid out in the draft. The Parish Council was all in favour. The Clerk would 
 email a copy to Mel Tarrant (GRCC) and ask her to forward any comments to Cllr 
 Jay. Cllr Mrs Pollard volunteered to help Cllr Jay in collating the document 
 into the February edition of Cerney News.</span></font></p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Parsons (GCC) emailed that some success on 
 road cleaning had been achieved. For example to the west of Somerford Keynes, 
 Hills have agreed to stop moving earth onto a new golf course until next March. 
 The site at Watermark was more difficult as enforcement for this site now rests 
 with CDC since it is no longer a minerals site. There is a wheel wash but it is 
 poorly sited and Earthline (Lake 10) are not that co-operative.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">There is a tremendous work load and little 
 resource available to resolve the determination of BSC11. Each Modification 
 Order takes a long time to prepare. If more supporting reasons could be 
 furnished it might help to expedite a conclusion.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) said that details would be 
 published early in the new year on criteria to access 2nd homes community 
 charge money which amounts to approximately £300,000 in the District. The money 
 would be open to bid for as ‘stand alone’ capital grants. Cllr Jay and Cllr 
 Webb queried why 2nd homes money is not allocated as part of the precept. This 
 year the local tax base, which is used to express Band ‘D’ equivalent 
 properties, had increased by 16.6. If all 2nd homes in the Parish were included 
 the tax base would increase significantly thereby lowering the demand on local 
 residents. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) promised to inquire.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that the mobile 
 internet cafe would be starting in February and the Parish Council would be 
 notified shortly.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Caunce volunteered to be responsible for the 
 Highway matters portfolio.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Webb queried when Minutes of the Cotswold 
 Waterpark Liaison Committee meeting he had attended two months previously might 
 be published. Cllr Jay replied that they might be published a week before the 
 next meeting but unapproved Minutes should be available from the Secretary if 
 requested. Cllr Webb queried when was the deadline for applying for 2nd home 
 grant money. This information was not available as the criteria had not yet 
 been received.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to supply a list of 
 meeting dates for the coming year.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Jay had objected to a plan by the 
 Environment Agency to site a large oblong green monitoring box alongside the 
 bridge outside the Village Hall as it would have a detrimental visual effect on 
 the Conservation Area. Cllr Squire reported that after a conversation he had 
 with contractors he preferred that the monitoring box would be sited further up 
 stream.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Jay pleaded with the Chairman to instruct 
 Committee Chairmen who make an apology for absence to inform their deputies, or 
 who ever may be asked, to Chair the committee in their absence.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Jay reported on a meeting he and Cllr Stuart 
 attended with Clare Dowan, CDC Youth Participation Officer. It was hoped to set 
 up a Youth Parish Council in South Cerney, including Cerney Wick, involving 11 
 to 18 year olds. An inaugural meeting was planned for January 11th at 4pm and 
 elections could take place in April 2006. CDC will facilitate training and 
 Parish Councillors are encouraged to forward names of suitable participants to 
 either Cllr Jay or Cllr Stuart. It was planned to invite candidates from a 
 cross-section of genders and geographical location.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Nicholas reported that the memorial tree 
 planted to commemorate Jim Parker, deceased Past Chairman of the Parish 
 Council, had been irreparably damaged by Avent Engineering Ltd, Bath Road 
 Industrial Estate, Chippenham, Wiltshire SN14 0AB. The Clerk was to write and 
 ask them to pay for the cost of replanting a new tree.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported on a meeting of the 
 Cerney Wick Village Committee she attended, which was primarily concerned with 
 planning applications on Lakes 10 and 11. A traffic survey is to be carried out 
 by Watermark and an analysis of this by Peter Finalyson is anticipated to cost 
 Cerney Wick residents £300. It was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr 
 Nicholas that the Parish Council makes a grant of £300 maximum to Cerney Wick 
 Village Committee to subsidise the cost of the analysis. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour. The Clerk was asked to inform Carey Bamford, Chair Cerney Wick 
 Village Committee.</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">There being no further business the Chairman, 
 Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 9.47pm.</span></font></td>
