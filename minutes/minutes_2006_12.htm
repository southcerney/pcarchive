 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Chairman, Cllr Stuart welcomed Youth Parish Councillors 
 Miss Sinead Peare and Miss Rachael King to the meeting, congratulating the YPC 
 on the success of its recent Fun Run. YPC Miss Peare enquired if the provision 
 of Christmas lights was possible for next year’s festive season. The Clerk 
 explained that if the planned lights were parallel to the carriageway it would 
 be procedurally easier and less expensive to insure. The Clerk agreed to 
 forward the YPC information on suppliers of commercial display lights. YPC Miss 
 Peare agreed to email the Clerk a covering letter to accompany the cheque to 
 Sport Relief explaining the donation to the Mile Events charity. Both Youth 
 Parish Councillors were told that Cllr P. Jay would supply copying paper if 
 they were to contact him. Concern was raised as to how members of the YPC could 
 be contacted via the web site. The Clerk suggested that they send a trial email 
 through the web site to test the facility.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 10th November I attended the opening event of 
 the South Cerney Play Group’s new building at Berkeley Close. On Monday 27th 
 November I attended a meeting with Jennifer Watkins, Gloucestershire Highways 
 Senior Highway Representative to discuss how to proceed with the refurbishment 
 of the river bank through Bow Wow. Also present were Cllr Stuart, Cllr Harris 
 and Steve Hanson from the Pay Back in the Community team. It was agreed that 
 gabion baskets be used in the first stage of the work which was expected to 
 begin early in the new year. On Thursday 30th November Cllr Stuart accompanied 
 me on an abortive trip to the Westwoods Centre at Northleach where a seminar 
 was expected to be held on the future of local government. The event had been 
 cancelled 10 days prior but no notice had been received. During November of the 
 22 available working days available I averaged just under 3 hours per day which 
 is slightly less than my contract allows.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Speed Limits</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported that the speed limits leaving Trenchard Gardens to the 
 main carriageway South Cerney to Preston Toll Bar had not been changed to 
 reflect the new conditions now existing. The Clerk had informed Gloucestershire 
 Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch <br>
 </b>On Wednesday 13th December, Cllr Stuart and the Clerk had met with Mark 
 Roberts from Thames Water to point out that the full length of the open ditch 
 would require cleaning. Mr Roberts estimated that the total 235 metres of the 
 open ditch would need to be cleared. Cllr Stuart had confirmed with Ms J. 
 Elliott Thames Water that the work would be carried out. During the inspection 
 it was noted by Cllr Stuart that there was a deteriorating gas main at the 
 entrance to the culvert outside the property known as Mudeford which needed 
 attention. The Clerk was asked to inform Gloucestershire Highways of the 
 potential problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Advertising</b> <b>“A” Boards <br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to inform Gloucestershire Highways that 
 unauthorised advertising boards had been placed on either side of the Spine 
 Road, south of the Cerney Wick/Station Road crossroads. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Crossing Patrol</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported that a recent survey to calculate the pedestrian use of 
 High Street, Broadway Lane and Berkeley Close had shown that its use was three 
 (3) times the minimum required for the provision of a crossing patrol person. 
 Currently Ann Edwards school was actively trying to recruit personnel for this 
 purpose. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick Lane ditch</b> <br>
 With respect to Cllr Mrs Chapman’s enquiry regarding the damage to the ditch 
 near Tien House the Clerk replied that there had been no response. The Clerk 
 was asked to report it again to Gloucestershire Highways. There was concern 
 that action on items such as this could be forgotten. The Clerk agreed to a 
 suggestion from Cllr Webb that reference to correspondence be recorded in the 
 Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Field and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 11th December. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BetterDrivingPlease.com</b> <br>
 The Clerk had reported that no reply had yet been received to the query about 
 the attitude of the police to the web site. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Police Consultation</b> <br>
 Inspector Williams had requested that a Parish Councillor join him at a 
 consultation exercise to be held at police headquarters on Friday 15th 
 December. The consultation was to discuss altering existing police areas and of 
 particular interest was a suggestion that South Cerney comes under the umbrella 
 of Cirencester rather than its current rural position. Inspector Williams 
 emphasised that such a change would mean that South Cerney competes with other 
 areas of Cirencester for police resources. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council supported the status quo that South 
 Cerney remains as part of the existing policing arrangement. Cllr Webb agreed 
 to accompany the Clerk to attend the consultation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewerage Pipe Line</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that minor modifications to the line of the new 
 sewerage pipe were on going.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow River Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had considered that a meeting held on 27th November attended by 
 Cllr Squire, Cllr Stuart, Parish Clerk, Jennifer Watkins – Senior Highway 
 Representative Gloucestershire Highways and Steve Hanson – Payback in the 
 Community Supervisor was very positive. Jennifer Watkins was now fully aware of 
 the erosion problem, the necessity for action and stated that a proper survey 
 would be carried out. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Hedge in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 It was pointed out to Jennifer Watkins the escalating problem with the 
 overgrowing hedge adjacent to Lady Fanshawe’s property. It is not clear whether 
 or not Lady Fanshawe claims ownership of the hedge. The Clerk was asked to 
 write to Dave Flagg, Signs &amp; Lines Technician at Gloucestershire Highways to 
 enquire if any progress had been made to resolve the predicament. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart then stated that in a recent telephone call 
 with Lady Fanshawe she claimed ownership of the said hedge. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fallen Willow Tree <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart had agreed with Steve Hanson, Payback in the Community 
 supervisor, that his team cut up the branches of the fallen willow on Upper Up 
 play area. A suggestion from Cllr Caunce, that an eco-pile be constructed from 
 the logs to encourage wild life, was agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris agreed to supply sheep wire to secure the 
 structure. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Invitations Accepted</b> <br>
 Steve Hodgson, Waters Edge, Lake 10 Cerney Wick Lane and Max Thomas, Watermark 
 had both accepted an invitation from the Parish Council to attend a meeting 
 with Parish Councillors. As Steve Hodgson had replied first, the Clerk 
 confirmed that February 14th was available. Max Thomas had replied some time 
 after accepting the same date but the Clerk decided to await a final decision 
 from the Parish Council before a reply was sent. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed that the Clerk inform Mr Thomas 
 that the February date was no longer available and suggest alternatives to him.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that everything on the playing field was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
 Cllr Harris had reported that four bolts were needed on the Train Unit. The 
 Committee agreed that he should proceed with the task. The Tower Slide Unit had 
 now been demolished although he estimated that 7 tonnes of soil was needed to 
 refurbish the ground.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b><br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that the play equipment was in good order. On Friday 
 8th December, miscreants had used toilet rolls to decorate most pieces of 
 equipment. Mr Curtis would clear it away. The drain on the cycle mounds 
 installed by James Harris Contracting was working well. Gloucestershire 
 Highways had kindly used left over tarmac to fill in several holes near the 
 entrance to the car park. Old concrete building had been removed. Due to recent 
 heavy rain, parts of the field were saturated and the path under water in 
 places.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PUBLIC OPEN SPACE ON BLOOR HOMES’DEVELOPMENT IN 
 BERKELEY CLOSE</b><br>
 Based on calculations supplied by Guy Wakefield, Cllr Caunce did not agree with 
 the assumption that grass cutting could be estimated at £174. He contended that 
 £600 was a more realistic figure. Any payment made by Bloor Homes must be given 
 without covenant or condition and land transferred to the ownership of the 
 Parish Council. The Committee agreed to recommend that the Parish Council 
 insists on a figure in excess of the latest offer in view of the fact that a 
 further 5 (five) houses had been granted planning permission. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REMOVAL OF CONTAMINATED WASTE</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had reminded the Committee that it had been agreed to remove the 
 redundant concrete shed and place the debris in the skip provided by Hills. 
 Although Pay Back in the Community team had agreed to inspect the shed prior to 
 its being razed it had not been possible to determine the state of the roof 
 which was covered with a thick layer of mulch. In removing the mulch it was 
 discovered that bonded asbestos sheet had been used in its construction. After 
 the Payback in the Community team, quite rightly, refused to handle the 
 material, Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart and John Hunt cleared the site with the help 
 of a trailer supplied by James Harris Contracting. After a great deal of 
 bureaucratic procedure permission was eventually obtained to dump the waste at 
 a controlled site using a skip commercially provided by Hills Ltd. <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Committee 
 agrees to recommend that the Parish Council supports the actions as detailed 
 above. The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ALTERATION TO A RESTRICTIVE COVENANT ON PUBLIC LAND AT 
 THE LIMES<br>
 </b>The Clerk reported that Mr Kelsey had recently enquired into purchasing a 
 small plot of land within the Limes although previously he had been informed 
 that there was a restrictive covenant which prevented the Parish Council from 
 selling it. Mr Kelsey had ascertained that it would be possible, with the 
 agreement of interested parties, to lift this covenant so that not all but part 
 of the plot could be used for private purposes. The Committee recommends that 
 the Parish Council does not agree to alter the restrictive covenant as stated 
 in the S.106 agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PRECEPT CONSIDERATIONS</b> <br>
 Consideration is made for: <br>
 1. the clearing of the open ditch in Station Road <br>
 2. a grant to defray the cost of the over spend experienced by the Cricket Club 
 with its recent refurbishment of the cricket pitch <br>
 3. ground maintenance contracts in South Cerney and Cerney Wick based on the 
 return of tenders which the Clerk will endeavour to achieve prior to the 
 precept meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence</b> <br>
 36.&nbsp;&nbsp; P. Purvey Groundwork Contractor – Quotations to refurbish Upper 
 Up car park <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clerk was asked to obtain a further 
 quotation from Atkins </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Squire had closed the 
 meeting at 8:37pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith reported on the discussions of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on 11th December.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Use of S.106 Contributions</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had responded that no decision regarding the use of S.106 
 contributions to clean the Spine Road had been taken by the Cotswold Water Park 
 Joint Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Alteration to a Restrictive Covenant on Public Land at 
 the Limes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that Mr Kelsey had recently enquired 
 into purchasing a small plot of land within the Limes although previously he 
 had been informed that there was a restrictive covenant which prevented the 
 Parish Council from selling it. Mr Kelsey had ascertained that it would be 
 possible, with the agreement of interested parties, to lift this covenant so 
 that not all but part of the plot could be used for private purposes. Cllr Jay 
 had argued, on Monday evening, that such a plot should not be enclosed as it 
 was a designed open space within the development. Cllr Nicholas pointed out 
 that for the covenant to be altered it would need the agreement of all parties 
 and he was not in favour. The Committee recommended that the Parish Council 
 does not agree to alter the restrictive covenant as stated in the S.106 
 agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard that the Parish Council does not alter the restrictive covenant as 
 stated in the S.106 agreement regarding public open space at the Limes 
 development in South Cerney. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in
 Berkeley Close
 </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to ask Guy Wakefield to clarify any proposed 
 agreement, particularly if any payment made would come with an obligation to 
 install and maintain. Cllr Nicholas stated that any agreement to alter existing 
 planning conditions would have to be confirmed by CDC. Any payment made by 
 Bloor Homes must be given without covenant or condition and land transferred to 
 the ownership of the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The deliberations of both committees were discussed. It 
 was agreed that the Clerk inform Guy Wakefield that the Parish Council want it 
 confirmed that any payment will be in accordance with the proposal that it be 
 given without covenant or condition, land transferred to the ownership of the 
 Parish Council and no obligation to install or maintain equipment. There were a 
 number of Councillors not in favour of taking on the responsibility for any 
 maintenance, ad infinitum, for the POS.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Precept Considerations</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith had offered to provide his home as the venue 
 for the Finance Committee to meet on Friday 5th January 2007 at 8pm to consider 
 the demand on the precept. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After a meeting with Mike Barton GCC PROW, Cllr Stuart had 
 informed the Committee that if it was prepared to precept an amount to defray 
 the cost of a proposed replacement bridge to span the river Churn, it would 
 expedite the completion of the canal tow path cycle route from South Cerney to 
 Siddington. Cllr Squire suggested that the Historic Building fund be recharged. 
 The Parish Council agreed with a proposal from Cllr Smith that the Village Plan 
 be used as a template to decide which special projects are supported. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It had been proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr 
 Nicholas that the Finance Committee recommends to the Parish Council that it 
 would be minded to grant the Cricket Club £2,081 which represents the complete 
 excess of its overspend in refurbishing its pitch subject to funds being 
 available. After a vote 5 (five) members were in favour and 1 (one) against. 
 The motion had been carried at the Monday meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed that the above grant is 
 discussed at the precept meeting.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Parking Notices outside Bridge House</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to write to Mr Genillard, Bridge House, Silver Street 
 informing him that the Parish Council was disappointed that the parking notices 
 outside his house had not been removed as the signs were not considered 
 appropriate within the Conservation Area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Conditions</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas explained to Cllr Parsons (GCC) that some planning conditions 
 imposed by CDC had not been enforced thereby devaluing their intention. Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) will take up the complaint with CDC planning department.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith stated that one of the vehicle activated speed 
 signs was missing. The Clerk reported it had been removed for servicing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce stated that he had met with Mike Barton GCC 
 PROW who informed him that the damaged bridge over the stream, which he had 
 reported as unsound, had been repaired. He informed the Parish Council that 
 there were some walks in the vicinity of Cerney Wick which were permissive and 
 enquired as to how their status could be changed to public rights of way. He 
 was advised to contact the Ramblers Association who would help to alter the 
 status from permissive to definitive paths. The Clerk was asked to report that 
 the sign at Churn Pool, notifying the existence of PROW BSC 22/2, was lying on 
 the ground nearby. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb suggested that a traffic calming scheme be 
 implemented during the resurfacing of Broadway Lane. He asked the Clerk to 
 enquire from Martin Midgeley, Gloucestershire Highways Area Programme Manager 
 as to the outcome of the traffic calming survey. Cllr Parsons (GCC) informed 
 the Parish Council of the difficulty in getting a resurfacing scheme into the 
 capital program. To demand the introduction of a traffic calming scheme now 
 could possibly delay the resurfacing of Broadway Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report that the cover of 
 the water stopcock near Willow Grove was missing and there was damage to the 
 sewer manhole cover in the pavement near the residence known as “Content” in 
 Station Road. The sewer cover outside the Londis shop in Broadway Lane was also 
 damaged. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris requested permission to carry out a tree 
 survey in the village. Cllr Nicholas informed the Parish Council about a recent 
 court decision that it was a duty to have well qualified personnel carry out 
 any such survey. It was agreed that Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb Parish Council 
 Tree Wardens should carry out a tree survey but if there were any instances 
 discovered which were beyond their mandate the Parish Council should not 
 hesitate to arrange for professional guidance. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported on her attendance at the opening 
 event of the South Cerney Play Group’s new building at Berkeley Close. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Pollard informed the Parish Council that she will 
 update the Village Plan in time for the precept meeting and asked Parish 
 Councillors to let her know in the near future, of any progress achieved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had asked the Clerk to report the dumping of 
 rubbish and bits of cars in the laybay off Cirencester Road. The Clerk had 
 informed Gloucestershire Highways but was asked to now inform Roger Sollis at 
 CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) apologised for his prolonged absence 
 from Parish Council meetings and asked assembled Parish Councillors if there 
 were any outstanding problems which he might be able to solve. Cllr Harris 
 complained about the state of the Lakeside car park which he described as 
 disgusting and the industrial bird feeding activities of visitors. Cllr Smith 
 described the speed of traffic on the Spine Road as frightening, accentuated by 
 the lack of carriageway lighting, especially during darkness. Cllr Smith argued 
 that some sort of access is needed for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the 
 carriageway. Cllr Nicholas stated that a proactive traffic planning scheme was 
 needed. Cllr Parsons then went on to explain the situation in relation to the 
 on-going saga of the zebra crossing. As there was no consensus the plans were 
 now back at the consultation stage. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart congratulated Cllr Mrs Chapman on the speech 
 she made at the opening of the South Cerney Play Group’s new building at 
 Berkeley Close. Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to report that there was a willow 
 in danger of collapsing into the Millstream to the Environment Agency.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS CONTRIBUTIONS</b> <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">As there was no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 10.20pm.</p>
