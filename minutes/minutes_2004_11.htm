    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Minutes

    favour. Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Wheel Washing</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would investigate the wheel washing requirements of 
    vehicles leaving sites in the vicinity of Cerney Wick Lane, Spine Road and 
    Station Road and report at the next meeting.<br>
    <b>Bus Service</b><br>
    Cllr Harris requested that an incident be reported to the management of 
    Stagecoach which involved Bus No. 51 at 8.58am on 15th October. This service 
    was 5 to 10 minutes ahead of schedule on the Swindon to Cirencester route 
    and left passengers to await the next service.<br>
    <b>Zebra Crossing/Traffic Speed</b><br>
    The Clerk was to ask J. Whittaker, GCC Highways Traffic Manager, for a 
    response to recent letters.<br>
    <b>Flooding Report</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) confirmed that A. R. Jones Head of Planning at CDC 
    would attend the next flood forum meeting. Cllr Nicholas read letters sent 
    to Mr &amp; Mrs M. Chapman from Fosseway Housing Association, Geoffrey Clifton 
    Brown MP and A. R. Jones (CDC) which purported to reassure them that steps 
    were in hand to reduce the potential for further flooding in the future. The 
    Clerk was asked to pass copies of the letters to Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) and 
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) for their information. The Clerk reported that Cllr 
    Bennett (CDC) had informed him that this week a team from Thames Water plc 
    were surveying pipework with CCTV cameras.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    Over the weekend of 16 to 18 October I attended the SLCC annual conference 
    in Stratford upon Avon. The conference was opened at 2pm on Saturday 
    afternoon by Cllr Juliet Short, Chairman of Stratford on Avon District 
    Council. 250 Clerks from 39 counties in England and Wales were in 
    attendance. The first speaker was Martin Horton of the IDeA (Improvement and 
    development agency) who described his role as creating working relationships 
    between national stakeholders in local government, central government, 
    professional bodies, regulators, academics and elected politicians across 
    all political groups. All very interesting but structured for larger 
    councils. From a choice of topics for the next session I selected a workshop 
    managed by Graham Wilson who is the legal adviser to the SLCC. The most 
    interesting part of this session was the coming introduction of a new model 
    code of conduct for local government employees. There was a lot of 
    opposition from the assembled clerks to its introduction outlined in Clerks 
    &amp; Councils magazine which is now on circulation. The final session of the 
    afternoon was an hour of instruction on how to simplify the keeping of 
    accounts in Microsoft Excel where many useful tips were explained.<br>
    On Sunday morning I attended a forum for part-time clerks. The speaker 
    described the formation of cluster councils to share services. On a smaller 
    scale Parish Councils might share photocopying, stationery or training 
    resources. In the more remote areas of the country clusters were forming by 
    default and was especially evident on the Isle of Wight. One Clerk described 
    how she had involved Parish Councillors by giving each member a portfolio. 
    Portfolios in this Parish Council might consist of Transport, Subsidised 
    local housing, NHS, Water Park or Youth activities. Chairmen of committees 
    would have a portfolio regarding all matters concerned with their 
    committees’ responsibilities. How would Parish Councillors on this Council 
    react to such a proposal? Nick Randle SLCC Chief executive was the main 
    speaker at the next session which informed the conference of the new terms 
    and conditions agreement for Town &amp; Parish Councils that had been agreed 
    with NALC and would be introduced on 1st April 2005. In 1996 it had been 
    agreed that scales would range from 15 to 49. The new agreement would see 
    this extended to scale 57. It remains to be seen what the impact will be on 
    my personal scale. One piece of useful information was that the Local 
    Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 is the one which provides 
    powers regarding sport and recreation. The 1972 Local Government Act Section 
    145 (a) gives power for &quot;the provision of any entertainment of any nature or 
    facilities for dancing&quot;.<br>
    The first session on Monday morning concerned the Freedom of Information Act 
    which comes into force in January 2005. The lecture was given by Mrs Gifford 
    who is an expert advisor to The Lord Chancellor’s Advisory Group on the 
    Implementation of the Freedom of Information. All requests by the public for 
    information must be in writing and the information requested clearly 
    described. From receipt of a valid request 20 days are allowed in which to 
    supply the information. There is a duty to assist the applicant and all 
    assistance must be recorded. There must be a response and embarrassment is 
    no excuse for non-delivery. Responses must either confirm or deny the 
    application. It was advised to robustly adhere to retention and disposable 
    schedules. For example email communications should only be kept 
    electronically for two weeks and a hard copy made if it is required to keep 
    them for longer. There are very few exemptions allowed and usually apply to 
    Central Government only. The closing speaker was the Chief Constable of 
    Warwickshire who gave an informative lecture on the perceived success of the 
    national reduction in crime figures.<br>
    Overall I found the conference experience very rewarding and informative.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Nicholas that the 
    portfolio idea be made an agenda item for next month’s meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Due to the absence of Cllr Squire, Cllr Stuart reported on the deliberations 
    of this committee which had met on Monday 8th November.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up Play Area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had with George Taylor from The Play 
    Service and arranged for him to give specifications and quotations to 
    refurbish the existing equipment. The Committee had agreed to a 
    recommendation from Mr Taylor that the “hand hold” climbing arrangement 
    which gives access to the tower slide be replaced with a staircase. Cllr 
    Harris had scrutinised the specifications and quotations to replace the 
    safety surface and reported that he wished to research the matter further. 
    For example, how would it work in shady areas and was it vandal proof? He 
    would enquire from the suppliers if another established installation could 
    be inspected. Cllr Jay suggested that testimonials from satisfied customers 
    should be sought.<br>
    Cllr Stuart confirmed that the grafitti on the Activities Centre had been 
    painted out.<br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the broken rail from the car park fence had been 
    replaced.<br>
    <b>Tree Planting Scheme</b><br>
    The Committee had met and would now implement the tree planting scheme 
    designed by Whitton Associates. Plans were on going and 50-60 trees were now 
    available. A price list of available species would be published in the 
    Cerney News early in the new year.<br>
    <b>Public Seat</b><br>
    GCC Highways had not raised any objections to a public seat being positioned 
    on the grass verge on the northern side of the entrance to the parade of 
    shops in Clarks Hay. The installer should pay particular attention to avoid 
    damage to any services which may be beneath the surface.<br>
    <b>Official Opening of Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Plans were made to provide sustenance and shelter for invited guests at the 
    opening of the refurbished play area. Guests have been invited to attend the 
    play area at 3pm on Saturday November 13. The Press has been informed and a 
    photographer from the Wilts and Glos Standard will be in attendance. Finance 
    for the festivities would be provided under the 1972 Local Government Act, 
    Section 145 (a) which gives powers for “the provision of any entertainment 
    of any nature” and the 1976 Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 
    which provides powers regarding sport and recreation.<br>
    <b>Bow Wow Bridge</b><br>
    Phil Cluley had informed Cllr Stuart that work would begin on the Bow Wow 
    footbridge at Lower Milland associated ramp for disabled users in 4 to 6 
    weeks time. Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that Phil Cluley would 
    be leaving as PROW officer for this area and he will introduce his 
    replacement in due course. The Clerk was asked to write to Mr Cluley 
    expressing this Parish Council’s massive appreciation for the years of 
    first-rate service he had given to South Cerney through his position as PROW 
    Officer at GCC.<br>
    <b>River Churn</b><br>
    Mr Blacker, Environment Agency, had inspected the damage caused by 
    contractors and thanked Cllr Stuart for reporting the incident.<br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had forwarded an email quotation he had received from Solagen, 
    suppliers of solar powered interactive speed signs. The Parish Council 
    agreed that at approximately £4,000 plus VAT each, not including post or 
    installation, further quotations should be researched.<br>
    <b>Chestnut Mews Wall</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had asked the Clerk to enquire if the wall in the course of 
    construction needed planning permission. The Enforcement Officer at CDC had 
    inspected the wall and decided that no permission was necessary so long as 
    the wall did not exceed 1 metre in height.<br>
    <b>Station Road Ditch</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had surveyed the ditch and concluded that no action was needed 
    at the moment to clear the silt. Cllr Harris volunteered to remove some 
    timber branches from the ditch.<br>
    <b>Aggregate Industries</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that residents had complained about the noise emanating 
    from Aggregate Industries site at 6.30am. Cllr Squire was liaising with Mr 
    R. Brassington, CDC Noise Abatement Officer and would report the incident to 
    him. The Clerk was asked to get clarification of the planning permission 
    conditions.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that all equipment was in working order. He reminded 
    the Committee that parking bays for the disabled must be created on the car 
    park to comply with the Disability and Discrimination Act. Cllr Stuart 
    volunteered to get some quotations from the provision of the parking bays 
    and the Committee also agreed to include the scheme in its budget proposals. 
    Due to the mild weather the Committee agreed to recommend to the Parish 
    Council that a further grass cut be made.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had replaced a plank on the train unit and extra bolts had been 
    fitted. The bridge parapet was still in need of repair, the bridlepath 
    barrier had not been replaced and the overgrowing shrubs alongside Ash Moon 
    had not been cut back. The Clerk was asked to remind GCC Highways and 
    Cotswold Waterpark Rangers of this outstanding work.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce had informed the Clerk that all outstanding jobs had been 
    completed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Due to the absence of Cllr Smith, Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of 
    this committee which had met on Monday 8th November.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>South Cerney Play Group</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs F. Chapman declared a prejudicial interest as a Trustee of the 
    group and left the meeting.<br>
    South Cerney Play Group had written to request that the Parish Council 
    consider financial help with its building project. The Clerk informed the 
    Committee that under Section 137 funds could be allocated for community 
    projects. Currently £5.15 per elector could be legitimately used for such 
    schemes. The Electoral Office at CDC had confirmed today that there are 
    2,454 electors on the roll for South Cerney. In last year’s budget £1,300 
    had been agreed as Section 137 funding. Cllr Nicholas said that there should 
    be a consensus of opinion on how much the Parish Council would agree to 
    donate to the Play Group in its budget precept. Cllr Jay was of the opinion 
    that the increase in Council Tax discount on holiday homes from 50% to 10% 
    would reduce the average band “D” charge for home owners in the Parish 
    thereby making any increase in the Parish Precept that much less of a 
    burden. Cllr M. Baines (CDC) agreed to enquire from the Cotswold District 
    Council on how the extra Council Tax collected on holiday homes will impact 
    on the precept and how many properties contribute to the Council Tax in the 
    Parish. Various donation amounts were put forward and one Parish Councillor 
    was undecided on how much. No decision was reached on an exact amount which 
    should be included in the precept although Parish Councillors were minded to 
    make a donation to the Play Group. The Clerk was asked to inform the Play 
    Group of this debate.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman rejoined the debate.<br>
    <b>Royal British Legion</b><br>
    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart agreed to make a donation of £50 from his 
    Chairman’s allowance to the Royal British Legion for providing the 
    Remembrance Day wreath.<br>
    <b>Village Directory</b><br>
    In March 2004 the Editor of Cerney News had asked the Parish Council to 
    consider a donation of £150 towards the production of the Village Directory. 
    As work was soon to start on its production the Parish Council had been 
    asked to make its donation. The annual budget allowed £100 for the Cerney 
    News and Village Directory to be paid at 2 yearly intervals. It was proposed 
    by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Parish Council make 
    a contribution of £150 towards the production of the Village Directory. The 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on Monday 8th November.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Letter to A. R. Jones (CDC)</b><br>
    No reply had been received to the letter querying how the Parish Council 
    could determine applications when decisions on nature, texture and colour of 
    materials to be used is unknown.<br>
    <b>Jubilee Gardens Public Art</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked that the Clerk inform Rachael Stanway, CDC Arts 
    Development Officer of the Parish Council’s disappointment that no action 
    had been taken due to lack of funding and invite her to inform the Parish 
    Council of the grant applications in time for its December meeting. He said 
    we were led to believe at the February meeting that funds were in fact 
    available and it was only the format of the art which had to be decided.<br>
    <b>Planning Applications available on CDC Web Site</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas informed the meeting that CDC was to be congratulated as

    <b>VILLAGE PLAN</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart thanked everyone who had turned out on Saturday 6th November to 
    help with the deliberations of residents’ views on what should be included 
    in the Village Plan. Cllr Stuart reported that more than fifty residents 
    attended throughout the day. Residents’ comments will now be analysed in 
    conjunction with the existing plan and a new action plan developed. The 
    majority of comments referred to traffic, parking and speed through the 
    village. The Clerk was asked to thank Dr Stephenson for his letter and ask 
    him if he would be prepared to join a sub committee to manage traffic 
    problems in the village. A youth council was another possibility which could 
    be discussed. The Clerk was asked to invite a GCC Youth Service Manager to 
    explain how money is allocated throughout the county for the benefit of the 
    youth. A meeting has been arranged with Melanie Tarrant, GRCC South 
    Cotswolds Rural Adviser and Cllr Stuart encouraged those Parish Councillors 
    available to attend the Village Hall at 2.30pm on Tuesday 16th November.<br>

    appearance of the proposed dwelling should be shown in detailed plans before 
    approval can reasonably be given<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the

    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
