    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30pm<p><b>
    APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas had made an apology for his absence due to a business 
    commitment. Cllr Smith had apologised for his absence due to personal 
    reasons. Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) had also made an apology.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 8th JUNE 2005</b><br>
    Page 1977: Third paragraph – change Ms Jenny Silver, to read ... &quot;Ms Jenni 
    Silver,&quot;<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. Besides Cllr Jay and 
    Cllr Mrs Pollard who abstained as they had not attended the meeting, the 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Youth Service</b><br>
    Cllr Jay was critical of the replies that the Youth Service representative, 
    Helen Briggs, had given him when he discussed the needs of South Cerney 
    youth with her at the Village Plan open event. According to the Youth 
    Services representative the inaction was due to lack of funds. Cllr Jay 
    referred to a recent article in the Wilts &amp; Glos Standard which reported 
    that the youth in Fairford had been successful in attaining funding probably 
    because they had a representative of the Youth Service closely involved with 
    local organisations. He hoped that when the Youth Service came to present 
    the results of their needs analysis to the Parish Council a member of the 
    Youth Service would have specific responsibility for the youth of South 
    Cerney. Helen Briggs, Youth Service supervisor at Cirencester will be unable 
    to attend the August meeting as she will be involved with an international 
    youth exchange but will come to the following meeting scheduled for 14th 
    September.<br>
    <b>Community Charge Grant</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) refuted the allegation that she meant to infer that the 
    Parish Council was negligent in not applying for a grant from the extra 
    income generated through the reduction in discount from 50% to 10%. Cllr 
    Webb asserted that this is what her statement had inferred. Both Councillors 
    agreed to differ in their interpretation. Cllr Stuart asked that the three 
    District Councillors present keep the Parish Council informed when the next 
    round of applications to the fund becomes appropriate.<br>
    <b>Ashton Keynes Parish Council Support</b><br>
    Ashton Keynes Parish Council had copied a letter they had sent to HM 
    Coroner's Office in which it supported South Cerney Parish Council's concern 
    of the accumulation of mud, dust and other debris on the Spine Road East 
    (B4696).<br>
    <b>Lakeside Car Park</b><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform Cotswold Water Park Society that the pot holes 
    on the surface of Lakeside Car Park, opposite Spring Lakes, urgently needed 
    attention.<br>
    <b>Vandalism at Upper Up</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that at 8.30am this morning a memorial tree was 
    uprooted and used to fuel a fire on the cricket outfield. Cllr Stuart 
    informed the Police that there were four persons, acting suspiciously in the 
    vicinity, who might have been responsible but the Police receptionist would 
    not issue a crime number and up to now there had been no further contact 
    with the Constabulary. Cllr Stuart recommended that the Clerk write to Chief 
    Superintendent John Henry and remind him of his commitment made at the 
    Annual Parish Meeting that his officers would respond and express the 
    disappointment of the Parish Council that they did not in this instance. The 
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard reported that she had broad consent from members of the 
    Village Plan sub committee to meet on 3rd August at 7pm. The Open Evening 
    had attracted in excess of 80 residents and their comments now needed to be 
    analysed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK'S REPORT</b><br>
    On Thursday 23rd June I attended a presentation which was made to a panel of 
    two inspectors from the Village of the Year competition. Cllr Harris, Cllr 
    Jay, Cllr Mrs Pollard, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart were also in attendance. 
    Cllr Jay lead the presentation with a computer generated slide show which 
    explained the aims and purposes of the people of South Cerney. In the 
    evening I returned to take part in the Open Forum organised by the Village 
    Plan Sub Committee. I will be on holiday from 18th to 29th July inclusive 
    and I have made arrangements that Planning mail will be redirected to Cllr 
    Nicholas during my absence. During May I averaged 2 hours 40 minutes per 
    available working day. This is 50 minutes less per day than my contract 
    allows.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING FROM ANNUAL PARISH MEETING</b><br>
    The Chairman agreed that this item be discussed at next month's meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village 
    Maintenance<br>
    Committee which had met on 11th July.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Highway Matters</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that John Whittaker (GCC Highways) had informed him that 
    because of an objection by Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) regarding the change in the 
    speed limits on the Preston Toll Bar to South Cerney road further 
    consultation would be necessary. Cllr Bennett (CDC) explained that the 
    Forward Planning section at CDC had asked him to comment on the 
    implementation of the new speed limits. He was not in favour of multiple 
    speed limits on this 'B' Class road primarily because of the difficulty in 
    policing the limit. Further consultations would now be necessary before the 
    limits could be considered for alteration and delay to the project was 
    inevitable. Similarly, Mr Whittaker confirmed that consultations were 
    on-going with regard to the siting of the pedestrian crossing. The 
    interactive signs had not been installed because Mr Whittaker was unsure as 
    to whether the Parish Council had been successful in its grant application. 
    The Clerk explained that although the grant from CDC was 50% lower than 
    applied for, the Parish Council had agreed to make good the shortfall to a 
    maximum of £6,000. It had been understood from previous meetings with Mr 
    Whittaker that GCC Highways would meet the rest of the costs from its 
    budget.<br>
    <b>Pathway South Cerney/Siddington/Cirencester</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had received an email from Neville Holder of the Canal Trust 
    informing him that Siddington Parish Council had given &quot;guarded support&quot; to 
    the creation of a pathway and enquired whether there was sufficient demand 
    for a cycle path. Cllr Stuart referred to the 1999 Village Appraisal which 
    stated that 899 were in favour whilst 49 were against a pathway/cycleway 
    between South Cerney, Cirencester and Deer Park school. This he argued showed 
    that there was substantial support in South Cerney for such a scheme.<br>
    <b>Churchyard Headstones</b><br>
    Cllr Squire pointed out that the ecclesiastical insurers would pay for the 
    laying flat of any headstones which were considered dangerously misaligned 
    and not the cost of realigning them.<br>
    <b>Weed Clearance on Upper Up pathway</b><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Harris that a verbal 
    quote from Adrian Gibbs to spray the weeds for £50 be accepted. The 
    Committee agreed.<br>
    <b>360 degree swing at Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    As no report was as yet forthcoming on the loose state of the 360 degree 
    A-frame from Steve Griffiths of Macventure Play Company the Clerk was asked 
    to make further enquiries.<br>
    <b>Missing Spindle on apparatus at Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Ian Fairbrother had informed the Clerk that he would make the repair to the 
    apparatus on Friday 15th July.</p>
    <p><b>Village of the Year</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Committee that judging of the Calor Gas Village of 
    the Year had taken place on 23rd June. The awards presentation for 
    Gloucestershire was scheduled for 20th July. Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Pollard and 
    Cllr Stuart agreed to attend.<br>
    <b>Bledisloe Plate</b><br>
    Judging of entrants in the Bledisloe Plate competition will take place from 
    9th July to 24th July. Cllr Stuart prepared a list of village achievements 
    over the past year which was forwarded to the judges.<br>
    <b>Advertising Signs</b><br>
    Michael Grace (CDC Enforcement Officer) had informed the Clerk that through 
    his intervention an application had been made for an advertising hoarding at 
    the Spine Road, Station Road, Cerney Wick lane cross roads. It remains to be 
    seen whether or not the application is successful.<br>
    <b>Barrier on old railway track</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the barrier had still not been erected. Cllr 
    Stuart recommended that if the work had not been completed by the August 
    Parish Council meeting then a reminder be sent to the Cotswold Water Park 
    Society.<br>
    <b>War Memorial &amp; Preaching Cross</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that Allianz Comhill had quoted £86.52 inc tax to add the 
    War Memorial and the Preaching Cross (ancient monument) to the insurance 
    policy based on a rebuilding cost of £4,000 for each. This would provide 
    cover against malicious damage, impact and public liability. Cllr Squire had 
    been informed by English Heritage that the Parish Council owned the said 
    cross. Cllr Squire would ask GCC Highways if it was prepared to make a 
    donation towards its refurbishment as vehicles using the roads in the 
    vicinity of the cross and recent work to widen the paved footpath had 
    undoubtedly been partly responsible for its current condition. It was 
    proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the extra insurance at a 
    cost of £86.52 be added to the schedule. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    <b>Jubilee Gardens</b><br>
    Allianz Cornhill informed the Clerk that the public space in Jubilee 
    Gardens, along with its furniture, would automatically be included in the 
    overall insurance schedule at no extra cost. The Parish Council would be 
    responsible to make a weekly inspection of the furniture. Cllr Stuart 
    reported that grass in the area had not yet been cut this season and it was 
    all looking very untidy. In conversation with Alex Fraser, designer of the 
    open space community art, he enquired if a commuted sum could be raised to 
    help pay for future ground maintenance. Martin Hutchings (CDC) had told Mr 
    Fraser that there was no commuted sum available. Cllr Stuart suggested that 
    the Parish Council might be minded to purchase the public area for a nominal 
    sum. Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC) will enquire who 
    might be approached at Cotswold District Council to negotiate the purchase 
    or transfer of the land.<br>
    <b>Bow Wow street light</b><br>
    Barry Greenaway (GCC Lighting) informed Cllr Stuart that he now had the 
    specification for the electricity company to erect a light near the bridge 
    in Bow Wow and he was minded to do so before winter.<br>
    <b>Bus Shelter</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the Community Services work party had painted the 
    interior of the bus shelter.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the fireman's pole attachment on the Activity Area 
    had snapped off and needed to be welded back. Cllr Stuart volunteered to 
    contact the metal working company in Broadway Lane who might be able to make 
    a suitable repair. The Clerk had been in contact with A. Gibbs who quoted 
    £130 plus VAT to strim the herbage on Upper Up cycle mounds.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish 
    Council agrees to pay £130 plus VAT to A. Gibbs to do the said strimming. 
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Two oaks appear dead and a third is only just breaking bud. Cllr Stuart 
    declared a prejudicial interest as a member of the Bowls Club in the next 
    item when he suggested that the Committee agree to a donation to the Bowls 
    Club for the use of their watering pump.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council agrees to<br>
    make a donation of £25 to the Bowls Club. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris noted that the recently sprayed pyracantha was resprouting and 
    asked the Clerk to report the fact to the contractors Tree Maintenance Ltd. 
    The Clerk had contacted the contractors who would re-spray the pyracantha 
    today. On the Toddler Swing one seat was bent out of shape. The spindle on 
    the Tower Slide Unit was still missing. The bridge parapets had been 
    repaired.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order.<br>
    <br>
    <b>SAFETY TILES</b><br>
    George Taylor had written to confirm that his previous quotations would be 
    5% higher if the Parish Council agrees to go ahead. If the Parish Council 
    instructs work to begin at its next meeting then Mr Taylor envisages 
    commencement in early September. Cllr Stuart would liaise with the Community 
    Service who agreed, as a general principle, to lift the tiles. Cllr Squire 
    had contacted the Environment Agency which informed him that the tiles could 
    be treated as non-hazardous waste and dumped on any land fill site. Cllr 
    Squire would liaise with Hills to accept their disposal.<br>
    <br>
    <b>BUS SHELTER</b><br>
    Cllr Squire will work with Cllr Mrs Chubb to locate a source of possible 
    funding for a bus<br>
    shelter and if feasible the scheme could be included in next year's budget.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CORRESPONDENCE</b><br>
    Mrs Gardner of Station Road had written to complain about the weeds growing 
    in the Station Road ditch. Cllr Mrs Chubb maintained that there were rats in 
    the ditch. Cllr Harris argued that the herbage provided an excellent habitat 
    for wildlife which should be left as in other seasons and strimmed in late 
    autumn. Cllr Squire agreed with Cllr Mrs Chubb that it was very untidy. Cllr 
    Harris informed Cllr Mrs Chubb that under Health and Safety rules it was no 
    longer acceptable that strimmers be used on sloping banks. The strimming 
    apparatus is now on a harness around the operator's waist which did not 
    permit the strimmer's use outside of a horizontal plane. The Committee 
    agreed to a recommendation from Cllr Stuart that signs be placed on the 
    village notice boards explaining the reason for the herbage growth in the 
    ditch and an article which Cllr Harris volunteered to compose submitted to 
    the Cerney News. Cllr Mrs Chubb was also concerned that the ditch bank was 
    showing signs of erosion in the vicinity of a recently moved telegraph pole. 
    Cllr Harris would investigate. The Committee agreed to include the cost of 
    de-silting the ditch in next year's budget proposals.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the growth 
    in the ditch is cut as per schedule in late autumn. Eight Parish Councillors 
    were in favour and one against.<br>
    The motion was therefore carried.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce requested that the Clerk write to Mr Tim Pain to express his 
    appreciation for the prompt attention provided by Ali Swainston to damage 
    inflicted to his property by the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd when 
    strimming the public right of way to the rear of his house in Cerney Wick 
    while carrying out work requested by the Parish Council.<br>
    Cllr Harris noted that the bridle path to the rear of Lakeside and the path 
    from Station Road to the Spine Road needed to be cleared of overgrowth. The 
    Clerk would inform Cotswold Water Park Society.<br>
    Cllr Harris recommended that the trees in Clarks Hay are watered and the 
    dead ones removed. Cllr Squire will investigate.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard proposed and Cllr Caunce seconded a motion that the tree 
    scheme is repeated next year and the dead trees replaced at the expense of 
    the Parish Council. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that her husband had cleared the pathway from 
    Station Road to Bow Wow but there was an overgrowing rose tree along the 
    path. The Clerk requested that Cllr Mrs Chubb inform him of the address to 
    which the tree belongs.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported that weed in the river Churn through Bow Wow was 
    preventing rubbish being taken down stream. The Clerk would inform the 
    Environment Agency.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had 
    met on 11th July.<br>
    Grass Cutting Grass cutting cuts for this current year and those of last 
    year. Please note that the VAT element is inconsistent as some contractors 
    are registered and others are not.</p>

    <br>
    <b>CT.2475/1/X</b><br>
    Erection of thirty seven (37) industrial units of various sizes, associated 
    parking and car park at rear (reserved matters for application CT.2475/1/L) 
    on land at Evergreen Industrial Estate, Broadway Lane, South Cerney<br>
    Reason: The application site forms part of an industrial development and is 
    located within the Cotswold Water Park at the edge of the settlement of 
    South Cerney, and is bordered by a Public Right of Way along its northern 
    boundary. Due to their siting, massing, scale and design, the proposed 
    buildings would be highly intrusive and harmful from public viewpoints to 
    the character and appearance of the application site and of its wider 
    village- edge setting, and would fail to preserve or enhance the locality. 
    Consequently, the proposals would fail to accord with government guidance 
    within PPS1, PPG4 and PPS7, Gloucestershire Structure Plan Second Review 
    Policies S4, S6, S7 and E2, and Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 32, 
    40 and Water Park Policy 8.1.<br>
    Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to enquire from the Planning Department at CDC 
    where exactly were the public viewpoints referred to in the refusal notice.
    <br>

    <b>CT.3578/J </b><br>

    <b>Correspondence </b><br>
    CDC - CT.6460/G: Appeal upheld regarding land to the rear of 17-22 The Leaze, 
    South Cerney<br>
    Reasons to note: 11. The Inspector acknowledged the strong pattern of 
    frontage development formed by the dwellings in both The Leaze and Broadway 
    Lane, but felt that the presence of the rear development in Beverstone 
    Road/Close and Oak Way is sufficiently prominent in the local street scene 
    to give a varied feel to the character of the area, with which the proposal 
    would blend well. He accepted that these existing rear developments are of a 
    different scale and pattern from the proposal, but considered that these 
    differences would not be readily apparent when seen from Broadway Lane and 
    The Leaze. Whilst the flats at 17-22 The Leaze are visually similar to 
    houses in the area, the layout, with an access leading to a rear parking 
    courtyard, is dissimilar to the housing layout elsewhere, and this also adds 
    to the diversity of character in the area. He considered that the proposal 
    would not emulate the existing form of development in the area, but would be 
    in sympathy with it, and thus would comply with Policy 1 of the Local Plan.<br>
    21. The Inspector was told by residents of concerns about flood risk and 
    sewerage, but noted that there are no objections from statutory consultees. 
    In his opinion, non-specific anecdotal evidence gives insufficient reason to 
    dismiss the appeal on these grounds. The need to keep the access clear might 
    restrict parking in the courtyard, but in his view there is sufficient 
    parking space in the existing garages and in front of them to serve the 
    likely needs of the existing occupiers of the flats.<br>
    <br>
    <b>FLOOD FORUM REPORT</b><br>
    The Chairman agreed to a request from Cllr Nicholas, who could not attend 
    this Parish Council meeting, that this item is held over until next month's 
    meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS' PORTFOLIO REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire was investigating a scheme to relieve congestion at Londis and 
    would report to the Parish Council his progress at a later date. <br>
    The Parish Council agreed with a suggestion from Cllr Jay that the first aid 
    training provided by St John Ambulance Brigade be published in the Cerney 
    News. <br>

    <p><b>Item No 4</b><br>
    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart read the correspondence which dealt with 
    allegations by the 15th Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon made to the 
    Standards Board for England that he believed his democratic rights had been 
    eroded and that Cllr Stuart had discriminated against him.<br>
    The Standards Board rejected the complainant's allegations and (even if they 
    were found to have occurred) would not have involved any failure to comply 
    with the authority's Code of Conduct and should not be investigated. Earlier 
    today, Cllr Stuart had contacted the Standards Board which informed him that 
    the Marquis de Derval et de Moisdon had appealed against the decision but 
    this had also been rejected. Cllr Jay said the behaviour of Marquis de 
    Derval et de Moisdon was contemptible and this Parish Council supports its 
    Chairman, Cllr Stuart. Cllr Caunce proposed and Cllr Mrs Chapman seconded a 
    motion that this Parish Council totally supports the actions of the 
    Chairman, Cllr Stuart. The Parish Council agreed unanimously.<br>
    <b>Item No 9</b><br>
    This item concerned the impact of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment 
    Act 2005 on the Parish Council. This Act especially relates to the newly 
    granted right of Parish Councils to appoint Parish Wardens to police the 
    community. The Parish Council decided to refer this subject to the Village 
    Plan sub committee and suggested that it be included in the draft Village 
    Plan.<br>
    <b>Item No 17</b><br>
    This correspondence was a copy of a letter from Mr R. Brassington, Principal 
    Environmental<br>
    Health Officer CDC to HQ Land Command (Army) registering complaints from 
    &quot;local residents and a Parish Council&quot; regarding aircraft activity 
    associated with parachute jumping at the Duke of Gloucester Barracks. Cllr 
    Mrs Clark (CDC) had directly criticised Mr Brassington for writing the letter 
    and objected to its content. She had insisted that it was the MoD which will 
    decide any outcome. Cllr Jay said, that as the Duke of Gloucester Barracks 
    was part of this Parish, this Parish Council was most closely related to its 
    activities. The Parish Council had discussed aircraft activity and parachute 
    jumping on numerous occasions. The authorities at the Barracks kept 
    residents informed of forthcoming flying activities and were most 
    accommodating. It was proposed by Cllr Squire and seconded by Cllr Jay that 
    the Clerk writes to HQ Land Command in support of the activities at the Duke 
    of Gloucester Barracks and copy the letter to Mr Brassington. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b><br>
    Cllr Jay reported that the Millennium seat in Bow Wow had been damaged and 
    the Clerk was to ask Andy Beard to repair it.<br>
    Cllr Jay reported on a Licence Seminar he and Cllr Stuart had attended at 
    CDC. The new rules, he said, were quite complicated and tricky to 
    understand. He endeavoured to explain the implications these rules would 
    have on future events, which involved the provision of alcohol, at the 
    Village Hall.<br>
    Cllr Webb asked the Clerk to notify Ian Kennedy if he would cut back the 
    brambles outside the Scout Hut in Berkeley Close.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the signpost warning motorists, outside 
    Oklahoma, Cerney Wick had been knocked over and should be re-erected. She 
    also asked that the Clerk inform GCC Highways that hedges on the south side 
    of the bridge over the old railway line in Cerney Wick were over grown and 
    should be cut back.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business, Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 9.50pm.</td>
