    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Minutes as 
    altered were a true and accurate record. With the exception of Cllr Smith 
    who abstained, as he did not attend the original meeting, the Parish Council 
    was all in favour. Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>EXTERNAL AUDITORS QUERIES</b><br>
    Mrs J. Gardiner who is contracted by the Parish Council to carry out the 
    Internal Audit reported the action she proposed be taken to answer various 
    queries on the Annual Return. Andrew Vince from Moore Stephens Chartered 
    Accountants (External Auditors) had asked for an explanation as required by 
    paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 on the back of the Annual Return for the variances in 
    boxes 3, 4, 6 &amp; 7. Accordingly: Box 3 – Income Minus Precept was due to a 
    Section 106 payment of £13,000 in year 2003 as a one-off receipt; Box 4 – 
    “Staff Costs“ was due to the Clerk’s promotion to Scale 20 and an increase 
    in his hours from 15 to 18 per week; Box 6 – “Total Other Payments“ was due 
    to improvements to the Village Hall and Upper Up play area which was 
    financed through accumulated reserve funds specially set aside for the 
    projects; Box 7 – Bank Reconciliation now has the Petty Cash included; Box 8 
    – Difference equals Debtors due to a VAT repayment of £3,940.34 expected and 
    water rate repayments from playing field use of £14.70 expected. It was 
    proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the replies to 
    the Auditor’s queries were a true and accurate explanation. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour. The Chairman and Clerk both signed the letter of 
    explanation and the Clerk will inform the Auditors.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Play Group Donation Request</b><br>
    Mrs J. Gardiner asked for permission to address the Parish Council on a 
    separate matter. The Vice Chairman, Cllr Squire approved in the absence of 
    the Chairman who was temporarily absent from the debate. Mrs Gardiner, on 
    behalf of the South Cerney Play Group, requested that the Parish Council 
    considers making a further donation to the Play Group’s funds to help 
    finance its building project. Cllr Nicholas asked that the Play Group send 
    an informative letter to the Parish Council to explain its request. The 
    Parish Council could then determine its response. Mrs Gardiner would inform 
    the group.<br>
    <br>
    <b>SEWAGE AND SURFACE WATER PROBLEMS IN SOUTH CERNEY</b><br>
    The Chairman suggested that item 9 on the Agenda be promoted as Mr Michael 
    Chapman was in attendance and wished to join in the debate. The Parish 
    Council was in agreement.<br>
    Mr M. Chapman made a statement on the recent history of flooding in the 
    Berkeley Close area of the village and the lack of action by the principal 
    authorities since the event. Cllr Bennett (CDC) reported on a meeting of the 
    Cotswold Flooding Forum he had attended on 17th September with members of 
    Thames Water, the Environment Agency and other interested parties. Cllr 
    Bennett (CDC) complained that at each meeting there was a different Thames 
    Water representative present which upset the continuity of the debate. Cllr 
    Mrs Clark (CDC) who was also present had asked what action had been taken to 
    resolve the flooding situation and could the existing sewerage network cope 
    with the additional flows generated by new development. Mr Lawrence Adams, 
    Thames Water representative, whose organisation Cllr Bennett referred to as 
    “Talk Without Action”, said that the report was not yet concluded. As a 
    result of the relatively flat nature of the area, the gradient of the sewers 
    tended to be very flat, resulting in siltation. Infiltration of ground water 
    into the sewers had also been identified as a serious problem. There were 
    several private pumping stations within the catchment that discharge to and 
    possibly contribute towards the problem. It was now apparent that if both 
    the Thames Water owned stations, serving Redlands and Berkeley Close, pump 
    at the same time, the resulting flow exceeds the capacity of the gravity 
    sewer in Broadway Lane, into which they discharge. Cllr Bennett suggested 
    that action should therefore be taken to prevent simultaneous pumping. Mr 
    Adams continued, that as far as could be ascertained, there were no issues 
    with regard to the capacity of the village’s main pumping station at Robert 
    Franklin Way. The next stage in Thames Water’s investigations were: (i) 
    ascertain flow characteristics for both private and Thames controlled 
    pumping stations and (ii) at the appropriate time, when ground water is 
    sufficiently high, complete the extended infiltration study. It may well be 
    that, due to the depth of sewers and the ground water level, some form of 
    lining process will be necessary, should infiltration so dictate. It was 
    anticipated that the extended study would take approximately two months. 
    However, decisions had to be made regarding the appropriate testing to be 
    undertaken which had cost implications. Cllr Bennett (CDC) requested that 
    answers should be available for their November meeting.<br>
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) continued, that A. R. Jones (CDC Head of Planning) had 
    pointed out both Thames Water and the Environment Agency, as consultees in 
    the Planning process, should comment on the Berkeley Close applications but 
    neither had raised any issues. If problems exist, it is imperative that 
    these be brought to the attention of the planners, as the information is 
    needed in order to highlight/support reasons for refusals. Only on the 
    advice of Thames Water could development be refused on foul drainage 
    grounds, assuming that the public sewerage system is the stated method of 
    foul sewage disposal. Thames Water was urged to review its comments on the 
    Berkeley Close applications, as the original “NO ISSUE” response was 
    considered to be totally unacceptable. CDC would provide a list of planning 
    applications within the South Cerney catchment area to Thames Water and ask 
    for informed comments.<br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the Clerk write to Mr Jones and request that 
    CDC does not grant permission for the Berkeley Close application by Bloor 
    Homes Ltd until Thames Water produce its report. Also that another letter to 
    Thames Water requesting that a Senior Executive is present at the next 
    meeting of the Flooding Forum and copy it to Fairford Town Council. The 
    Parish Council agreed with a suggestion from Cllr Nicholas who asked that a 
    letter be sent to Fosseway Housing to enquire why they had not yet updated 
    their sewage system, what action they had taken since the floods in 2001 and 
    to explain why Thames Water refuses to adopt its system. Copies of all 
    correspondence should go to Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, all CDC Water Park 
    Councillors, Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) and Mr &amp; Mrs Chapman.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Zebra Crossing</b><br>
    There was uncertainty whether Mr Whittaker had received letters informing 
    him that the Parish Council had voted in favour of the installation of a 
    zebra crossing. The Clerk was asked to copy the correspondence to him again 
    and also to include Mrs J. Roberts, Meadow Way as an information addressee.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Traffic Speed on Cirencester Road</b><br>
    Mrs M. Roberts of Cirencester Road had forwarded copy correspondence from 
    Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and GCC Highways regarding the difficulties of 
    creating a lower speed limit area on that road. The Clerk was asked to 
    inform Mr Whittaker at GCC Highways that the Parish Council would also be 
    interested in any plans he might have for the road.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    In September I averaged 6 hrs 20 mins per available day. This average, which 
    is nearly double my contracted hours, is partially explained because I do 
    not count weekend work as available work days. When I take a holiday it 
    increases the amount of work time when I return as the post, emails and 
    telephone still operate regardless of my absence. On the evening of 
    Wednesday 6th October I visited Christopher Rowles to discuss a quotation 
    regarding my invitation to quote to carry out the Internal Audit. Although 
    he was not competitive in comparison with the current arrangement, his fees 
    would not be prohibitive. On the 7th October I visited Mrs Gardiner 
    (Internal Auditor) to discuss a response to the queries raised by Andrew 
    Vince (External Auditor) on our recent audit return. Mrs Gardiner agreed to 
    explain the position to this Parish Council meeting. This coming weekend I 
    will be attending the annual SLCC conference in Stratford upon Avon on the 
    16/17/18. As usual I will give a report of the proceedings at next month’s 
    Parish Council meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village 
    Maintenance Committee which had met on Monday 11 October.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Ham Lane/Sudeley Drive Ramp</b><br>
    Taking into account the various obstacles to instal a ramp that GCC Highways 
    had pointed out, the Committee recommends that no further action by taken. 
    The Parish Council was in agreement.<br>
    <b>Footpath Work at Church Lane/Bow Wow</b><br>
    Although Cllr Squire reported that Phil Cluley (GCC PROW) had assured him 
    that the work to complete the project was in hand, the Committee asked the 
    Clerk to request him to complete the job.<br>
    <b>Upper Up Tower Slide</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart will email GPFA for an update on how to redesign the access to 
    the apparatus.<br>
    <b>Police</b><br>
    Inspector Jacka, Gloucestershire Constabulary had explained to the Clerk 
    that he would not be able to attend a meeting of Parish Councillors on any 
    of the dates provided due to his operational duties. He would, however, ask 
    Sgt Steve Templeton to attend the meetings scheduled for 8 December.<br>
    <b>Bledisloe Cup</b><br>
    The presentation of the Bledisloe Cup for the Best Kept Large Village in 
    Gloucestershire took place on Saturday 25 September at 2pm. Cllr Stuart 
    displayed the trophy throughout the remainder of the meeting.<br>
    <b>Tree Seminar</b><br>
    Cllr Harris volunteered to be Tree Warden for the Parish Council. Cllr Webb 
    agreed to be his deputy. The Parish Council was in full agreement.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris had replaced two planks of the old tower slide which had been 
    damaged. The fence along Lakeside had been replaced.<br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that a minor amount of grafitti had been painted on to 
    the wood of the Activities Centre. The Clerk had purchased a small spray can 
    of black paint which will be used to cover the message. One of the bottom 
    rails surrounding the car park had been smashed. Cllr Harris volunteered to 
    replace it. The Parish Council agreed to purchase the replacement rail. Cllr 
    Stuart had cleared up broken glass in the vicinity of the play apparatus and 
    removed two further empty vodka bottles.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce had carried out the inspections at Cerney Wick. The spring 
    closing device on the gate had not yet been repaired. The bin had not been 
    emptied.<br>
    <b>Wildmoorway Bridge (Wilmer Bridge)</b><br>
    Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform the Ranger Service at Cotswold Water 
    Park that the overgrowing branches on the bridlepath from under the old 
    railway bridge, known as Wilmer Bridge, to the bridge over the river Churn 
    needed to be cut back to allow access to horse riders. The hedge on the 
    south side of the adopted road to Wildmoorway Bridge was also in need of 
    attention. He further asked the Clerk to remind the Rangers that the repair 
    to a staggered post and rail fence which had been vandalised to the north of 
    Robert Franklin Way play area adjacent to the bridge over the river Churn, 
    still needed attention.<br>
    <b>Tree Planting Scheme</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to implement the tree planting scheme at Upper Up, 
    prepared for the Parish Council by Whitton Associates. It further agreed 
    that the work be scheduled to take place during the winter period 2004/2005. 
    Cllr Squire suggested that a sub-committee take responsibility to create a 
    plan. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Stuart that the Village 
    Maintenance &amp; Playing Field Committee would be a more suitable group. Cllr 
    Jay informed the meeting that the South Cerney Village Trust would like to 
    be actively involved. The Clerk will draft an article for publication in the 
    Cerney News to inform the public that the planting scheme is now active.<br>
    <b>Public Seat</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to accept an offer of a donation from R.O.W. Berry 
    to finance a public seat. Cllr Jay suggested that a litter bin be sited 
    alongside. The Parish Council agreed. Mr Berry had informed the Clerk that 
    he would provide materials and labour to install the seat free of charge. 
    The Parish Council agreed to place the seat on the grassy area outside the 
    Laurels, opposite the Fish &amp; Chip shop in Clarks Hay. The Clerk will seek 
    permission from GCC Highways.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way Play Area Official Opening</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to invite Mrs Shirley Alexander Chairman of the 
    Capital Grants panel at CDC and/or her deputy Phil Coleman, Natasha McKenna, 
    Simon King and Mrs Linda Lloyd to attend a ceremony to officially open the 
    refurbished play area at Robert Franklin Way. The Clerk had liaised with Ms 
    McKenna who suggested that Saturday 13th November could be a suitable date. 
    Ms McKenna proposed the ceremony consist of a ribbon cutting, a plaque 
    presentation, possibly a balloon contest with a small prize to attract young 
    families and a tent with tea urn, maybe even a glass of wine, to provide 
    sustenance to those attending.<br>
    <b>River Bank Erosion in Bow Wow</b><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Jay reported on two areas of river bank erosion in Bow 
    Wow downstream of the Millennium seat and asked the Clerk to report the 
    damage to both the GCC Highways and the Environment Agency and to copy the 
    correspondence to Cllr Parsons (GCC). Cllr Stuart thanked the reporter from 
    the Wilts and Glos Standard for highlighting the state of the carriageway in 
    a recent newspaper article.<br>
    <b>Bow Wow Bridge</b><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to support the plan to create a ramp off the 
    planned replacement bridge in Bow Wow. The Clerk was to request Barry 
    Greenaway, GCC Street Lighting to erect a street lamp by the bridge in Bow 
    Wow. Cllr Mrs Chubb asked the Clerk to enquire from him what had happened to 
    the plan to install extra street lights in Station Road.<br>
    <b>River Churn</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the bank of the river Churn to the west of the 
    bridge in School Lane had been damaged by contractors mowing weeds and 
    should be reinstated. He asked the Clerk to report the situation to Mr 
    Blackler at the Environment Agency. He also recommended that the area be 
    added to the ground maintenance schedule for next year. Some dog walkers 
    were not clearing up their dogs mess along this stretch. The Clerk was to 
    ask for a doggy bin to be installed. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    <b>Quotes</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest and left the debate.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chapman that the 
    Parish Council agrees with the recommendations of the Committee that R.O.W. 
    Berry should (a) clear the dead tree to ground level on the western side of 
    Clarks Hay to the north of Meadow Way and (b) fix the swing gate to operate 
    properly at Cerney Wick play area. James Harris should (a) prune the tree 
    next to 1 Broadway Court, Broadway Lane, South Cerney of its overhanging 
    branches and leave the tree with a uniform appearance;<br>
    (b) replace the missing board from the front of the children’s static play 
    engine at Robert Franklin Way play area. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour. Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting.<br>

    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on Monday 11 October.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/X</b><br>
    Applicant: Westbury Homes<br>
    Variation of condition 20 of permission CT.0006/2/X to allow erection of 
    stone piers and timber boundary fence at southern boundary at The Limes, 
    South Cerney (R)<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    A stone pier and timber panel fence would not be a sufficient substitute for 
    a proper stone wall, for precisely the same reasons stated in our reply to 
    application CT.0006/3/Y.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/Y</b><br>
    Applicant: Westbury Homes<br>
    Removal of condition 20 of permission CT.0006/2/X requiring the erection of 
    a natural stone wall on the southern boundary at The Limes, South Cerney (R)<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    The stone wall was an important integral part of the design of The Lime 
    development, and is still required to enhance visual amenity. Moreover, the 
    existing temporary wooden fence is not strong enough as a safety barrier, 
    bearing in mind the heavy industrial vehicles that use the adjoining site. 
    Also, a wall will afford a much more effective noise barrier, shielding the 
    houses better than a fence.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/3/Z</b><br>
    Applicant: Watermark Ltd<br>
    Erection of service area and gardeners shed at Lake 16, Spine Road, South 
    Cerney (R)<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0006/4/A</b><br>

    The Committee recommends that the previous objections are repeated and to 
    include that it is of the opinion that the cycle store is inadequate. Before 
    any final decision can be taken by the Parish Council answers to the 
    following questions are requested: 1. What is the type and source of the 
    natural stone to be used? 2. What is the type and colour of the 
    reconstituted or natural roof tiles?<br>
    3. What is the type, colour and finish of the cladding material to be used? 
    If permission is granted the Parish Council recommends that all power lines 
    will be underground. Further, any external lights should be of a design to 
    achieve optimal reduction of light pollution; all signage to be kept to a 
    minimum and subject to separate detailed planning approval; Section 106 
    contributions to include an all weather enclosed play area in South Cerney, 
    a substantial contribution to play areas in both Cerney Wick and South 
    Cerney, a contribution to upgrade the SUSTRANS Route 45 and a contribution

    Hotel Development (re-submission) on land at the junction of the A419 and 
    B4696, Cotswold Water Park, by North Wiltshire District Council<br>
    The Committee is of the opinion that this application, if granted would be 
    over development in this location at the entrance to the Water Park. The 
    treatment and discharge of sewage will create strains on the existing 
    infrastructure. The Committee was very concerned that a poor design would 
    lower the tone and character of this very attractive location. The 
    development will destroy the habitat of local wildlife, flora and fauna. It 
    is considered that there is sufficient Travel Lodge type accommodation 
    adjacent to the trunk road linking the M4 and M5 in the local vicinity. 
    Adequate consideration should be given to traffic impact before any 
    permission is granted.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the 
    Parish Council accepts the deliberations of the Planning Committee on the 
    foregoing applications with the exception of CT.0006/3/X, CT.0006/3/Y, 
    CT.0006/3/Z, CT.0006/4/A and CT.4067/2/R for which the Planning Committee 
    had asked for ratification as they had been determined prior to the meeting. 
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <b>Planning Applications granted by the Cotswold District Council</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0144/4/V</b><br>
    Erection of single storey garden room extension on land adjacent to Hailwood, 
    Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    Condition of note is: 1. Notwithstanding the submitted drawings, a 
    close-boarded fence of 2 (two) metres in height shall be permanently 
    maintained along the western boundary of the application site where it runs 
    parallel to the west elevation of the extension hereby permitted. Reason: To 
    preserve the privacy of the neighbouring property, in accordance with the 
    guidance within PPG1 and Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1 and 44.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0776/R</b><br>
    Erection of new dwelling (revised scheme) on land adjacent to Walnut Tree 
    Farmhouse, Upper Up, South Cerney<br>
    Conditions of note are: 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and 
    Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, or any other 
    statutory instrument amending or replacing it, no extensions, structures, 
    new openings, hardstandings or means of enclosure shall be erected, 
    constructed or inserted within the application site other than those 
    permitted by this Decision Notice. Reason: The site or building has a 
    distinct and attractive character and appearance which should be maintained. 
    In order to protect these qualities, it is essential for the Local Planning 
    Authority to maintain control over the types of development listed above, in 
    accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 27, 29 and 40, and 
    PPG15. 4. The development shall not be occupied or brought into use until 
    the vehicle parking and manoeuvring facilities have been completed in all 
    respects in accordance with the approved details and they shall be similarly 
    maintained thereafter for that purpose. Reason: In the interests of highway 
    safety, and in order to ensure that the development complies with Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policy 47. 5. The development shall not be brought into 
    use or occupied until the existing Cotswold drystone walls have been 
    repaired and made sound in accordance with details approved in writing by 
    the Local Planning Authority. Reason: Cotswold drystone walls are a 
    characteristic, traditional feature of the Cotswolds. The walls identified 
    on the drawing contribute to the character of the area in accordance with 
    Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 42 and must be retained as part of the 
    development and repaired and made sound for the future. The Conservation 
    Team of the Department of Development and Heritage, Trinity Road, 
    Cirencester will provide advice on the repair of the walls if required. 9. 
    The external walls of the proposed building shall be built of Cotswold 
    rubble walling stone. Reason: To ensure that in accordance with Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policies 1, 27, 29 and 40, and PPG15, the development 
    will be constructed of materials that are appropriate to the locality and/or 
    the existing building. It is important to protect and maintain the character 
    and appearance of the area in which this development is located. The 
    Conservation Team will be happy to advise on the details of the materials. 
    10. The roof of the proposed building shall be covered with natural or 
    artificial Cotswold stone slates. Reason: To ensure that, in accordance with 
    Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 27, 29 and 40, and PPG15 and PPG1, 
    the development will be constructed of materials that are appropriate to the 
    locality and the existing building. It is important to protect and maintain 
    the character and appearance of the area in which this development is 
    located. The Conservation Team will be happy to advise on the details of 
    materials. 14. All windows and doors shall be painted timber in a colour to 
    be first approved in writing the Local Planning Authority and shall 
    thereafter be maintained in the approved colour unless an alternative is 
    first approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Reason: to ensure 
    that, in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 27, 29 and 
    40, and PPG15, the development will safeguard the character of this building 
    which affects the setting of a listed building within a Conservation Area. 
    Traditionally, doors and windows in the locality are painted, while stained 
    timber, in a brown or chestnut colour rarely looks appropriate in buildings 
    constructed of real or artificial Cotswold stone.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1470/1/A</b><br>
    New building to provide restaurant, gym and swimming pool at Spring Lakes, 
    Station Road, South Cerney<br>

    built of horizontal timber boarding. Reason: To ensure that in accordance 
    with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 2 and 40 and Water Park Policy 
    8.1, PPG1 and PPG7, the development will be constructed of materials that 
    are appropriate to the locality and/or the existing building. It is 
    important to protect and maintain the character and appearance of the area 
    in which this development is located. The Conservation Team will be happy to 
    advise on the details of the materials. 3. The roofslopes of the development 
    shall be covered with timber cladding. Reason: To ensure that in accordance 
    with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 2 and 40 and Water Park Policy 
    8.1, PPG1 and PPG7, the development will be constructed of materials that 
    are appropriate to the locality and/or the existing building. It is 
    important to protect and maintain the character and appearance of the area 
    in which this development is located. The Conservation Team will be happy to 
    advise on the details of the materials. 4. The development shall not start 
    until samples of the proposed walling and roofing materials have been 
    approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and only the approved 
    materials shall be used. Reason: To ensure that in accordance with Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policies 2 and 40 and Water Park Policy 8.1, PPG1 and 
    PPG7, the development will be constructed of materials of a type, colour, 
    texture and quality that will be appropriate to the site and its 
    surroundings. 5. The development shall not start before the finish for the 
    external woodwork has been approved in writing by the Local Planning 
    Authority. The external woodwork shall be finished and thereafter maintained 
    in the approved colour. Reason: To ensure that in accordance with Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policies 2 and 40 and Water Park Policy 8.1, PPG1 and 
    PPG7, the development will safeguard the character of this building which is 
    prominent in an open countryside location. It is important to protect and 
    maintain the character and appearance of the area in which this development 
    is located. The colour of the finish of the external woodwork will have a 
    significant effect on the appearance of the proposed development.<br>

    Cllr Harris opposed the statement that it is not expected that gravel 
    extraction will have any impact on fauna. He said hedgerows and especially 
    hedgerow trees are liable to experience ‘drought’ conditions during 
    dewatering of a quarry. Two important specimens should be noted in the 
    hedgerow running from NW to SE dividing this area from an area already 
    excavated, notably one black poplar nationally uncommon and one pollarded 
    beech which is the only example in the whole of the Water Park. These must 
    be preserved and suitable conservation measures must be suggested and 
    executed. The Clerk was to ask the CDC to impose TPO orders on the specimens 
    for their protection. The footpath which crosses the area is not mentioned

    Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) reported that the saga of the adoption of Kingfisher 
    Place continues. Cllr S. Parsons said that he fully supports the Parish 
    Council in its quest to reduce the speed limits on Cirencester Road.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard made an apology for her absence at the next round of 
    meetings as she would be on holiday.<br>
    Cllr Webb enquired about the cost of installing interactive speed notifiers. 
    Cllr Squire informed him that dependent on the installation it could cost 
    from £2-3k if power came from the post on which erected but if an 
    underground supply was needed the cost could be from £3-5k. Cllr Webb 
    reported that some speed notifiers in Swindon operated on solar energy. Cllr 
    Squire would research the cost of interactive signs. Cllr Webb made an 
    apology for his absence at the next round of meetings.<br>
    Cllr Jay was very impressed with the refurbishment of the Corinium Museum in 
    Cirencester and encouraged members to make a visit as he considered it well 
    worth the entrance fee. Cllr Jay had taken colour photographs of the 
    multiplication of advertising signs in Station Road and at its junction with 
    Spine Road. The Clerk had passed one set to Ms Gillian Portlock, Traffic 
    Manager at GCC Highways. He enquired if there was any plan to clear the 
    ditch in Station Road. Cllr Harris will inspect and report.<br>
    Cllr Smith complained that vehicles were driving on the Piece. It was agreed 
    that if a low single rail fence was erected at both ends it would denote the 
    area of public amenity land. Cllr Harris would try and take advantage of a 
    free offer of 60 trees and shrubs and if he was successful in obtaining them 
    a work party could be organised to plant a hedge to further protect the 
    Piece.<br>
    Cllr Caunce was concerned by the number of advertising signs at the end of 
    Station Road and its junction with Cerney Wick Lane. He asked the Clerk to 
    ascertain what the policy of CDC or GCC Highways was for cleaning of the 
    carriageway and the traffic bollards.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the edges of Wickwater Lane were giving away 
    and asked the Clerk to report the problem to GCC Highways.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to report the dirty condition of the Cerney 
    Wick Lane carriageway.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to enquire when the CDC expected to complete 
    the public art project in Jubilee Gardens.<br>
    Cllr Stuart observed that the only item on the Village Appraisal “wish list” 
    which had not been achieved was the cycle track from South Cerney to 
    Siddington. Cllr Parsons (GCC) would enquire into its feasibility.<br>
    Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire had met with Phil Cluley and a senior colleague 
    both from GCC PROW, plus representatives of the Gloucestershire Local Access 
    Forum, to inspect recent work on footpaths which had been completed in 
    recent months.<br>
    Cllr Stuart informed the Parish Council that the Village Hall had been 
    booked on Saturday 6 November for a consultation exercise with residents to 
    try and tease out suitable projects to include in the Village Plan. He 
    expected the exercise to last from 10am until 5pm.<br>
    Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to inform Stagecoach of the pick up arrangements 
    at Kingfisher Place where the bus stop on the northern side of the 
    carriageway acts a pick up point for passengers on both sides of the street. 
    An incident had been reported by a resident of a bus driver refusing to 
    stop.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the meeting at 10.30pm.</td>
