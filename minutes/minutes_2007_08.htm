 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the Youth Parish Council was present.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart apologised for inadvertently misleading the 
 Parish Council at last month’s meeting with his estimation of the cost of 
 tarmacadam safety surface for the MUGA. He was in the progress of sourcing 
 other quotations and applying for further grants. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris informed the Clerk that the replacement curfew 
 restriction sign had not yet been received. The flags on the bus stops in 
 Station Road and Broadway Lane had eventually been replaced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that the vehicle activated speed 
 sign in Station Road was behaving erratically although the one in Silver Street 
 had been repaired.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After a telephone conversation with Dr Andrea Pellegram 
 (CDC) it was agreed that a list of planning permissions, which in the view of 
 the Parish Council had Conditions which were being ignored, would be drawn up. 
 On Friday 27th July I accompanied Cllr Webb to the Village Hall to compile such 
 a list. After analysis, Dr Pellegram suggested that representatives of the 
 Parish Council come to CDC offices to discuss the alleged breaches of the 
 Conditions at 11.30am on Tuesday 4th September. Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 would attend the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 31st July I attended a meeting with Stephen 
 Woodd (Kompan), Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb on the Upper Up play area to discuss 
 his company’s quotation for a MUGA enclosure. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During July, of the 22 available working days, I averaged 
 4&#61561; hours per day which is about 25% more than my contract stipulates, but which 
 I accept.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>STATION ROAD DITCH</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman invited Mr &amp; Mrs Gardner to make a statement 
 to the assembled Parish Councillors. Mr Gardner complained about the herbage in 
 the open ditch outside his property in Station Road which in his opinion should 
 be cut down. He also complained that the detritus left after the fracturing of 
 the sewerage main had not been dredged. The Clerk explained that Thames Water 
 Ltd insisted that contractors had cleaned the ditch but the Parish Council was 
 not convinced. The Clerk would ask CDC if an analysis of the sludge could be 
 carried out to determine if action was needed to remove it. Cllr Harris 
 informed Mr Gardner that the wild growth on the banks of the ditch would be 
 removed in the autumn and had been left purposely as a wildlife habitat. It 
 would also be difficult to recruit a suitable contractor to dredge the ditch as 
 new regulations required an operator to have a licence to remove contaminated 
 waste and also the added expense of its disposal to a special site. Cllr Jay 
 agreed with Mr Gardner in that he would like to see the herbage removed. Cllr 
 Harris and Cllr Jay agreed to carry out a survey of the growth and report their 
 conclusions to the Parish Council in September. The Clerk was requested to ask 
 Purvey Groundworks to quote for the dredging and removal of the spoil from the 
 ditch. Mr &amp; Mrs Gardner then left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE 
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th AUGUST
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended that meeting. Cllr Walker had 
 joined the meeting at 8pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Cllr Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">MATTERS ARISING</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;“Curfew” Restrictions</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he had been informed by residents in the vicinity of 
 the Robert Franklin Way play area that excessive noise was causing disturbance 
 despite the erection of the restricted use notice. He had suggested that 
 concerned residents should use their Neighbourhood Watch scheme and contact 
 their facilitator at Cirencester Police station. Diaries of disorder should be 
 kept to form an evidential case for official action. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damaged Manhole Cover</b> <br>
 Enquiries made by Cllr Caunce ascertained that the broken manhole cover outside 
 the Londis in Broadway Lane was the responsibility of the property owner. The 
 Clerk was asked to write to the owner and request that the broken cover is 
 replaced or repaired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fenplay Safety Surface</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart stated that since the meeting on Monday evening George Taylor had 
 provided a quotation for the repair of the safety surface and the supply and 
 distribution of sand. Cllr Stuart had reminded Mr Taylor that the Parish 
 Council would make its own arrangements for distributing the sand and could he 
 requote. Cllr Stuart had, however, spoken to Ian, a director of Glebe 
 Contractors who admitted damaging the safety surface with his equipment. The 
 Clerk was asked to write to Glebe Contractors thanking it for his candour 
 informing him that reimbursement for the cost of the repair will be expected. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Seating Audit</b> <br>
 A convenient time had not yet been arranged for members of the audit team to 
 carry out its assessment. Cllr Harris asked that a map of the village be 
 provided to make it easier to record the locations of the seats. The Clerk had 
 provided such a map. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Notice Boards</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to ascertain from R.O.W. Berry if his quotation to rebuild 
 the notice board at the bus stop, near the Limes, included recovering it with 
 self sealing pin board. If so, the Committee recommend that the Finance 
 Committee accepts the quotation and approves the issuing of an order for the 
 work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Signs</b> <br>
 Dave Flagg had emailed a quotation and style of sign for confirmation which was 
 significantly different from the £60 price originally quoted. The new quote was 
 for £95.24. The Committee agreed that the style of the sign was appropriate. 
 Another sign had been removed in Cerney Wick which would be added to the order. 
 The Clerk had reported both incidents as theft to Cirencester Police for 
 investigation. The investigation number was 424:31:07:07 and the crime 
 complaint number 29488/07.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to enquire from Mr Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire 
 Highways, how the survey was progressing as the recent high water flow has 
 exacerbated the situation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow Tree Trunks <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris reported that some one, person or persons unknown, had removed 
 the tree trunks which were allegedly causing an obstruction to vehicles using 
 the carriageway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>360 degree Swing at Robert Franklin Way play area</b>
 <br>
 Members of the Payback in the Community team had excavated the supports of the 
 swing which exposed the problem identified by Cllr Harris. Repairs were carried 
 out and the Committee was grateful for the diligence of Cllr Harris in his 
 persistence that a problem did exist. The Clerk was asked to write to the team 
 leader in Gloucester to express the gratitude of the Parish Council for the 
 work carried out by the Payback in the Community team especially during the 
 inclement weather conditions on Friday 13th July. Sam Josephs was also to be 
 congratulated for his efforts which were very much appreciated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Quotations for Ground Maintenance at Jubilee Gardens 
 and the connecting pathway to High Street</b> <br>
 A quotation from Glebe Contractors was analysed by the Committee which agreed 
 that the spraying schedule be carried out on two occasions each year and the 
 grass cut on three occasions. The Clerk was asked to recommend this decision to 
 the Finance Committee for its approval.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the rubbish bin on the playing field needed to be 
 emptied.. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that one of the goal posts area had yet to be replanted. 
 The grass cut had not been done inside the “No Dogs Area” and the Clerk was 
 asked to inform the contractors. Overhanging branches on the bridlepath had 
 been cleared.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the Fireman’s Pole on the activity area had been 
 broken off. The metal post had been removed and was currently stored nearby for 
 safety. Its repair has been organised. The play surface is in urgent need of 
 repair and Cllr Stuart will make further attempts to contact George Taylor (Fenplay 
 Ltd) to carry them out. The cycle mounds had been cut and were proving a great 
 asset for youngsters to enjoy. The Football Club continue to leave black 
 plastic bags of rubbish in the car park for collection although requested to 
 refrain from this practice. A suggestion by Cllr Harris that the dog bin be 
 moved from the car park entrance to between the pedestrian entrance and the 
 vehicle gate on the right hand side of the car park was agreed. Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 volunteered to stand in for Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart when they were away on 
 their holidays during part of July and August.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REVIEW OF RECENT FLOODS</b> <br>
 Overall, the Committee agreed that the Parish had escaped very lightly in 
 comparison with other parts of the county during the floods of the 20th July. 
 Of particular note: 1. the triangular inspection chamber outside the chip shop 
 in Clarks Hay flooded the area with sewage; 2. access to the sluice gate at 
 Fanshawe Weir was restricted as it was not possible to contact the key holder. 
 The Clerk was asked to write to Lady Fanshawe, owner of the riparian rights, to 
 see what action could be taken in the event of a future flood; 3. the Parish 
 Council's thanks should be expressed to the Environment Agency for its work on 
 the river bank up stream from the village which had undoubtedly contributed to 
 stopping a repetition of the floods of 2000. The Clerk was asked to arrange a 
 meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss how further concerns with the 
 state of the bridges, culverts and water way can be addressed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Bennett (CDC) reported that Gloucestershire Highways 
 were well aware of the problem in Clarks Hay which had once again flooded in 
 the vicinity of the Laurels and the entrance to Meadow Way and are 
 investigating. Cllr Stuart had been informed that the culvert at the entrance 
 to Meadow Way which connected to the open ditch had been partially blocked with 
 a drop kerb.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker repeated his complaint that fly tipping items 
 had not been removed from land adjacent to Ann Edwards School. He was advised 
 to report the incident to Roger Sollis at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that during wet weather sewerage 
 contractors’ vehicles leaving their site near Kingfisher Place were leaving mud 
 on the carriageway. The Clerk will advise the Parish Council’s agent Chris 
 Graham at Moore Allen &amp; Innocent about the incident. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reminded members that it had been agreed 
 earlier in the year that he should accompany Mr Timbrell on a hedge cutting 
 exercise at Upper Up. It was pointed out by Cllr Stuart that due to the 
 erection of sewerage contractors’ fences, access to much of the hedge would be 
 impossible. It was agreed to delay any work until the sewerage work was 
 completed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had been approached by Mr Squire who had 
 enquired what action, if any, had been taken on progressing the application to 
 make Ham Lane a public right of way. Cllr Nicholas would liaise with Steve 
 Coffey who had agreed to manage the application. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb stated that she had reported an incident of 
 fly tipping in Wick Water Lane to Roger Sollis at CDC. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge complained that holes in the surface of 
 the highway in the vicinity of Edwards College had not been denoted and 
 therefore would probably be ignored by the repair team. The Clerk will inform 
 Gillian Portlock at Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce closed the 
 meeting at 8.47pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th 
 AUGUST</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb had attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.50pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay enquired as to the outcome of the quotations received to trim the tree 
 limbs overhanging the bridle path at Robert Franklin Way play area. The Clerk 
 reported that the contract had been awarded to James Harris Contracting who had 
 supplied the cheapest quotation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE 
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE</b> <br>
 The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee had recommended that the 
 Finance Committee ratify its decision to refurbish the notice board at the bus 
 stop, near The Limes, if the quotation received from R.O.W. Berry included the 
 mounting of a cover of self sealing pin board. The Finance Committee concurred 
 and will propose that the Parish Council accepts its decision. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that if the Clerk ascertained that the quote included the pin board cover 
 the Parish Council agrees to refurbish the notice board. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee also 
 recommended that the Finance Committee ratify its decision to accept the 
 quotation from Glebe Contractors to carry out ground maintenance at the Pocket 
 Park and the path way leading to the High Street. It was calculated that this 
 extra work would cost £395. The Finance Committee agreed with the 
 recommendation and will propose that the Parish Council accepts its decision. 
 It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Tunbridge that the Parish 
 Council accepts the quotation from Glebe Contractors. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour.</p>

 subtleties of the risk allocation. He would liaise with the Clerk and a further 
 draft would be discussed by the Parish Council at its next meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROVISION OF SAND BAGS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land had circulated her research and proposals 
 prior to the debate. Cllr Mrs Land had contacted suppliers for quotations to 
 supply either sand or bags or filled sand bags. Cllr Nicholas stated that it 
 was the responsibility of individual home owners to provide for the emergency 
 flood protection of their properties. Cllr Jay said he would object to any 
 proposal that the Parish Council supplies sand bags although he found the idea 
 admirable it was, in his view, impractical because of the numbers of bags that 
 would be required. There were no facilities to fill, store, distribute or 
 install sand bags on such a scale. It was the responsibility of residents to 
 provide their own prevention plan. Cllr Bennett (CDC) endorsed the comments of 
 Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Jay reiterating that there was no direct labour force 
 available to implement the distribution. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chapman that this Parish Council makes provision for the storage, distribution 
 and installation of sand bags for use in emergency situations. After a vote two 
 parish councillors were in favour and 9 were against. The motion was therefore 
 defeated. Cllr Jay asked that Flood Prevention be added as an item to the 
 agenda for discussion at the September meeting. This was agreed.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had contacted the management at Waters Edge, 
 Lake 10 and asked that the herbage on the public footpath from their site to 
 the old railway line be cut. Sean Hodgson agreed to the request.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb noted that in periods of excessive rainfall the 
 surface water enters the sewerage system in Broadway Lane. The system is 
 incapable of handling the excess and consequently it overflows sewage into 
 residents’ gardens. It is particularly noticeable in properties numbered 16 and 
 24. </p>

 Meeting of the Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee on 27th July at CDC. </p>

 next month’s meetings. Cllr Mrs Land asked the Clerk to inform Gloucestershire 
 Highways that the hedge to the right of the Hoburne at the junction of Broadway

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb also asked the Clerk to inform 
 Gloucestershire Highways that the hedge at the cross roads near Berry Farm also
