 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 13th MAY 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Members of the Parish Council 
 were all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Michael Brown, Sinead Peare and Jasmine Tresadern of the 
 Youth Parish Council attended the meeting. Sinead requested that a reminder to 
 attend these meetings be sent to her. The Clerk pointed out that his last 
 instruction was to inform Joe Lodge and to this end had emailed him an agenda 
 and draft minutes six days prior to every meeting. He would now let Sinead know 
 instead. Sinead reported that recent business of the YPC included a debate on 
 what sort of equipment should be installed on the old basketball court at Upper 
 Up. The YPC had shortlisted three items of which a wheel chair roundabout was 
 preferred. Cllr Jay suggested that a piece of equipment which could be used by 
 disabled youth would attract publicity for the YPC and possibly be easier to 
 acquire grant aid from funders. Cllr Mrs Land suggested that a “birds nest” 
 swing should be considered as it would suit children and adults with 
 disabilities. Cllr Mrs Land volunteered to help with the specification and Cllr 
 Jay will help with any grant application. Sinead reported that more publicity 
 material was needed. Cllr Jay offered to print the black and white items free 
 of charge and the YPC should email the Clerk with details of the colour work 
 and quantities required so that he could obtain a competitive quote. Cllr 
 Stuart thanked the members of the YPC for coming to the meeting. There being no 
 further business the group then left the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that three further incidents had 
 occurred at the Cricket Club’s pavilion since the fire in April. The Police had 
 been informed and Sgt McIntyre told Cllr Stuart that he had briefed the PCSOs 
 to keep a watch on the area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that on Wednesday 20th May he had 
 attended the Annual Parish Meeting of the Parish Council in the Village Hall. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 21st May he accompanied Cllr Mrs Tunbridge to 
 the RIAT briefing at Bader House, RAF Fairford. The Air Show will take place on 
 the Saturday 18th and Sunday 19th July. The theme this year will be the 60th 
 anniversary of NATO. This year more than 300 aircraft will partake in the gala 
 including Vulcan XH558, the legendary V-bomber. The various traffic routes were 
 comprehensively explained with the closest to South Cerney being the “Brown” 
 route which will take traffic from the south and west after leaving M4 junction 
 17 to the B4696 Spine Road and merging with the “Green” route from the M5 to 
 the A417/A419 to the “Green” car park area. After last year’s cancellation it 
 was interesting to learn than although the insurance had cost £100,000, more 
 than £4.3million had been paid back in compensation. Through the astuteness of 
 the organisers the premium would be discounted by a further 12% this year as 
 part of the agreed package. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 5th June he returned a call to Richard Robinson 
 from Moore Stephens Accountants who are carrying out the audit on the Parish 
 Council’s accounts. Mr Robinson had enquired if the Parish Council had sought a 
 competitive tender for the MUGA and what consultation had been carried out. He 
 believed that the auditor was satisfied with the explanations given. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During May of the 19 available working days he had 
 averaged 4 hours 15 minutes per day which is more than 3 hours a week in excess 
 of his contract. May is a particularly busy month for any Parish Clerk. In 
 addition to the usual Parish Council meeting there is the added work associated 
 with the Annual Parish meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas enquired if the Clerk was content with the 
 extra time involved. The Clerk replied that he was happy with the situation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8th JUNE 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had opened the meeting at 7 pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Harris that Cllr Caunce 
 continues as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee. 
 Cllr Caunce accepted the nomination. The Committee voted all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Vice Chairman <br>
 </b>It was proposed by Cllr Tunbridge and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that Cllr 
 Stuart continues as Vice Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance 
 Committee. Cllr Stuart accepted the nomination. The Committee voted all in 
 favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Kimberley had sent an apology for his absence as he was working with a 
 youth group. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Parish Council.</b>&nbsp; It was noted that the 
 YPC was actively researching play equipment to replace the old basketball post 
 and net at Upper Up. The Committee agreed that it was important to take into 
 account how user friendly any new piece would be to less agile children in the 
 community.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bow Wow Trees.</b>&nbsp; Cllr Stuart reported that 
 three Poplars had now been cut down. Cllr Harris reported that the Ash tree had 
 been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shorncote Path.</b> Cllr Stuart stated that there had 
 been nothing further to report on the completion of the outstanding work since 
 last month. Cllr Stuart had met with Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP and discussed 
 the completion of the sewerage system. Mr Clifton-Brown MP intimated that he 
 would be willing to attend an opening ceremony. It was proposed that the MP is 
 requested to persuade Thames Water to settle its outstanding account for 
 professional fees and complete the reinstatement work after which the Parish 
 Council would welcome an opening ceremony. Cllr Stuart had discussed this plan 
 with Chris Graham of Moore Allen and Innocent who was in favour of the 
 approach. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grass Cutting.</b> Cllr Stuart described the latest 
 grass cutting as first class. He asked Cllr Caunce if there had been any 
 complaints about Cerney Wick but there had not, as far as he was aware. Cllr 
 Mrs Chubb asked that the contractor be requested to strim the sides and bottom 
 of the ditch in Station Road sometime after the middle of next month (July). </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Meeting with Mr Neudegg, Chief Executive Officer 
 Cotswold District Council.</b> Cllr Clive Bennett (CDC) offered to arrange a 
 day time meeting with Mr David Neudegg. The suggested timing of such an event 
 would not be ideal as most Parish Councillors are at work. The Clerk was to 
 enquire from Cllr Bennett, if Mr Neudegg could be persuaded to attend an 
 evening event. There are slots available before Parish Council meetings for 
 such discussions, starting at 7pm and lasting no more than 30 minutes in total. 
 A list of probable topics for discussion could be supplied beforehand. Current 
 open dates are the following Wednesdays at 7pm: 8th July; 9th September; 14th 
 October.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recycling Bins at Upper Up.</b> Cllr Stuart complained 
 that personnel in the waste department at CDC were reluctant to meet with him 
 on site to inspect the surface damage caused by the removal and installation of 
 the recycling bins and the extra overt material being left there. The Clerk was 
 asked to contact the portfolio holder Cllr Mark Tufnell to see what assurances 
 can be given in finding a solution to the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Shelter.</b> Cllr Stuart reported that no work 
 had been carried out to the damaged surface of the Youth Shelter. The Clerk 
 stated that he had received a telephone call from an employee of Park Leisure 
 agreeing that the surface was not up to standard and that resurfacing work 
 would be carried out. Meanwhile the recommendation to withhold payment 
 continues. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Aggregate Industries Contact. </b>Cllr Stuart reported 
 that the meeting arranged for 20th May with Aggregate Industries surveyor had 
 been cancelled at the last moment. Another arrangement will be planned soon. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cricket Club Pavilion.</b> Cllr Stuart reported that 
 the reinstatement of the recent fire damage had been virtually completed. Three 
 further damage incidents had occurred to the front door. Cllr Stuart suggested 
 to Peter Wheeler from the Cricket Club that a steel outward opening door plus 
 steel shutters to the windows should be installed. Cllr Stuart will enquire 
 from GPFA if there is any advice on such matters or if there are grants 
 available to provide the necessary protection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up Car Park.</b> Whilst attending the Malvern 
 Spring Show with Cllr Jay, Cllr Stuart saw a system of interlocking plastic 
 squares filled with gravel, which seemed ideal for resurfacing the Upper Up car 
 park. Cllr Stuart invited colleagues to join him at a meeting in the late 
 morning of Monday 15th June when he would discuss the possibilities with a 
 company representative.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ANNUAL INSPECTION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk had emailed a copy of the report to all members 
 of the Committee. Cllr Stuart had not yet seen the one sent to him so the Clerk 
 will email him another. Members of the Committee were asked to read the 
 elements of the report relevant to the playgrounds they inspected. Anything of 
 particular concern could be discussed at the next Committee meeting. Generally 
 the report was not critical about the state of the play areas.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play area was all in order and that he had 
 contacted Tim Bryant whom he expects to carry out the hedge cutting on Tuesday 
 9th June.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. All 
 equipment was in order and a report form was presented at the meeting on 
 Wednesday 10th June.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that all was in order. The old basketball equipment 
 remained, the cycle mounds were being well used with grass, weeds and wild 
 flowers spreading. The grass seed on the scar of the pipeline is growing well 
 in most places. Moles are causing a problem on the cricket ground.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ERECTION OF BUS SHELTER</b> <br>
 The Committee decided to choose a polycarbonate material for the see-through 
 walls and roof of the structure. There was a difference of opinion as to the 
 installation timetable. Garrick Outdoor recommended that the structure is 
 erected on ground which, after installation, could be dug out and covered with 
 concrete. Cllr Caunce thought that it would be better if the base was dug out 
 before erection. Cllr Caunce will discuss which procedure will be adopted with 
 Garrick Outdoor and report back to the Parish Council on Wednesday. Cllr Caunce 
 reported that it had been agreed to dig out the base prior to the installation. 
 Arrangements will now be made with Kevin Messenger to start work.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to contract Tim Bryant to remove the redundant basketball post from the Upper 
 Up playground. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee, including Cllr Jay, recommends that the 
 Clerk enquires from Mr Curtis if he would be prepared to pick up litter in 
 Cerney Wick on a regular basis or when instructed to do so by Cllr Caunce. The 
 Clerk was to offer him £35 per quarter for the service.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the reinstatement of the old 
 railway line from the Spine Road through to Cricklade by the electricity 
 company was of a poor quality and he was very disappointed with the result; 
 Cllr Nicholas added, especially for cyclists. The route is a valuable part of 
 Sustrans 45 and should be in better order. The Committee agreed with Cllr 
 Harris who suggested that the Parish Council should write to the Water Park 
 Society supporting any action it wishes to take against the contractor 
 responsible for the reinstatement of the disused railway line. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris noted that some of the coir rolls in the river 
 Churn in Bow Wow which were washed out had been removed and asked the Clerk to 
 enquire from Gloucestershire Highways when they will be reinstated.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris also noted that the stop-boards at Fanshawe 
 weir had been interfered with and the Clerk was asked to inform Lady Fanshawe 
 and Dave Ludford of the Environment Agency. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform Lady Fanshawe that 
 the evergreen hedge and other branches on the north side of Bow Wow, between 
 Lower Mill and the bridge over the river Churn, needed to be cut back as it was 
 overgrowing the carriageway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to write to the occupants of Broadway 
 Court to inform them that the hedge overgrowing the pavement on Broadway Lane 
 needed to be cut back. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris volunteered to cut back the branches of the 
 Lime trees outside the new development in Station Road.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb and the Clerk will attend a meeting of the 
 Gloucestershire Charter group on 25th June to enquire into the reason for the 
 delay in the assessment being carried out by Gloucestershire Highways on the 
 implementation of the planning condition to provide a cycleway opposite the 
 Four Pillars hotel.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INCREASED PARKING FACILITIES IN BERKELEY CLOSE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Jay joined the discussion. Cllr 
 Caunce had spoken with Gordon Stratford a resident of Berkeley Close who was 
 concerned with the lack of parking in the area. Mr Stratford volunteered to 
 join a group to discuss proposals and to seek interested parties who wished to 
 have the grassed area in Berkeley Close converted into a car park. Cllr Caunce 
 counselled caution as a mandate should be sought from those in the area for 
 such a scheme. Cllr Mrs Land suggested that a meeting could be arranged in the 
 Scout Hut and she would circulate a letter to neighbouring residents inviting 
 them to attend. Cllr Jay queried who would pay? Cllr Caunce agreed that it 
 would be a big challenge but first of all it had to be determined if there was 
 a willingness to go ahead with the plan. Cllr Caunce welcomed Cllr Kimberley 
 who had asked to join the group. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Drop Kerbs</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land reported that no one from Gloucestershire Highways had yet 
 contacted her regarding the plan to install tactile paving and drop kerbs. The 
 Clerk had emailed Chris Franklin and requested him to instruct Paul Swift to 
 liaise with Cllr Mrs Land. There being no further business Cllr Caunce closed 
 the meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON 
 MONDAY 8th JUNE 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land that Cllr Jay 
 continues as Chairman of the Finance Committee. Cllr Jay accepted the 
 nomination. The Committee voted all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Vice Chairman</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that Cllr Webb 
 continues as Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee. Cllr Webb accepted the 
 nomination. The Committee voted all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk reported that the auditor Richard Robinson from 
 Moore Stephens Accountants had enquired if the Parish Council had sought a 
 competitive tender for the MUGA and what consultation had been carried out. The 
 Clerk believed that he was satisfied with the explanations given.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the expenditure detailed on the spread 
 sheet for period 2 was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE PLAYING FIELDS
 AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to contract Tim Bryant to remove 
 the redundant basketball post from the Upper Up playground. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees that the Clerk enquires from Mr 
 Curtis if he would be prepared to pick up litter in Cerney Wick on a regular 
 basis or when instructed to do so by Cllr Caunce. The Clerk was to offer him 
 £35 inclusive of travel per quarter, for the service. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee did not object to any of the above 
 recommendations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr 
 Harris that the Parish Council agrees to the recommendations of the Finance 
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley declared a prejudicial interest in this 
 next item as he was involved in the provision of the bush craft sessions and 
 left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Increase to agreed contribution to the Gloucestershire 
 Youth Service</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mary Mychaleckyj had informed Cllr Jay that increasing 
 numbers of children were showing an interest in attending the bush craft 
 sessions. Originally the budget had estimated that about 11 youths would attend 
 but there now could be up to 18 and if applicants were not to be turned away 
 further funding would be necessary. Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Nicholas 
 seconded a proposal that the Parish Council should be minded to provide up to 
 an extra £200 to support the extra attendance. The Committee was in full 
 approval. The proposition will now seek approval from the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Harris 
 that the Parish Council agrees to the recommendation of the Finance Committee 
 to provide up to an extra £200 to the youth group. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley returned to the room.</p>

 applications because of his professional involvement with the applicant. Cllr 
 Mrs Tunbridge declared a prejudicial interest as a close neighbour and left the 
 room. Cllr Nicholas had also declared a personal prejudicial interest in the 
 following applications as the applicant was a client of his firm and left the 
 room. Cllr Webb took over as Chairman for the following two applications. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECYCLING BINS AT UPPER UP</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had requested that a proposition on the removal 
 of the recycling bins at Upper Up be considered. Cllr Jay opened the discussion 
 stating that he would now like to temporarily withdraw the proposal with the 
 option to reopen it after proper due notice. Cllr Stuart described the 
 recycling facility as well used and of benefit to the community and the waste 
 management operation of the District Council. He continued that there is a 
 growing problem with fly tipping and general untidiness of some users which was 
 not being regularly attended by the waste collection contractors. Further he 
 complained about the lack of cooperation from the waste department at CDC. 
 Another problem was the gouging of the car park surface when the bins were 
 replaced. The skips were tearing up the ground, leaving a scar on the site and 
 a very uneven surface. Caroline Ballinger at CDC had ignored his request for a 
 site meeting to discuss these problems. He appealed to Cllr Bennett (CDC) to 
 use his best efforts to solve the communication problem before the Parish 
 Council debate the removal of the bins from Upper Up. Cllr Bennett had spoken 
 to Scott Williams (CDC) who informed him that site visits by environment 
 wardens occur regularly and although he acknowledged that there was a problem 
 there was no evidence as to who was responsible. Sita, the waste contractors 
 are now visiting the site every day at 6.30am. Cllr Bennett (CDC) will ask 
 members of the waste management team to arrange a site meeting with Cllr 
 Stuart. Cllr Nicholas was also critical describing the response as lip service. 
 He emphasised that there is an on going problem which needs to be addressed by 
 the portfolio holder who should be more proactive. Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated 
 that he would contact Cllr Mark Tufnell, the portfolio holder, immediately 
 after this meeting to report the discontent of the Parish Council. Cllr Mrs 
 Land enquired if Cllr Stuart had removed any of the rubbish. Cllr Stuart 
 replied that there was too much of it for him to move. Cllr Harris suggested 
 that if a concrete base was installed in the bin area it might relieve the 
 gouging problem and placate residents. Cllr Jay was not impressed with Cllr 
 Bennett’s (CDC) responses and asked that the proposal is included in next 
 month’s agenda.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that Cotswold Hoburne had erected 
 three large advertising signs on the north side of the B4696 (Spine Road). The 
 Clerk was asked to inform Mr Bob Lawrence that he would need to make an 
 application to the CDC planners for permission to advertise in this manner. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce also reported that on the south side of the 
 B4696 (Spine Road) there was an unauthorised board advertising the café. The 
 Clerk was to ask the Enforcement Officer to investigate.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had noted that a hessian bag of salt was 
 leeching into the ground at the entrance to the Upper Up car park and killing 
 off plant growth. The Clerk was asked to offer the salt bag to the Ann Edwards 
 school, free of charge. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that flooding had occurred yet 
 again on the corner of The Street, outside The Barn in Cerney Wick. The Clerk 
 explained that Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways had informed him that 
 natural drainage would eventually disperse the water when levels in the river 
 fell. Cllr Mrs Chapman suggested that if the drain was cleaned the water would 
 enter the system. Nevertheless Stephen Wrigley insisted that there was another 
 solution to the flooding if a drain could be connected to the ditch on the 
 north east side of the carriageway. The Clerk will try and arrange a meeting 
 with Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chapman, Stephen Wrigley and Chris Franklin to find 
 an answer to the problem. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that he had made a grant application to 
 the GPFA on behalf of the Football Club.</p>
