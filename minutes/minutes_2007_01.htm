 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2193 – 1st item <b>Correspondence:</b> delete last 
 sentence and replace it with: The motion had been carried at the Monday evening 
 meeting.<br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Minutes, 
 as amended, were a true and accurate record. Cllr Jay abstained from voting as 
 he was not present at the meeting. The remainder of the Parish Council was all 
 in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In view of the absence of any member of the Youth Parish 
 Council, Cllr Nicholas gave a report on its behalf. Thomas Nicholas had 
 composed a letter to Sport Relief 2006 to accompany the £54 donation raised 
 through the Fun Run event. Members of the YPC were keen to partake in training 
 events in March which were being organised by Claire Dowan (CDC). The Parish 
 Council agreed that travel expenses could be claimed by those taking part on 
 production of a valid bus ticket. Cllr Jay informed the meeting that he had 
 supplied the YPC with a further ream of paper.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Speed Limit Signs<br>
 </b>Cllr Nicholas repeated his observation that the speed limit signs leaving 
 Trenchard Gardens to the main carriageway, South Cerney to Preston Toll Bar had 
 still not been updated. The Clerk confirmed that he had informed 
 Gloucestershire Highways by email. Cllr Squire would remind Gillian Portlock, 
 Area Highway Representative at a planned meeting on Monday 15th January. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Hedge in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris informed the meeting that the overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow had been 
 cut back, although further work was needed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Liberal Democrat Leaflet</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC), a member of the Liberal Democrat party, admitted that 
 there was a slight mistake in the wording and although personally she did not 
 compose the article she did take full responsibility for it. Cllr Mrs Clark 
 (CDC) made an unreserved apology for the misleading information published. 
 There was genuine confusion with the applications CT.2648/3/R &amp; CT.2648/3/S 
 which had only recently been resubmitted after the inclusion of an 
 environmental statement. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would re-check with the Planning 
 Department at CDC and notify the Clerk with her observations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Footpath Bridge</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reminded the Parish Council that Mike Barton PROW officer had sent 
 a detailed quotation for the erection of a replacement bridge on the footpath 
 between the Lock House on Cirencester Road and the Greyhound public house in 
 Siddington. Mr Barton intimated that any financial contribution from the Parish 
 Council would be much appreciated. Cllr Stuart explained that as the footpath 
 was part of a village plan project, consideration should be given to the 
 request. The Parish Council agreed that a donation should be considered and 
 asked the Clerk to put the item on the Finance agenda for next month.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 15th December I accompanied Cllr Webb to a 
 Neighbourhood Policing Consultation meeting at Police Headquarters at 
 Waterwells Drive, Quedgeley. Statistical maps based on multiple regression 
 formats graded INAs in Gloucestershire according to the necessity of police 
 resources and their predictive demand. South Cerney was graded as a 3, 1 being 
 high, 12 low, on current resources but predicted to drop to 5. The proposal 
 being considered was that South Cerney would join the neighbourhood of 
 Cirencester based on statistical evidence. The object of the consultation was 
 to gauge the impact of the new grouping from those residing in the area and to 
 specify local situations which might not necessarily come to light from 
 statistics. Our comments highlighted the population fluctuation in the area 
 during weekends and holiday periods especially in the summer months because of 
 the high proportion of second homes; the confusion created through the 
 proximity of Wiltshire, for example the Spine Road which traverses the 
 Gloucestershire/ Wiltshire border and the differing priorities of the separate 
 police forces in enforcing the speed limit thereon; the impact of the 
 travellers’ site in a neighbouring parish on local facilities in South Cerney 
 for example school attendance, pubs and shops; the large industrial site in 
 South Cerney and its influence on traffic issues by transient users. If changes 
 were to be considered we concluded that Cirencester including Siddington should 
 remain an urban centre and South Cerney should be grouped with other rural 
 satellite communities within the current police INA. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After the meeting I asked Inspector Williams if the 
 Gloucestershire Constabulary had a view on BetterDrivingPlease.com. He had no 
 idea what I was talking about so I explained briefly what the purpose of the 
 web site was for. He replied that if a complaint about a driver’s road 
 behaviour was reported he would write to inform that driver such a report had 
 been received, and from whom, and if there was any comment that driver wished 
 to make. In most cases that would be an end to the matter. He did not elaborate 
 about what action would be taken if the argument escalated. He would not act 
 independently against alleged deeds broadcast on the web. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 4th January I attended a meeting of the 
 Finance Committee at The Old Police House, to discuss budget proposals for the 
 next financial year April 2007 to end of March 2008. Thank you Cllr Smith for 
 the welcome and hospitality provided. In attendance were Cllr Jay, Cllr 
 Nicholas, Cllr Smith, Cllr Squire, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb. The Chairman of 
 the Finance Committee, Cllr Smith will brief the Parish Council later on the 
 deliberations of the Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During December of the 19 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 45 minutes per day which was slightly more than my contract 
 allowed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Field and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 8th January. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk would continue his practice of informing 
 interested Parish Councillors of action taken in reporting matters to various 
 agencies. Parish Councillors concerned would liaise with the Clerk on follow-up 
 action, if an agency’s reaction was considered inadequate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fallen Willow Tree</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had reported that the Payback in the Community team cut up the 
 branches of the fallen willow tree. Cllr Harris stated that he would supply 
 suitable netting and staples to encapsulate the logs to form an eco-pile. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that there was an accumulation of debris in the Station 
 Road ditch at the grille on the eastern end near to the Piece and needs to be 
 cleared to prevent flooding. The Clerk had informed Gillian Portlock at 
 Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Surface Water Overflow Pipe</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had reported that a blue pipe installed to take surface water off 
 the highway, near to Kingfisher Place into Lake 16 was not working. It had been 
 installed to supplement another pipe nearby which was hardly coping with the 
 current heavy discharges. The following afternoon when Cllr Squire inspected 
 the area he found the blue pipe to be functioning properly and informed Cllr 
 Harris of his observations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Advertising “A” Boards</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that advertising “A” boards are still being displayed at 
 the Cerney Wick/Station Road/Eastern Spine Road (B4696) junction. More “A” 
 advertising boards have been seen at the next junction Broadway Lane/B4696 and 
 it was considered that if action is not taken to remove them, this behaviour 
 will increase. The Clerk had informed Gillian Portlock at Gloucestershire 
 Highways and the Enforcement Officer at CDC who would investigate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Breach of Planning Conditions</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire reported that he noted a coach-load of day-trippers making use of 
 canteen facilities at the fisherman’s café near to the junction of the Spine 
 Road and Broadway Lane in clear breach of planning conditions which stated that 
 the facility should only be used by those partaking in fishing activities. The 
 Enforcement Officer at CDC informed the Clerk that he would investigate.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Hedge in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 The Village Maintenance Committee asked the Clerk to enquire from 
 Gloucestershire Highways what progress, if any, had been made in determining 
 ownership of the overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow or what steps taken to reduce it. 
 Cllr Harris reported that the hedge had been cut back but further work was 
 needed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>40mph Speed Limit Sign</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire reported that the 40mph speed limit sign on the road from Preston 
 Toll Bar to South Cerney had been knocked over and was lying in the hedge. The 
 Clerk had asked Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) to inform Siddington Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Estate Agents’ Signs</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that estate agents signs had been erected on public land 
 and asked the Clerk to report the instances to Gloucestershire Highways. Cain &amp; 
 Fuller and Perry Bishop had erected signs at the junction of the East Spine 
 Road (B4696), Cerney Wick Lane and Station Road and also on the roundabout near 
 to the “on” access of the A419 dual carriageway and Cirencester Road. The Clerk 
 had reported the incidents to the Gloucestershire Highways help line.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that everything on the playing field was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that it was currently too wet to fill the hole left when 
 the tower slide unit had been removed. More top soil would be needed in the 
 goal post area when conditions allowed. Trees growing out from the Robert 
 Franklin Way side needed to be back. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the play equipment was in good order although 
 generally the area was very wet. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PRECEPT CONSIDERATIONS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed with Cllr Caunce who proposed that 
 the deliberations of the Finance Committee at a recent precept meeting on 
 village maintenance contracts be accepted.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that the post and rail fence at the 
 entrance to the bridleway, opposite Bridge car park was in need of repair. The 
 fence was there to hinder bolting horses from accessing the B4696 and restrict 
 unauthorised persons using the bridleway. The Clerk had informed Mike Barton 
 PROW who replied that he would check it over on his next visit. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce also reported that the public footpath 
 signpost at the edge of Churn Pool in Cerney Wick Lane is lying in the ditch 
 and should be repaired. The Clerk had informed Mike Barton PROW. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the footpath sign near the 
 gravel car park before Ann Edwards school needed to be repaired. The Clerk had 
 emailed Dave Flagg, Signs &amp; Lines Technician Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported that one of the chain supports at the 
 War Memorial had been dislodged. The Clerk had requested R.O.W. Berry to make 
 the necessary repairs.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay agreed to a request from Cllr Smith to make the 
 report as he had not attended the Committee meeting.</p>

 a proposal would be made to exclude members of the public.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cutts Charity </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay and Cllr Squire declared a prejudicial interest 
 in the next item and left the room. Cllr Smith took over and chaired the 
 remainder of the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Committee meeting on Monday evening prior to the 
 councillors leaving the room Cllr Jay had informed the Committee that income 
 from the Cutts Charity, which this year totalled £300, would be divided equally 
 between the Church, Parish Council and the poor. The charity has been able to 
 subsidise four children at Ann Edwards School on their annual residential trip 
 to the Forest of Dean. If the Parish Council refused to accept its portion then 
 the amount given to the poor could be doubled. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
 that the Parish Council refuses to accept its portion of the charity income. 
 The remainder of the Parish Council was all in favour. </p>

 Conditions to note: 2. Notwithstanding Classes C2 and C3 of the Schedule of the 
 Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, the accommodation shall be 
 used to provide holiday accommodation only, which shall not be occupied as 
 permanent, unrestricted accommodation or as a primary place of residence. 
 Reason: The site is not suitable for permanent, unrestricted accommodation or 
 as a primary place of residence because it is situated outside of an 
 established settlement wherein development is strictly controlled. This 
 condition is imposed in the light of PPS7, PPG21 and Policies 19 and 26 of the 
 Cotswold District Local Plan. 11. The holiday units shall not be occupied from

 condition is imposed in the light of advice in PPG21. 13. From the date any 
 holiday unit is first occupied the developer will at all times hereafter: (a) 
 Undertake an annual audit of all its lessees by the thirteenth day of November 
 in every year to ascertain that the units are being occupied for holiday 
 purposes and not a principal place of residence; or (b) Remedy the situation in 
 the event that there are any detected breaches of the occupancy restrictions; 
 and (c) Report all breaches immediately to the District Council. Reason: This 
 is development which is only permitted at this location because it provides 
 holiday accommodation. This needs to be carefully controlled. This condition is 
 imposed in the light of advice in PPG21. 17. No external lighting shall be 
 installed on the site without the prior written permission of the Local 
 Planning Authority. Reason: To control the impact of the lighting upon this 
 rural area and to safeguard the nature conservation interests of the site. This

 <p class="MsoNormal">As some contributors at last year’s annual parish meeting 
 had taken an inordinate time to give their presentations, it was agreed that in 
 future a time limit be imposed. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by 
 Cllr Mrs Pollard that presentation of reports should be restricted to five 
 minutes followed by a question and answer session of no more than 10 minutes. 
 The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire had observed a session in the Methodist Chapel 
 which was teaching elderly residents how to protect themselves in the event of 
 a fall and he was minded that as coordinator of elderly activities in the 
 Village Plan that this would be a worthwhile project to subsidise. The Clerk 
 was asked to include the proposal in next month’s Finance agenda. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) would make enquiries at CDC and 
 Gloucestershire Highways to discover who was responsible for the issuing of 
 sand bags and inform the Clerk accordingly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay complained about the state of the surface of Bow 
 Wow after the recent heavy rain. After consulting with Gillian Portlock, 
 Gloucestershire Highways, Cllr Squire informed him that he was expecting the 
 clean up to take place this week. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb was concerned that the resurfacing of Broadway 
 Lane might be delayed now that the sewerage work had been postponed. Cllr 
 Squire informed him that the holes in the carriageway will be filled in the 
 near future. He had also informed Gillian Portlock that the refurbishment of 
 the footpath should be a priority. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that after recent resurfacing of 
 the lane leading up from the Crown public house to the old A419 the carriageway 
 was now higher than the public house car park and this causes it to flood in 
 periods of heavy rainfall. The Clerk was asked to report the problem to 
 Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman, Cllr Stuart on behalf of the Parish Council 
 thanked Cllr Squire for his efforts in persuading the lighting department of 
 the County Council to install the new street lights in Broadway Lane.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS CONTRIBUTIONS</b> <br>
 It was agreed that further encouragement should be given to residents to put 
 their names forward as candidates in the forthcoming Parish Council elections. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked that more publicity be given to the tree 
 planting scheme at Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Residents should be informed about the unfortunate delay 
 to the sewerage scheme. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BUDGET PROPOSALS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Due to the sensitive nature of the financial information 
 to be discussed it was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that 
 in view of the confidential nature of the business about to be transacted, it 
 is advisable in the public interest that the public be temporarily excluded and 
 they are instructed to withdraw. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Smith then thoroughly explained the elements of the 
 budget proposals to the Parish Council. If the precept proposal was accepted it 
 would represent an annual increase of £6.07 per band “D” household which 
 approximated to 50p extra per month per house. Finally Cllr Smith proposed, 
 seconded by Cllr Webb that the precept be increased to £66,750. The Parish 
 Council was in full agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 9.30pm.</p>
