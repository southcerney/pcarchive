 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No representative from the Youth Parish Council attended
 the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bollards in Berkeley Close</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land enquired if there was any further development on the redesign of 
 the bollards outside Winchcombe Gardens. The Clerk was requested to inform Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) that the matter was still unresolved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Safer Community Conference</b> <br>
 After Cllr Stuart enquired if Parish Councillors had received his report, Cllr 
 Walker requested that due to a malfunction of his computer he had not. The 
 Clerk will email him a replacement. Cllr Stuart then continued his review of 
 the conference which he found enlightening. He emphasised that under the Crime 
 and Disorder Act 1998 Section responsibility for crime reduction and its 
 prevention ceased to be solely that of the Police. Local councils now have a 
 legal requirement to work in conjunction with every other appropriate agency 
 and authority to reduce crime and the causes of crime. He invited all members 
 of the Parish Council to attend the first meeting of the group led by KIN (“Key 
 Individual Network”) which is comprised of Charles Kingsbury, Ian Kennedy and 
 Cllr Michael Stuart arranged for 28th February at a time to be notified. 
 Working with the KIN the PCSOs will form Neighbourhood Co-ordination Groups (NCGs) 
 that will meet every three months or more often if required. Those groups will 
 be formed by representatives of the communities and their job will be to 
 identify actual problems that concern them. They will present the Safer 
 Community Team with a list of their three main concerns. That list may include 
 actual criminal activities but in other areas where such groups have already 
 been formed, problems such as inconsiderate parking or poor street lighting 
 have been a top priority. Whatever is put forward must to be dealt with by the 
 Safer Community Teams and Cllr Stuart believes they have to report back to the 
 NCG on their progress within three months. Even if nothing has been done they 
 must give reasons. The NCG will be a long term commitment and it is intended 
 that they will review the problems in the community at every meeting and 
 prepare an updated requirement list for action whenever necessary. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Loss of View from Millennium Seat, Bow Wow</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas in reply to a query from Cllr Harris, about his negotiations on 
 reducing the height of the hedge and leylandii obscuring the view from the 
 Millennium Seat towards All Hallows Church, considered he was reasonably 
 confident of a satisfactory outcome.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 11th January I attended a meeting of the SLCC at 
 the Bingham Gallery in Cirencester. The guest speaker was Ms Sam Shippen, 
 current Chair of the National Executive Council of the society who gave a 
 briefing on the implications of the Well Being Power which is Part 1 of the 
 Local Government Act 2000 and provides local authorities with a discretionary 
 power to undertake any action to promote or improve the social, economic and 
 environmental well being of their area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 15th January along with Cllr Stuart I attended a 
 meeting of the Youth Parish Council in the Village Hall. Eight members of the 
 YPC were present plus Claire Dowan (CDC). Cllr Stuart briefed the group on the 
 reasons for the delay with the installation of the MUGA. He explained the hope 
 of enlarging the Scout Hut in Berkeley Close but emphasised that the CDC had 
 yet to be convinced. The Ward Member, Cllr Bennett would explain the 
 opportunity to his colleagues and it was hoped he could persuade them to agree 
 to the plan. I informed the YPC of the Parish Council’s decision to award a 
 grant to the Youth Workers of £2,000 if they could guarantee match funding. 
 After about 40 minutes Cllr Stuart and myself were invited to leave so that the 
 group could continue its meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 11th February I accompanied Cllr Stuart to a meeting at 
 CDC to discuss the compliance of the demands of the Big Lottery Fund and a 
 draft of the legal agreement. Monitoring and inspection schedules will be 
 explained at a further meeting scheduled for 3rd March. During January of the 
 22 available working days I averaged 3 hours 50 minutes per day which is 
 acceptably more than my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>EMERGENCY DRAINAGE AND REINSTATEMENT WORK</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Minutes of Emergency Meeting</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded Cllr Walker that the Minutes of the 
 Emergency Meeting were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was in 
 favour although Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Mrs Land 
 and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge all abstained as they had not attended. Cllr Stuart 
 signed the Minutes. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ratification of decision to award the contract for the 
 pipe installation</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Walker that the Parish Council 
 agrees to ratify the decision to award the contract for the installation of the 
 pipework to James Harris Contracting. Cllr Harris abstained and the remainder 
 of the Parish Council was in agreement.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ratification of decision to award the contract for the 
 reinstatement of the path to the specification of GCC PROW</b> <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Walker and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
 Council agrees to ratify the decision to award the contract for the 
 reinstatement of the bridlepath to James Harris Contracting. Cllr Harris 
 abstained and the remainder of the Parish Council was in agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman, Cllr Stuart was extremely proud of the 
 reaction of the Parish Council to the emergency and particularly wished to 
 thank Cllr James Harris for his expertise in carrying out the work and also 
 Cllr Steve Walker for his invaluable contribution to the operation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 11th 
 FEBRUARY</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb had attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas had opened the meeting at 9.00pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas considered the response from Mike Napper 
 Major Developments Officer at CDC to questions from the Parish Council 
 regarding approved planning applications for Winchcombe Gardens and 22 Broadway 
 Lane as inadequate and incomplete. The Clerk provided previous correspondence 
 relating to the enquiries so that clarification of the situation might be 
 resolved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb stated that the outstanding planning condition 
 of the Four Pillars hotel application relating to the cycle path was still not 
 settled. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications Received</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In deference to the delegation from Cerney Wick the 
 following application for consideration was promoted in the agenda order. Cllr 
 Caunce and Cllr Mrs Chapman declared a prejudicial interest as close neighbours 
 of the site and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.0893/B</b> <br>
 Applicant: Ian Fairbrother, Forge Cottage, Cerney Wick <br>
 Erection of village hall at Cerney Wick Playing Field, Cerney Wick (R) <br>
 After reading the Design &amp; Access Statement Cllr Nicholas noted the lack of 
 quality of materials to be used adding that the proposed structure would not 
 enhance the visual amenity of the area. Cllr Jay argued that as it would be a 
 community asset it cannot be compared with residential buildings and the Parish 
 Council should support the initiative which was laudable. It was agreed between 
 the Cerney Wick delegation and the Parish Council that the application would be 
 withdrawn. The Cerney Wick Village Hall Committee would then seek 
 pre-application advice from a planning officer at CDC and the GRCC before 
 submitting a revised plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce and Cllr Mrs Chapman returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 three applications as the applicant was a business colleague and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.0006/4/Q</b> <br>
 Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Amended plan for alterations to lodge design for plot 46 including provision of 
 a boat house at Plot 46, Lake 16 (Summer Lake), Cotswold Water Park, Broadway 
 Lane, South Cerney (R) <br>
 The addition of a boathouse would compromise the uniformity of design in this 
 development. A clear pattern of design is vital to the character and overall 
 appearance of such second-home developments.<br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.0006/4/W (electronic submission)</b> <br>
 Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Alterations to lodge design for Plot 44 on previously approved holiday lodge 
 development at Lake 16, Station Road, South Cerney <br>
 OBJECTION as it was not possible to interpret the plans on-line. Cllr Nicholas 
 had informed CDC but no action was forthcoming. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/4/B</b> <br>
 Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Amendment to previously approved scheme of holiday lodges Plots 25-50 only (R) 
 Electronic Submission: South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council objects to 
 this application because, although this application is stated only to relate to 
 plots 25-50, the ‘overall layout’ drawing shows a new vehicular entrance on to 
 Cerney Wick Lane. The proposed re-positioning of plots 25-50 will inevitably 
 result in the development spreading right round to the southern edge of Lake 
 11, with lodges positioned in the southern corner. That could add support to an 
 application for a new entrance on to Cerney Wick Lane. Further, this 
 application introduces a new entrance with gate house and barriers on to Cerney 
 Wick Lane which could be the main entrance to the lodges. This will increase 
 the traffic problems at the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Spine Road (B4696) 
 and Station Road. There will, as a matter of course, be more traffic accessing 
 the Spine Road from the leisure complex through that junction. <br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the Parish Council ratify the decisions of the Planning Committee for the 
 preceeding three applications. The Parish Council was in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest as the 
 applicant was his neighbour. Cllr Webb who had made the response on behalf of 
 the Committee to CDC took over the report for this application.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2592/B</b> <br>

 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 11th FEBRUARY
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart, Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker attended the meeting. Cllr 
 Caunce had opened the meeting at 7.04pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CCTV Inspection</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had with Gillian Portlock and Dave Flagg, 
 Gloucestershire Highways, at 9am on Wednesday. The CCTV inspection on the drain 
 would start on 18th February from Albertine in Upper Up to the Old Post Office 
 in High Street. Old roots would be reamed away and Ms Portlock would request 
 the team to do some exploratory work at the garages at Upper Up. Responsibility 
 for removing the obstructions and the silt in the ditch in Station Road had 
 been defaulted to Thames Water. An attempt to survey the drains in Silver 
 Street, in the vicinity of Berry Farm would be made next week. The 
 reinstatement of the river bank in Bow Wow had been approved. Cllr Stuart also 
 reported the continuing appearance of signs outside the fence of Spring Lake at 
 the end of Station Road. Ms Portlock would investigate. Finally, Cllr Stuart 
 reported that the carriageway had subsided outside Chapter Manor</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VAS</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that all VAS signs were now operating correctly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reported that he was having ongoing discussions with Mr Westell 
 of Aggregate Industries on the installation of a suitable barrier. An opinion 
 from PROW officers on the suitability of a restrictive barrier, was awaited. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bore Hole Lease</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that he was in negotiations with the Environment Agency 
 regarding an increase of rent based on the conditions of the original lease.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that one of the top fixing bolts on the Senior Swing was 
 loose. Cllr Walker volunteered to tighten the bolt. Cllr Stuart noted that new 
 bolts would be needed to hold the tops of the chains, as those in place were 
 showing signs of wear. Murphy contractors are in the process of reinstating the 
 cycle mounds. Cllr Harris agreed to give an opinion on the work in progress. 
 The surface of the car park is deteriorating and as those local contractors 
 contacted to improve the surface have been reluctant to provide quotations for 
 the work, Cllr Stuart has been in contact with two firms which provide bespoke 
 surfaces. It may be possible, in conjunction with the Football Club 
 development, to enhance the car park surface. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that all was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to write to the Cerney Wick Village Committee to 
 point out that the hedge at the entrance side needed to be cut back as it was 
 overgrown. Otherwise the play area was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DOG BINS</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce proposed that the Committee agreed to a request from Mrs Wilhelmina 
 M. Burgess of Sunnyside, Church Lane, Cerney Wick that a receptacle be placed 
 on the roadside by the kissing gate near her property. The Committee agreed and 
 the Clerk was asked to inform Mrs Burgess. The Committee agreed to a suggestion 
 from Cllr Harris that a bin be placed opposite the bellmouth at Kingfisher 
 Place, near to the entrance on the north side of the lane leading to the old 
 railway bridge. It was agreed that a further bin is placed at the entrance to 
 Gypsy Lane path, near to the motorcycle barrier, off Broadway Lane. Cllr Stuart 
 advised that care should be taken in the planting of the spike to hold the bin 
 as he strongly suspected that there were services in the vicinity. Cllr Caunce 
 will email the clerk with the suppliers coded descriptions of the bins to be 
 ordered.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to report that Watermark had 
 erected another advertising sign, outside its wire linked fence, at the corner 
 of Station Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reported that Mr R. Cunliffe had 
 informed her that new flooding problems had appeared after the downpour in the 
 middle of January, notably outside of Atkyns Manor and in the vicinity of Berry 
 Farm, Silver Street. Cllr Stuart had raised the problem with Gillian Portlock, 
 Gloucestershire Highways, when he met with her on Wednesday morning. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to enquire from Hartell NB 
 Construction if they would quote for the refurbishment of the Upper Up car 
 park. Neil Hartell had sent a letter introducing his company as a potential 
 contractor to the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had attended with 
 Cllr Jay, Cllr Harris and Dr Simon Pickering to reconnoitre suitable 
 biodiversity schemes within the village. The planting of a hedge to the west of 
 the cricket field at Upper Up was a project which had been identified and would 
 possibly be suitable for a £500 grant. Overall the scheme had been costed at 
 £643.90 which left a shortfall of £143.90 if the application for a grant was 
 successful. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart, seconded by Cllr Mrs Tunbridge that 
 the Committee recommends the expenditure of £143.90 to the Finance Committee 
 for its consideration. The Committee was in agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A quotation from Tree Maintenance Ltd to carry out a 
 survey of trees in the parish as detailed in our letter of 6th January for £290 
 (ex VAT) for its banding of up to 40 trees had been received. As the 
 contractors noted that 33 trees had been selected Cllr Harris would select a 
 further 7 and notify the Clerk of their location. The Committee recommends that 
 the Finance Committee accepts the quote from Tree Maintenance Ltd. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A final offer of £6,500 from Bloor Homes for the 
 maintenance of the public open space in Winchcombe Gardens had been received. 
 The Committee was concerned that the reward for the responsibilities was not 
 commensurate with the long term commitment. Questions raised included: what 
 kind of play equipment will be installed; who will inspect it; who will 
 maintain it; who will replace it; who will insure it; what sort of safety 
 surface will be installed with a similar range of questions - inspection, 
 maintenance, replacement, insurance. It is believed that by default, if the 
 Parish Council accepts any offer, it will be responsible and therefore the 
 Committee was not inclined to agree to the ‘final offer’. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During the course of the meeting all correspondence 
 concerning the Committee was discussed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As there was no further business Cllr Caunce had closed 
 the meeting at 8.20pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 11th
 FEBRUARY</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb had 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8:30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay had noted that the spread sheet was consistent 
 with its monthly percentage check on Parish Council expenditure. Employment of 
 the Clerk was anomalous as this year it included the total expense of his 
 employment and not only the wages paid as was the case previously.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed to the recommendation from the 
 Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee that it spends £143.90, 
 subject to obtaining a grant from the biodiversity fund, in the promotion of 
 its biodiversity scheme. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land 
 that the Parish Council agrees to the recommendation. Cllr Harris abstained. 
 The remainder of the Parish Council were all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed that the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee accepts the quotation for £290 from Tree Maintenance Ltd 
 to survey trees in the parish. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Walker 
 that the Parish Council agrees to accept the quotation. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A final offer of £6,500 from Bloor Homes for the 
 maintenance of the public open space in Winchcombe Gardens had been received. 
 The Finance Committee was concerned about the costs the Parish Council would 
 have to incur for maintenance and future replacement of the play equipment that 
 Bloor Homes is proposing to install. It is not clear whether the installation 
 of play equipment is a necessary commitment and clarification from Cotswold 
 District Council is awaited.</p>

 involvement in this and other schemes both now and in the future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Parish Council Flood Resilience Grant application</b>
 <br>
 An application for a Flood Resilience Grant was being prepared for presentation 
 to Cotswold District Council. The Clerk had sent a copy to Cllr Bennett (CDC) 
 for his scrutiny but understandably Cllr Bennett (CDC) had refused to comment 
 as he was part of the Committee responsible for awarding the grant. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Came &amp; Company Insurance Consultants proposed a new 
 Norwich Union Parish Council Insurance Scheme. The Clerk was to enquire from 
 them on its advantage over our current insurer. Any quotation would have to 
 cover all existing liabilities and especially to include the cycle mounds at 
 the Upper Up play area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A request from South Cerney Street Fair for support had 
 been received. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Webb that 
 the Committee recommends to the Parish Council that it agrees to make a payment 
 of £100 in support of the Annual Street Fair. The Committee was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;It was proposed by Cllr Walker and seconded by Cllr 
 Mrs Tunbridge that the Parish Council agrees to make the above grant. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Jay had closed the 
 meeting at 9.00pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COTSWOLD WATER PARK MASTER PLAN CONSULTATION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had circulated a condensed version of the 
 master plan, which was of particular interest to the residents of South Cerney 
 and Cerney Wick, to all parish councillors. He was concerned over the 
 implementation of the plan and asked for volunteers to join him to produce a 
 comprehensive response through the overview section in the consultation. There 
 was in his view a lot of emphasis on tourism and second homes in the document. 
 He was of the opinion that “enough is enough” in our parish and further second 
 home development should be curtailed. There should be encouragement to improve 
 the infrastructure especially footpaths and cycleways. One scheme worthy of 
 progress was the triangular route from South Cerney/Keynes Park/Siddington. 
 Cllr Harris, Cllr Jay in his capacity as Chairman of the South Cerney Trust, 
 Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Stuart, Cllr Walker and Cllr Webb would join Cllr Nicholas 
 on Wednesday 27th February at 7.30pm to decide on a response to the 
 consultation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) who is Chairman of the Joint Committee 
 stated that the plan out for consultation is an Area Action Plan for the entire 
 Waterpark and not a disparate one. Cllr Harris would like to see the large 
 gravel extraction companies made to put back funds for the restructuring of the 
 park. Cllr Parsons (GCC) did not totally agree as he argued that these firms 
 already contributed by paying their taxes which included a gravel tax. Central 
 government then dispenses the proceeds. Cllr Parsons (GCC) did agree however, 
 that there is a feeling from those who live in the area of being left out of 
 the loop</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>LOCAL FLOOD PLAN</b> Cllr Nicholas had identified two 
 items of concern which should be addressed. Firstly there was no overall policy 
 on the supply of sandbags. If a stock of sandbags was created then it was the 
 Parish Council who must decide who would receive them. During the heavy 
 rainfall in January, Gloucestershire Highways supplied sandbags to certain 
 parts of South Cerney but it would only react to a demand from the Parish 
 Council. Secondly there was a disjointed approach towards ditch clearance. CDC 
 is responsible and should enforce riparian owners to clear ditches. CDC has the 
 permissive power of enforcement. Cllr Bennett (CDC) stated that this was easier 
 said than done and before any enforcement policy was implemented it was much 
 better to try persuasion. Cllr Nicholas encouraged members of the Parish 
 Council to survey local ditches and report those considered in need of 
 clearance to Tim Dowan, newly appointed Flood Liaison Officer.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas noted that he had circulated to members of 
 the Parish Council a condensed version of the Water Park consultation document 
 as it applied to the parish. The long term Local Plan for the area is being 
 replaced with the Local Development Framework which will be an encouraging 
 process as it develops. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) had been involved in setting the County 
 Council’s forthcoming budget and had to report that it would be necessary to 
 impose a one-off levy for the flood damage in July. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb reported that some residents on the eastern side 
 of Broadway Lane had experienced raw sewage flowing through their gardens. 
 Thames Water had been not seemed to take any notice of the complainants. Cllr 
 Webb was advised to get them to contact the Environmental Health department at 
 CDC if the situation persists. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb noted that lorries were using the road off 
 Broadway Lane where Zycon has its offices on their way to discharge at Lake 16. 
 This activity was leaving a substantial deposit on the local carriageways and 
 as there were no planning conditions to enforce wheel washing he wanted the 
 PCSOs to take action to stop the practice. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay requested that the Clerk write to Roger Sollis, 
 CDC to ask him to arrange for the collection of the rubbish in the area of the 
 Fisherman’s Rest and La Farge works in Broadway Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris was not impressed with the new layout of the 
 Upper Up cycle mounds. The Clerk was asked to contact Stuart Milsom (MAI) and 
 request him to liaise with Murphys who were rebuilding the mounds to inform 
 them that they should be restored to a more usable condition. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that damage was occurring to 
 property in Cerney Wick. The Clerk informed her that all such incidents should 
 immediately be reported to 0845 090 1234. Cllr Parsons (GCC) reiterated that 
 each instance should be reported as this creates a profile and if the situation 
 persists then action by the police would be more likely. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land reported that Mrs J. Roberts had enquired 
 when the white lines delineating the footpath between the garage and the 
 chemist in Clarks Hay might be completed. The Clerk will enquire from Gillian 
 Portlock, Gloucestershire Highways. Mrs Roberts also asked what progress was 
 being made on plans to create a traffic calming measure at the bridge over the 
 Churn in Bridge Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS CONTRIBUTION </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to inform residents that the deadline 
 for responses on the Water Park consultation was 7th March. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 10.25pm.</p>
