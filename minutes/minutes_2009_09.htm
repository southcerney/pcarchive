 The Chairman of the meeting, Cllr Nicholas opened proceedings at 7.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
 Cllr Stuart informed the meeting that Cllr Peter Clarke (CDC) had resigned due
 to ill health. Parish Councillors agreed with Cllr Stuart who wished Cllr
 Clarke well and hoped that he would recover from his illness. An election had
 been requested and if contested, the poll will take place on Thursday, 17th
 September 2009.</p>

 12th AUGUST 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2578: <b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> 
 – 2nd line delete: inc insert: plus </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the minutes as amended were a true and accurate record. Members of 
 the Parish Council were all in favour. Cllr Harris abstained as he had not 
 attended the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There was no member of the Youth Parish Council present. 
 Both Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Jay had reported that they had not received any 
 response to emails. Cllr Mrs Land stated that the project would remain on hold 
 until the Youth Parish Council decided to take part in discussions. The Clerk 
 will contact Sinead Peare and try and persuade her to cooperate.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to enquire from the Village 
 Agent, Sue Black what progress she had made in advertising her services in 
 South Cerney and when the GRCC would be updated to include South Cerney in the 
 list of villages served by the scheme.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Throughout the period I have been in discussion with Paula 
 Sullivan and Lisa Chapman from the Directors’ Office of Thames Water trying to 
 resolve the problems encountered with the reinstatement at Upper Up and the 
 payment due. Bruton Knowles of Gloucester who act as agent for Thames Water 
 have challenged the account from Moore Allen and Innocent, agents for the 
 Parish Council. It is frustrating trying to motivate Bruton Knowles to instruct 
 their contractors to complete the reinstatement of the permissive path at the 
 western side of the playing fields but our agents are persevering. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During August of the 17 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours 45 minutes per day which is slightly more per week than the time 
 allowed in my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 7th SEPTEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had sent an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelters in Station Road</b>. The Committee agreed 
 to recommend to the Finance Committee that it consents to the cost of a 
 replacement perspex pane and its installation in the new bus shelter. The Clerk 
 was asked to remind the bus company to display a timetable within the shelter. 
 The electric light in the bus shelter at the Limes had been vandalised and the 
 Clerk was to ask suitable contractors to quote for its repair. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shorncote Link</b>. Discussions were proceeding, albeit 
 very slowly, with Bruton Knowles agents for Thames Water and Moore Allen and 
 Innocent agents for the Parish Council. It is recommended that the Parish 
 Council agrees to the following ultimatum which should be sent to Bruton 
 Knowles:<br>
 “Thames Water should be informed that, unless the Parish Council receives 
 written confirmation by 17th September that Thames Water will definitely carry 
 out the footpath flooding rectification works by the end of September, the 
 Parish Council will go ahead with the works itself and then add the cost of 
 those works to its outstanding claims against Thames Water. The Parish Council 
 will then instruct MAI to refer the full claim to the Lands Tribunal”. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Recent communications between the agents suggested that 
 work will start on Thursday 10th September to reinstate the outstanding areas 
 of the path at Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There followed a discussion which was classified as 
 “Commercially Sensitive Information” and a report is appended to these minutes 
 on a separate page. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported an incident of a horse using the path 
 from the Ashton Keynes road through the Upper Up playing field. He suggested 
 that a sign excluding horses should be erected but Cllr Nicholas argued that 
 the use of the path had probably been a one-off action and only if it persists 
 should a sign be erected. In the meantime Cllr Harris agreed that the situation 
 should be kept under surveillance.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow.</b> Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 remarked that it could set a precedent for others if Lady Fanshawe was not 
 written to regarding her overgrowing hedge. Nevertheless, the Committee did not 
 press the Clerk to write to her Ladyship at this time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Drop Kerbs.</b> Cllr Mrs Land will enquire from Paul 
 Swift, Gloucestershire Highways, when he expects the initial tactile drop kerbs 
 to be installed. Cllr Mrs Land had confirmed with Gloucestershire Highways that 
 the drop kerb in Clarks Hay was number one on the list and others will follow 
 when finance allows. Also, the MOT bays at the garage in Clarks Hay hopefully 
 will be moved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Car Parking in Berkeley Close.</b> Mr Lancaster had 
 emailed the Forum on the Parish Council web site complaining about the parking 
 arrangements in Berkeley Close. Cllr Kimberley understood that the houses in 
 Winchcombe Gardens were each allocated two parking spaces. Cllr Mrs Land had 
 already established that the parking bays outside the flats were not in the 
 gift of Fosseway Living but for public use although there was uncertainty if 
 this was in fact true as one person who had purchased a flat was convinced that 
 the deal had included a car parking space. The deeds were currently being 
 checked. The Clerk was asked to contact Mr Lancaster and request him to confirm 
 that properties in Winchcombe Gardens were each allocated two car parking 
 spaces or a garage as the case may be.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. The 
 fallen trees had been removed. The handles of the spinner which had been 
 vandalised were unsightly but not a hazard. Both Councillors reported that 
 everything else was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play equipment was all in order. The tree in the 
 hedge on the right as you enter the play area which needed its crown raising to 
 give better visibility had been attended to. The rubbish bin was full and 
 replacement signs were needed. The Clerk will make the necessary arrangements.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had emailed his report to the Clerk who apologised for subsequently 
 misplacing it. From memory the Clerk did not recall any outstanding problem 
 worth reporting. One of the memorial trees had died and would need replacing. 
 The ongoing saga with Bruton Knowles and Thames Water continued to frustrate 
 Cllr Stuart through lack of action to resolve the final issues. Acts of 
 vandalism persisted with the latest example of the Cricket Club’s steel 
 container being broken into and one of the mowers driven around the playing 
 field until it ran out of petrol.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to the purchase of a replacement perspex panel for the new bus shelter in the 
 region of £90 and the cost of installation to be determined by quotation. Also 
 the repair of the electric light in the bus shelter at the Limes with the work 
 to be carried out determined by quotation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The next recommendation was classified as “Commercially 
 Sensitive Information” and a report is appended to these minutes on a separate 
 page. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It is also recommended that the Finance Committee agrees 
 that if a lower quotation is received for the reinstatement of the Fenplay 
 safety surfaces and also the cleaning of the safety tiles at Cerney Wick it 
 should be accepted. Tenders should be sent out to suitable contractors to 
 requote for the extra jobs.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Field and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommends that the verbal quotations are accepted from F. Timbrell to flail 
 the hedge at Upper Up at a cost of £25 per hour and a day’s work by James 
 Harris Contracting to cut out heavier shrubs and tree limbs and remove all 
 debris occurring at a cost of £175 plus VAT.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley asked the Clerk to inform Ian Kennedy, 
 Chairman of the Scout Committee to arrange for the overgrowing hedge in 
 Berkeley Close to be cut back as it was hazardous to pedestrians using the 
 footpath. Since this incident had been reported the hedge had been cut back 
 although there were some bunches of nettles which also needed attention. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported that the handles on the spinner 
 play equipment at Robert Franklin Way play area had been vandalised. Cllr 
 Harris volunteered to inspect and report his findings to the meeting on 
 Wednesday. Cllr Harris reported that although unsightly he did not consider the 
 handles as a hazard. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a Cherry tree to the north of 
 the junction of Riverway and Clarks Hay had been damaged by a car accident. The 
 Committee was in agreement that the culprit should be liable for the cost of 
 its replacement. Cllr Harris will inform the Clerk on Wednesday of the name of 
 the person responsible. Cllr Harris had not been able to make contact but will 
 inform the Clerk when he has done so. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris requested that the Clerk enquire from Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) if he had determined who was responsible for the regulation of 
 the infilling of the lakes. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform the Environment 
 Agency that the stop planks from the Fanshawe Weir had been removed and were 
 now missing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb asked the Clerk to request Cotswold Hoburne 
 to cut back the overgrowing hedge on the eastern side of Broadway Lane where it 
 joins the B4696. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land reported that she had been in contact with 
 Les Haines regarding the parking problems being experienced in Berkeley Close. 
 Mr Haines had suggested that the Parish Council write to all residents in the 
 area to explain that parking should be amicably shared. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that the storm water grille outside 
 Avery Cottage in Silver Street was collapsing into the road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the stop cock in front of 
 Boxbush House in Station Road had also collapsed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON
 MONDAY 7th SEPTEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay thanked Cllr Webb for standing in for him at last 
 month’s meetings. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb made the report as Cllr Jay had apologised for 
 his absence from this meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that the expenditure detailed on the spread 
 sheet for period 5 was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee recommended that the 
 Finance Committee agrees to the purchase of a replacement perspex panel for the 
 new bus shelter in the region of £90 and the cost of installation to be 
 determined by quotation. Also the repair of the electric light in the bus 
 shelter at the Limes with the work to be carried out determined by quotation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Land and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Tunbridge that the Parish Council agrees to the recommendation above. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The next recommendation was classified as “Commercially 
 Sensitive Information” and a report is appended to these minutes on a separate 
 page. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It is also recommended that the Finance Committee agrees 
 that if a lower quotation is received for the reinstatement of the Fenplay 
 safety surfaces and also the cleaning of the safety tiles at Cerney Wick it 
 should be accepted. The Parish Council agreed that this business is put on hold 
 until further quotations have been received. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Field and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the verbal quotations are accepted from F. Timbrell to flail 
 the hedge at Upper Up at a cost of £25 per hour and a day’s work by James 
 Harris Contracting to cut out heavier shrubs and trees and remove all debris 
 occurring at a cost of £175 plus VAT. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee had not objected to any of the above 
 recommendations. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr 
 Nicholas that the Parish Council agrees to this recommendation. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters arising</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Pavement frontage to Old Post Office, High Street
 (CT.1239 and CT.1241)</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas reported that negotiations with Gloucestershire Highways and the 
 developer on the redesign of the entrance and pavement area had been mostly 
 successful evidenced by the work which had been carried out. There was concern 
 that there was no demarcation of the footpath to signify the priority of the 
 footpath over vehicle access. The Parish Council asked the Clerk to thank Paul 
 Swift and the team at Gloucestershire Highways for their cooperation in a good 
 job well done.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>06/00525/FUL CT.2648/3/P Planning Conditions for Waters 
 Edge, Lake 10 and CT.4498/W Four Pillars Hotel Conditions</b> <br>
 In correspondence item 21 in respect of planning conditions at Four Pillars 
 there is implied criticism in the 4th paragraph of Gloucestershire Highways. 
 Similarly in the Waters Edge response, correspondence item 20 referred that the 
 2nd and 4th paragraphs allege that it is Gloucestershire Highways which is 
 holding up matters. The Clerk was to ask Cllr Parsons (GCC) that the Planning 
 Committee would like to know what is being done to rectify the situation. The 
 Clerk was also asked to inform Andrew Fotherby that his response was very 
 informative and to thank him for his efforts.</p>

 Act to help engage people in politics. The original Act became law but in the 
 final days of the Act being passed Local Councils were omitted from the process 
 by Whitehall officials. The Parish Council debated asking Geoffrey Clifton-
