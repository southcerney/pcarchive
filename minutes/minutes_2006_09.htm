 Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Youth Parish Councillors Joe Lodge, Thomas Nicholas and 
 Rebecca King attended the meeting. Thomas Nicholas informed the Parish Council 
 that the YPC was researching the possibility of installing a sports wall at the 
 Upper Up playing fields. Joe Lodge asked for Parish Council volunteers to 
 attend one of their meetings on 3rd October. Parish Councillors Jay and Squire 
 agreed to attend. The postponed Fun Run would now take place on 29th October 
 and although the YPC will organise the event they cannot manage it and need a 
 volunteer. The group was concerned how they could recover their incidental 
 office expenses such as telephone, paper and printer cartridge costs. The Clerk 
 was asked to make the request an agenda item for the Finance Committee at its 
 October meeting. Regarding the need for a Risk Assessment, Cllr Caunce informed 
 the YPC members that this was not mandatory but an idea Claire Dowan had 
 introduced. He invited the YPC to respond to an invitation he had issued 
 through the message board on the web site to discuss the situation. Members of 
 the YPC then left the meeting.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 14th August I met with Cllr Webb to discuss 
 Appendix 5: Wiltshire &amp; Swindon Sites Allocations DPD Issues &amp; Options Report: 
 Response Form. As the time for reply had long since expired Cllr Webb asked 
 that I enquire from the Chief Executive at CDC if it had made any reply to the 
 “Issues and Options”. A response would have included the District Council in 
 the process of producing the Wiltshire and Swindon Waste Sites Allocation 
 Development Plan Document. If this was the case I was to request a copy of its 
 response. The two particular areas of interest to South Cerney with Cerney Wick 
 Parish Council are Barnground, South Cerney (actually in Wiltshire) and the 
 Cotswold Community (also in Wiltshire). A reply from CDC is in correspondence. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Guy Wakefield of Hunter Page representing Bloor Homes 
 asked if the Parish Council would be prepared to maintain the public open space 
 on his client’s development in Berkeley Close on a similar basis as that which 
 was agreed with Westbury Homes on the Limes. Westbury Homes paid the Parish 
 Council £13,000 for the improvement of play areas on the Limes in lieu of play 
 equipment and the transfer of land for future maintenance under a Section 106 
 Agreement between Westbury Homes, Cotswold District Council and South Cerney 
 Parish Council. By email I indicated that the Parish Council might be persuaded 
 but there were outstanding concerns on breaches of the conditions regarding the 
 development which should be addressed. His reply is in Correspondence item 23. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 8th September I accompanied Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire 
 to two meetings. At 9.30am we met with Chris Franklin and discussed traffic 
 problems in Broadway Lane in the vicinity of Londis. Various ideas were 
 discussed but the only positive decision was to change the Give Way sign at the 
 junction of Berkeley Close and Broadway Lane to a Halt sign. At 10.45am we met 
 Emma Hoyle Environment Agency and Gavin Robins from the Regional Flood 
 Forecasting section to discuss the positioning of the kiosk. After looking at 
 another site down stream Ms Hoyle and Mr Robins intimated that a site in the 
 vicinity of the Fanshawe Weir would be considered. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During August of the 22 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours 45 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay informed the Parish Council that the sandwich 
 advertising board at the Old George public house had been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas informed the Parish Council that the 
 Chairman had asked him to report on the introduction of the new speed limits on 
 the Silver Street to Preston Toll Bar road which were mostly adhered to but 
 there were still drivers who were ignoring them. The Clerk had written to the 
 traffic officer at Gloucestershire Constabulary and requested that a speed 
 check be made on the road. Cllr Jay noted it was incongruous that after passing 
 Worms Farm the limit northward increased from 40mph to 50mph soon followed with 
 a “slow” sign painted on the carriageway to warn of the coming junction. After 
 the junction the road narrowed where it passed roadside residences and a bend. 
 This stretch from Worms Farm onwards was in Siddington Parish and the Clerk was 
 to ask it to consider requesting Gloucestershire Highways to reduce the speed 
 limit from 50mph to 40mph along the stretch from its border with South Cerney 
 to Preston Toll Bar.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 11th September. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Speed Limits</b> <br>
 Alterations to the speed limits on the Silver Street to Preston Toll Bar had 
 been carried out. The 30mph sign at the entrance to the village in Silver 
 Street had been moved approximately 200 metres north. The Clerk reported that 
 Cllr Stuart had asked him to write to Gloucestershire Constabulary and request 
 them to carry out speed checks on vehicles using the road because, in his 
 opinion, many drivers were not obeying the new limits. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris had not yet made contact with a skip hire firm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Lady Fanshawe’s Hedge</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to contact Gillian Portlock and insist that action is taken 
 soon to reduce the overgrowth of Lady Fanshawe’s hedge in Bow Wow. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cricket Club Drainage Work</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris wished it to be minuted that it was discourteous of the Cricket 
 Club not to inform the Parish Council of its decision to level and drain the 
 cricket outfield. The Committee decided that it would not serve any purpose to 
 write to the Cricket Club about the matter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Flow Meter in School Lane</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported on a meeting held on Friday 8th September with members of 
 the Environment Agency – Gavin Robins and Emma Hoyle, Cllr Squire and Cllr 
 Stuart. The preferred site was inside the stone building owned by Geoff Andrews 
 in School Lane. If securing the right to use this building proved 
 insurmountable another site in the vicinity of the Fanshawe Weir would suffice 
 depending on the agreement of the technical team at the Environment Agency. 
 Emma Hoyle promised to keep the Parish Council informed about developments. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Reinstatement of river bank in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported on a verbal reply Martyn Summerell, Gloucestershire Highways 
 Area Highways Manager East had made concerning the reinstatement of the river 
 Churn’s bank in Bow Wow. Mr Summerell accepted that it was his department’s 
 responsibility but would welcome input from the Parish Council in the form of a 
 supervisory role. He stated that he was prepared to finance the project in two 
 tranches of £5,000 in this financial year and the next providing that the 
 Payback in the Community Team would be available. The Committee recommends the 
 Parish Council agrees that the Clerk writes to Mr Summerell stating if 
 Gloucestershire Highways purchases and delivers the necessary materials to the 
 site and coordinates labour of the Pay Back in the Community teams the Parish 
 Council would provide the necessary supervision. James Harris Contracting had 
 forwarded a quotation to train such teams and supervisors on the installation 
 method and make quality control visits as necessary for a fee of £800 per year 
 of the project. James Harris Contracting emphasised that this would not be full 
 time on-site management.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that everything on the playing field was in order. He 
 promised to supply his confirming paperwork.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
 Cllr Harris had noted that three bolts on the engine hoop of the Train Unit 
 will need replacing soon. On the 360 degree Swing there is definite movement 
 and noise coming from the anchor points. He would like Parish Councillors to 
 inspect the kit and recommend what action, if any, should be taken. The Goal 
 Post area will need soil this autumn. Tree and shrub cover needs to be cut back 
 during the winter and branches overhanging the bridlepath will need lifting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b><br>
 The Clerk read an emailed report from Cllr Stuart as follows: “I have inspected 
 the site and equipment several times over the month and for the most part 
 everything is OK with the exception that there has been more vandalism to the 
 cricket pavilion where the remaining rails have been kicked out and a section 
 of roof soffit has been pushed in. The Club is aware but I have no idea if they 
 have reported it to the police. The cricket out field has had a big section 
 ploughed, cleared of top soil and is now being drained all at the expense of 
 the cricket club. The objective is to level the previously undulating field. 
 The football club have repositioned their two junior pitches still within the 
 agreed overall space we let them have. Also, within the past couple of days 
 they have carried out a great clean up operation and have cut back a load of 
 dense undergrowth against Berry’s field. Although I have always been in favour 
 of dog owners being permitted to exercise their animals in the playing field, 
 far too many are not cleaning up after their pets. Perhaps we could get some 
 well worded notices saying that unless there is an improvement then all dogs 
 will be banned from the park? On Thursday morning I noticed that there are two 
 or more large limbs fallen off a willow on the far hedge beyond the lake. None 
 have damaged any of our new trees but they could do with cutting up. Also, 
 someone has burnt a hole in one of the picnic tables probably with a large 
 candle as there is wax close to the burnt area. This is not a major problem but 
 needs recording. I asked Derek Higginson who was working with the digger driver 
 if they would take a small load of top soil to the play equipment area for us 
 to level around the swings etc. Hopefully this will be done later today.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris recommended that the item on dog mess on the 
 playing field should appear in the next issue of Cerney News. Parish 
 Councillors voiced their disgust at irresponsible dog owners who did not clean 
 up after their pets. The Parish Council was in agreement that if the situation 
 did not improve a more restrictive regime, ordering all persons walking dogs on 
 the playing fields to keep to the gravel path and to have their pets on a lead, 
 would be enforced. Cllr Harris had given his permission to the Cricket Club for 
 overburden and a tree stump to be dumped to the right hand rear of the humps 
 and bumps in an area which is not mown. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in 
 Berkeley Close</b> <br>
 Based on the amount agreed on the Limes development, Guy Wakefield (Hunter Page 
 Associates) on behalf of Bloor Homes had suggested that the Parish Council 
 accepted £15,000 to maintain the public open space on its development. After 
 some discussion it was agreed Mr Wakefield is made aware it is the experience 
 of the Parish Council that it is increasingly expensive to maintain such areas. 
 The Committee agreed with Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council will need to 
 know the exact area to be maintained, whether or not there will be trees 
 involved and what the state of the area will be on transfer.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Councillors’ Reports</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk read an emailed report from Cllr Stuart as 
 follows: “On Friday 8th, I attended a meeting of the Cotswold Play Partnership 
 at the CDC offices. This group are responsible from the application to obtain 
 the £200K grant available from (to all intents and purposes) central government 
 even though it is I seem to remember from the Big Lottery Fund. The money will 
 be used to improve play facilities in the CDC area. I am impressed by the way 
 in which the team of professionals from various organisations are getting on 
 with the job. Headed by Rosemary Lynn ably assisted by Claire Dowan both of the 
 CDC a tremendous amount of detail has been collated concerning what the CDC 
 area already has in the way of play ground and other facilities for youngsters. 
 You would have thought that such a task would have been easy. I did and had 
 recommended at a previous meeting that all that was needed was a small 
 questionnaire to be sent to every town and parish council in the district 
 asking them to complete it and send it back as soon as possible. I asked the 
 Clerk if I could see and complete the form when it arrived. The job took me 
 less than 10 minutes and we have three playgrounds to report on. Many parishes 
 have much less. I was dismayed when I found out that out of the 114 councils 
 contacted by our team, only 74 have returned the documents and a further 8 have 
 contacted the office to say that as they either have no children or no 
 playground facilities they were not returning the questionnaire. I was told 
 that District Councillors are to chase those who have not assisted but even so, 
 there will be a relatively short time for the team to compile all the facts and 
 more importantly to prepare a application for the grant. The requirements 
 regarding the application set up by the source of the fund are very complicated 
 and will take a lot of work. GRCC are supplying excellent input by way of 
 analysing the results of the survey and two of their members have volunteered 
 to be in the small group to set up the draft ‘strategy’. Our next meeting is on 
 8th November and we are aiming to get the application completed and lodged by 
 next March. This is a far more complicated task than I thought it would be when 
 I attended the first meeting and it is not one that has been over cooked by 
 those doing it, the fault is in the requirements of those supplying the money.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris pointed out that the hedge surrounding the 
 playing fields at Upper Up need to be flayed. Cllr Mrs Chubb was asked to 
 enquire if Mr Chubb would be prepared to do the work although she was not 
 confident that he would agree. Cllr Harris had spoken to Mr F. Timbrell who 
 agreed to flay the hedge at a cost of £20 per hour. Cllr Harris asked the Clerk 
 to report that the stop cock cover opposite Huxley Court in Station Road was 
 missing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported that the direction bollards in Station 
 Road, opposite Greystones had been removed and replaced three times in the last 
 10 days. Numerous vehicles had been damaged after colliding with the base and 
 in one incident a vehicle had lost its wheel which had travelled towards 
 children waiting at the near by bus stop. Fortunately no one was injured.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on 11th September.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising <br>
 </b>Gordon Stratford had verbally enquired from Cllr Jay why the Football Club 
 had to pay 60% of the water bill while the Cricket Club paid the lesser 40%. 
 The Clerk explained that this agreement was historical and the formula had been 
 in force prior to his appointment some 8 years ago based on notional usage.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Public Open Space at Bloor Homes’ development in 
 Berkeley Close</b> <br>
 It should be stressed to Mr Wakefield (Hunter Page Associates), acting on 
 behalf of Bloor Homes, of the high cost of play surface maintenance and 
 replacement, the continual grass cutting and associated tree maintenance. The 
 Committee recommends that provided adequate recompense is agreed the Parish 
 Council should be minded to accept responsibility for the maintenance of the 
 public open space at Bloor Homes’ development although it considers the first 
 offer inadequate.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in this item 
 as a potential contractor and left the room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Reinstatement of river bank in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 The Committee agreed to support the deliberations of the Playing Fields and 
 Village Maintenance Committee with regard to the quotation from James Harris 
 Contracting to supervise the reinstatement work on the river bank at a cost of 
 £800 per year of the project. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr 
 Webb that the Parish Council agrees with the recommendation of the Finance 
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>

 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the 
 Planning Committee which had met on 11th September. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Waste Disposal</b> <br>
 The Clerk explained that after a meeting with Cllr Webb he had enquired from 
 CDC on its response to the Issues and Options as described in Appendix 5: 
 Wiltshire and Swindon Waste Sites Allocation Development Plan Document. In a 
 reply, Mrs Nicola Melville, Senior Planner at CDC supported in principle, as an 
 officer, an increase in inert waste recycling as long as it was associated with 
 the landfill inputs and subject to the planning issues identified in the site 
 profiles being addressed. It was a concern that only Sites 31 and 32 were 
 mentioned. Cllr Webb noted that no response regarding Site 30, which was the 
 nearest to the village, had been forthcoming. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Breach of Second Homes Occupancy Conditions</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas enquired if there was an outcome of the enforcement action 
 brought by CDC for the use dwellings as primary residence in breach of second 
 home conditions. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) informed the Parish Council that the 
 first 8 actions would come before the Planning Committee next week. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Breach of Conditions on Bloor Homes development</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb was concerned with the delegated response given by Colin Davis, 
 Planning Enforcement Officer to a letter which detailed several instances of 
 breaches of Conditions on Bloor Homes’ development in Berkeley Close. He 
 queried the logic of imposing conditions and for the Planning Authority at CDC 
 then to ignore them when breached. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Breach of Conditions on Lake 11 development <br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) assured the Parish Council that if Colin Davies was 
 informed about vehicles leaving the site and depositing mud on the road he 
 would investigate. The Clerk was asked to insert his contact details in the 
 Cerney News. Enforcement officers at CDC, Colin Davies or Michael Grace, could 
 be contacted by telephone on Cirencester 623001 or email

 Amended Plans: Construction of a motel with car park (revised scheme) The 
 amended plans do not overcome the reasons for the previous objections made by 
 South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council, namely: The proposed motel 
 development would fundamentally change the character of this rural location, as 
 viewed from the adjoining footpaths. The Parish Council is concerned as to the 
 precise appearance of the proposed buildings. The amended plans still show no 
 details describing the roof colour to be used. Permission should not be granted 
 until the sewage problems affecting South Cerney have been resolved. Conditions 
 requested if permission is granted as follows: 1. A wheel wash to be mandatory 
 for all vehicles exiting the site during construction. 2. A dedicated lane 
 should be installed, to allow traffic accessing the motel to turn right safely. 
 3. A reduction in the Spine Road speed limit, from 50 mph to 40 mph. <br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/R <br>
 </b>Applicant: Watermark Ltd, Isis Lakes, The Spine Road, South Cerney<br>
 Amended Plans: Construction of an office building for the use of Watermark in 
 association with their surrounding leisure facilities (re-submission) at Lake 
 11, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney<br>
 Planning permission has just been granted for 50 holiday houses on Lake 11, 
 (pursuant to Decision Notice CT.2648/3/J). If consent is granted, then the 
 Parish Council proposes the following conditions: 1. The proposed new vehicular 
 access from Cerney Wick Lane, on the south eastern side of the site of the 50 
 holiday houses (referred to as ‘Access 3’ on page 15 of the Transport 
 Assessment (TA) dated April 2006) will cause an unacceptable increase in the 
 volume of traffic using this minor road. Therefore vehicular access to the 50 
 houses should be direct from the B4696 ‘Spine Road’, and run through the site 
 of the proposed Watermark office development. 2. The 1999 and 2002 traffic 
 surveys referred to in the TA are not sufficiently recent. The Parish Council 
 is very concerned about the inevitable increase in traffic volumes that will be 
 generated by the 50 holiday houses, and by all the other proposed substantial 
 developments in the area which have extant planning permissions. Therefore, the 
 road junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Station Road and the Spine Road must now be 
 re-designed to accept the traffic increase. The junction should be 
 fundamentally improved and upgraded in the interests of safety, with traffic 
 lights included, as described in paragraph 4.12 of the TA. This issue has now 
 become very important. 3. A public pedestrian and cycle path should be included 
 as part of these developments, right around the south western and south eastern 
 perimeter of the site, and onwards to Cerney Wick. Having considered the TA, 
 and also bearing in mind all the existing developments which have planning 
 permission in the area, the overall traffic levels along the Spine Road and 
 down Cerney Wick Lane will increase substantially. Much greater attention will 
 need to be paid to all aspects of road safety. Cerney Wick Lane is already 
 hazardous for road users, particularly walkers, cyclist and horse riders. 4. 
 The Parish Council remains very concerned that the public main sewerage 
 infrastructure in South Cerney must first be proven to be capable of 
 accommodating the additional volumes that will be created by this development. 
 5. The existing earth bund along the south eastern boundary of the site should 
 only be removed if an appropriate condition is included to prevent undue noise 
 (such as public address sound systems) from these sites. The bund currently 
 provides a sound barrier, reducing the level of noise from Lake 11 (and from 
 the Spine Road) that reaches the residents of Cerney Wick. 6. The Parish 
 Council is concerned that the documents provided to the Parish Council contain 
 no indication as to the colour or texture of the roofing tiles, walls or other 
 such external materials to be used for the buildings on these developments.<br>
