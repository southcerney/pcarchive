    of extending the stone wall surrounding the graveyard. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish Council was minded to contribute a
    sum of £1,000­£2,500 for the proposed extension. The Parish Council was all in favour.
    The Clerk was asked to inform Rev J. Calvert of this decision.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart who had deputised for Cllr Harris in his absence at the Committee meeting
    reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance Committee
    which had met on7 January.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    Disabled Access at Upper Up The Clerk had been informed by T. Sibbick that he intended to
    start construction of the Disabled Access at Upper Up in the week beginning 27 May.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CCTV Survey</strong><br>
    A copy of the survey carried out by Three Counties Drainage Services of the drain between
    the Old Police Station on Station Road to west of the Langet had been passed to M.
    Summerell GCC Highways for his comments. His advice was requested on what the next course
    of action should be. Cllr Gardiner had spoken with T. Sandell, past Chairman of the Parish
    Council, who confirmed that the old Rural District Council had been responsible for
    installing the drain.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bus Shelter Repair</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner had contacted Mr Clive Symcox and work on the repairs of the bus shelter for
    which he had quoted will be carried out next week.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Manhole Cover outside old Police Station</strong><br>
    The Clerk informed the Committee that the drain cover was the responsibility of the
    Westbury Homes as it had not yet been formally adopted by GCC Highways and was therefore
    their responsibility. The developers had been informed and loose drain cover had been
    repaired.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village of the Year Prizes</strong><br>
    The Parish Council agreed that the £250 award from Calor Gas Ltd be used to provide a
    plaque for the seat in Bow Wow to commemorate the achievement, with the balance of the
    award used to purchase new armed chairs for the Village Hall. It was agreed to spend the
    £100 award on bulbs. Cllr Mrs Spriggs would contact residents in Silver Street to
    ascertain what their reactions would be if some of the bulbs were planted in and around
    the lime trees. Cllr Stuart reported that the Gardening Club would be pleased to advise on
    where to plant the remainder of the bulbs.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Reinstatement of Verges</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform GCC Highways that the pavement on the river side of the
    junction of Silver Street and School Lane required reinstatement.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Street Lighting</strong><br>
    The Clerk had informed B. Greenaway at GCC Street Lighting that the new lights in Bow Wow
    and opposite the Scout Hut in Berkeley Close were not working.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Stile on BSC17</strong><br>
    Maintenance of stiles and fences on PROWs was the responsibility of the landowner. As the
    owner was recently deceased it was decided that further action was premature.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Car Parking at Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart said that as work was about to start on the new pavilion it was an opportunity
    to refurbish and enlarge the car park. Plans that had been drawn up for the extended car
    park were to be sent to A. C. Nurden Ltd, T. &amp; D. Construction, J. Woodhouse and P.
    Purvey Ltd for quotations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Deteriorating Road Surfaces</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner said that road surfaces throughout the village were deteriorating. The Clerk
    was asked to report to D. Taylor GCC Highways that repairs were especially needed to
    Station Road and the junction of Broadway Lane and High Street at the Memorial by Corner
    Cottage.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Moles Return</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported that moles had returned to the playing field at Upper Up and asked
    the Clerk to contact Able Pest Control.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on his playground inspections. The seats on the senior swings at
    Upper Up and Cerney Wick need replacing. The leading edge of the slide at Upper Up was
    damaged and required attention. Cllr Gardiner volunteered to inspect and his
    recommendation is awaited. The paint on the backing board of the basketball net was being
    worn away. Cllr Stuart reported that rubbish was accumulating at Robert Franklin Way
    playing field. At Cerney Wick leaves and other debris were accumulating on the safety
    tiles and needed sweeping off. Cllr Mrs Chubb would carry out the next round of
    inspections. Cllr Harris reported that Mr Fairbrother Chairman of the Cerney Wick Village
    Hall Committee would arrange the supply of 12 posts to renovate the fence. A working party
    of other villagers would concrete them in place. Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that Mr Caunce
    would arrange for the removal of the dead elm at the Cerney Wick playing fields. Cllr Mrs
    Chapman had swept the debris off the safety tiles.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PRECEPT</strong><br>
    The Finance Committee which had met on Thursday 3 January presented their precept proposal
    to the Parish Council on 9 January. Discussions centred on whether to increase the budget
    from £2,000 to £15,000 for the proposed park in Upper Up in the coming financial year.
    If agreed this would mean that the precept would be £46,000 making a contribution of
    £35.63 per band OD' household. This represented an annual increase of £10.94 or 30.7%.
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas, seconded by Cllr Gardiner that the Parish Council agrees
    to the increase in the budget. Nine Parish Councillors voted in favour and 2 abstained.
    The increase was therefore agreed.<br>
