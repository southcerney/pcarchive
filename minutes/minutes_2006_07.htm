 14th JUNE 2006</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the Minutes were a true and accurate record. With the exception of 
 Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Pollard and Cllr Webb who were all absent from the 
 meeting the remainder of the Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Rachael King and Sinead Peare jointly informed the Parish 
 Council that many meetings had been held in the previous month. A Fun Run was 
 being organised to take place on 10th September and a competition to create a 
 logo for the YPC was on going. Cllr Stuart sincerely thanked all members of the 
 YPC who had attended the Calor Gas Village of the Year judging on Tuesday 11th 
 June in the Village Hall. He was sure that the judges were highly impressed 
 with the turnout and attitude of the group. The Clerk informed the YPC that he 
 would deliver the memory stick in the near future. Cllr Jay reminded the two 
 YPC members that a “Sports Taster Day” was planned to take place at the South 
 Cerney Cricket Club in August and other events were published recently in the 
 Cerney News under the title “Great News for Young People”.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As instructed I contacted GCC Library Service regarding 
 the availability of the National Funding Report without success. Other funding 
 books were available although they were for reference only and not available on 
 loan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 26th June I met Natasha McKenna, Grant 
 Co-ordinator at CDC for advice on how to access the Community Fund. I was 
 interested in applying for funds to install the MUGA. My meeting was worthwhile 
 and Ms McKenna explained how to make the application. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 3rd July I joined Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb to 
 discuss the siting of the zebra crossing in High Street with Daniel Robertson 
 of Gloucestershire Highways. Mr Robertson listened sympathetically to the 
 complaint that the objections were taking an inordinate length of time to 
 resolve. He would not be committed to an installation time schedule but 
 promised to contact the objectors to see if any solutions might be found. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During June of the 20 available working days I averaged 4 
 hours 35 minutes per day which exceeds my contract by about an hour per day. I 
 am quite happy with the current agreement and with more diligence on my part 
 could probably make the work fit the time.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no matters arising which were not being dealt 
 with through the Committees’ reports.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on the deliberations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 10th July. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology </b><br>
 Cllr Squire had made an apology for his absence because he was on holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cotswold Play Partnership</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting he had attended on 20th June at CDC regarding 
 the awarding of grants. There were numerous bureaucratic hoops to be gone 
 through before grants would be awarded but Cllr Stuart was hopeful of a 
 successful outcome but it would not be in the near term.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Honey Combed Safety Surface</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that he had pegged down the loose sheets and would make 
 good at a later date.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Highway Matters</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart, Cllr Webb and the Clerk attended a meeting arranged by Daniel 
 Robertson, Gloucestershire Highways to discuss the pedestrian crossing in High 
 Street. Cllr Stuart expressed his anger that Mr Robertson was not aware of the 
 history of the installation. It was agreed that Mr Robertson would communicate 
 with the two known objectors and try and persuade them to change their minds. 
 When Cllr Webb asked him how long before the crossing would be installed he 
 indicated that it could be a year before work might begin. In reply to a 
 question as to when the interactive speed signs would be erected he replied 
 possibly within three months. He was also unsure as to when the changes to the 
 speed limit signs on the Silver Street to Preston Toll Bar road might be made 
 although the order had been promulgated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After the meeting the Clerk had informed Cllr Parsons (GCC) 
 specifically pointing out that consultation on the crossing in High Street had 
 been on going for more than two years, the work on the Cirencester road speed 
 sign alterations had been agreed and the order for implementation approved and 
 an invoice had been received in March for the interactive speed signs. The 
 delays were unacceptable. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart added that this item was a very important part 
 of this meeting. Before attending tonight’s meeting Cllr Stuart had spoken to 
 Mr Rob Vale, Gloucestershire Highways Asset Manager who agreed that the time 
 delay in implementing the speed limits was taking far too long. He reaffirmed 
 that the interactive speed signs were in store although he would have to liaise 
 with Mr John Whittaker his predecessor as to where exactly and once located he 
 would ensure that installation would be in weeks rather than months. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At the meeting with Mr Daniel Robertson, Gloucestershire 
 Highways regarding the installation of the pedestrian crossing it was 
 determined that Mr Robertson would reappraise the entire scheme and contact 
 those residents who had previously objected to its positioning. Cllr Stuart 
 pointed out that the Police had suggested that the siting should be in the High 
 Street about 30 metres east of the junction with Broadway Lane. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A discussion ensued with Mr S. Beard complaining that he 
 was not informed of the latest meeting. The debate was abridged when Cllr 
 Stuart reiterated that the Parish Council had voted in favour of the scheme. 
 Nevertheless the Clerk was asked to inform Ann Edwards School of the 
 difficulties and delays being experienced and suggest that it re-advertises the 
 post of “Lollypop Lady” for a crossing point in High Street.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 The Pay Back in the Community group would carry out the work on the slide as 
 soon as possible.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cricket Club Pavilion <br>
 </b>The Committee recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to awarding the 
 Cricket Club a donation of £100 in recognition of the encouragement it was 
 fostering with youth cricket in the village.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Tennis Club</b><br>
 The Tennis Club wrote to inform the Parish Council that repair to the 
 flagstones was in hand. It suggested that vandalism in the area might be curbed 
 if the cctv was reinstalled. Cllr Stuart had informed members of both the 
 Tennis and Cricket clubs that as very few incidents of vandalism were reported 
 it was perceived by the authorities that there was not a problem. There was 
 only one camera available in the district and competition for it was high. He 
 will continue to encourage residents to complain to the police on 0845 090 1234 
 when unsocial behaviour warrants such action. The Tennis Club raised the 
 possibility of creating another court to make a total of three. The Committee 
 was minded to agree as Cllr Caunce commented that the objective should be to 
 make the best available use of the land. The Committee suggest that the third 
 court could be accommodated alongside the existing setting by latterly 
 extending the playing surface either side, that is towards the Cricket Club 
 pavilion on the one side and Walnut Tree Farmhouse on the other. The Parish 
 Council was in favour and the Clerk was asked to inform the Tennis Club 
 accordingly.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the new signs which had been placed at the entrance 
 to the play area needed to be replaced as they were damaged in a recent storm. 
 The rest of the play area was in good order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported the area underneath the fencing surrounding the toddlers 
 play area had been strimmed. Although not an issue at the moment the corner of 
 the floor of one of the carriages was showing signs of rot. The tower slide was 
 “tired”.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the Probation Service team had carried out some work 
 to the edges of the play surfaces around senior swing and activity area but it 
 was not satisfactory. A supply of top soil would need to be sourced. Users of 
 the cycle mounds have agreed to cut the very long grass on areas they use and 
 the Clerk was asked to request Adrian Gibbs to strim the rest.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a willow limb was hanging 
 dangerously over the carriageway, on the right, in Bow Wow beyond the public 
 seat. The Clerk will report it to Gloucestershire Highways. Although the 
 foregoing work had been carried out Cllr Jay reported that another branch was 
 in a similar condition. Cllr Harris requested that Gillian Portlock, 
 Gloucestershire Highways was reminded that Lady Fanshawe’s hedge was still 
 causing problems and needed to be cut back. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the hornbeam tree in Clarks Hay 
 had succumbed and needed to be removed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire, Cllr Stuart, Cllr Harris and Cllr Jay had met 
 with Gillian Portlock (Gloucestershire Highways) to discuss what action was 
 needed to stabilise the river bank in Bow Wow. The Payback in the Community 
 team was prepared to do the work if a specification could be provided. Cllr 
 Harris had obliged in producing a plan with costings for Gloucestershire 
 Highways. It had indicated that the work could be completed in one go if the 
 Parish Council was prepared to contribute. After a discussion the Committee was 
 not minded to recommend this course of action to the Parish Council. The Clerk 
 was asked to write to Martyn Summerell suggesting that Gloucestershire Highways 
 considers reimbursing James Harris for the time and expertise he furnished 
 Gloucestershire Highways in providing a specification for the reinstatement of 
 the river bank in Bow Wow. Concern was expressed as to the supervision of the 
 Pay Back in the Community team which would be carrying out the work. The Parish 
 Council is worried that this particularly sensitive and fragile part of the 
 village infrastructure might be irrevocably damaged if careful control of the 
 repair party is not adequate.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported on the discussions of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on 10th July.</p>

 Cerney News. The Clerk would send the survey to Sinead Barker (GRCC) for her
