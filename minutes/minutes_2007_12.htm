    <p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 12th DECEMBER 2007</strong>.</p>

    <p align="left">Prior to the Parish Council meeting Mary Mychaleckyj, 
    Central Cotswolds Youth Worker and Emily Whitehead, Young Gloucestershire 
    charity worker were welcomed to a meeting of Parish Councillors by Chairman 
    Cllr M. Stuart. Mary and Emily both enthusiastically explained their roles 
    with the local youngsters which generally they had divided, for ease of 
    management into two groups: one from those aged 8-13 and the other for 14 
    and over. Contact had been made with 38 young people and their parents. They 
    had met with others who could not be included in the statistics as they were 
    not prepared to reveal their details. A survey was carried out to find out 
    the perceived needs which only reinforced the requirement for a youth 
    provision in South Cerney. The ladies were confident that through regular 
    contact with the youth a rapport and trust will be established. Contact had 
    also been made with the travelling community and the plan is to treat this 
    group separately but eventually as trust develops they will join with 
    youngsters from the village. Meeting facilities are very limited although 
    the landlord of the Royal Oak lets the group use part of his premises for 
    gratis. This is not ideal as some parents object to the location. With 
    minimal guidance youngsters had been successful in applying for a grant from 
    the Youth Opportunity Fund and had been offered £1,000. Particular emphasis 
    is to encourage young people to make the decisions about the content of the 
    activities and sessions they undertake. This empowers them to take ownership 
    and develops responsibility. Currently there are two volunteers undergoing 
    CRB checks and if successful will help and support the project. Provision of 
    space for the 8-13 age group is a high priority which must be addressed. 
    There is evidence that the older group 14-19 year olds have a need for 
    information, advice and a safe place to meet and relax. Hugh Gladman from 
    St. James’ Place in Cirencester who is a trustee for Young Gloucestershire 
    has indicated that he is interested in providing funding for a youth 
    provision in the Cirencester area. He has offered to match fund grants 
    offered to the group from the Parish Council. Cllr Nicholas replied that he 
    was very impressed with the talk given by the two ladies and could 
    personally identify with the plans and problems as he had young children. He 
    noted how opportune the presentation was in relation to the proximity of the 
    deliberations on the precept. The Parish Councillors agreed with his 
    suggestion that Mary Mychaleckyj acts as catalyst between all the groups. 
    Cllr Stuart totally agreed and further suggested that a group of Parish 
    Councillors should arrange to meet with the youth to develop plans. Cllr Mrs 
    Chubb was pleased to learn that the group was well spread about through the 
    village. Cllr Caunce was, in his words “well impressed” with the 
    presentation. Cllr Jay was informed that a session worker would cost 
    approximately £8 per hour which he calculated would be about £1,000 a year. 
    The ladies would now go and prepare a “wish list” for the Parish Council to 
    consider. Cllr Stuart, on behalf of the assembled Parish Councillors, 
    sincerely thanked both Mary and Emily for the work they were accomplishing 
    with the youth of the village. The ladies then left the meeting.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the 28th November I attended a meeting of the South 
 Cotswolds Neighbourhood Area Police and Community Consultative meeting in the 
 Early Years Learning Centre, Watermoor, Cirencester. The meeting was ably 
 chaired by Mrs Vera Coulson a member of the Police Authority. She explained the 
 difficulties the force was experiencing in balancing its budget as this year 
 the reserve fund was used to make ends meet. Inspector Steve Williams gave a 
 facts and figures update to his crime statistics. Crime detection is currently 
 only 2% below the target and that should be met before the period expires at 
 the end of March 2008. He was pleased to report that the response time for 
 incidents was very high at 93%. Target times for urban areas was 10 minutes and 
 20 minutes for rural areas. A policing survey was distributed which aims to 
 categorise residents’ fears and police action taken. An open day has been 
 planned for Cirencester Police Station for Sunday 27th January. The public will 
 be given access to most of the Police Station and it is hoped to have the 
 helicopter land in the Forum car park. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 29th November I attended a meeting of the Chartered 
 Parishes group at the Westwood Centre in Northleach. Only three parish 
 representatives attended. Nevertheless it was an opportunity to network with 
 Gloucestershire Highways personnel. Chris Franklin, Area Stakeholder Manager 
 for our area confirmed that he had received the cctv survey of the culvert and 
 had passed it to a colleague for analysis. Other Highways officers present 
 included Jennifer Watkins and Martin Midgeley. Martin Bruton, GCC Trading 
 Standards gave a very interesting talk on how his department operated. The next 
 meeting will take place on Tuesday 5th February at a venue yet to be decided. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 4th December I attended a training day organised by 
 GAPTC at Hucclecote Parish Offices in Pineholt Village Hall. Over 30 clerks 
 attended the event which started at 10am and finished about 2.30pm. Titled 
 “Clerk’s Networking” the day began, after registration with an award ceremony 
 for those Clerks attaining qualifications in CiLCA, WWYC, Quality and 
 Publishing. Ivor Ward-Davies who used to work for local radio gave a talk on 
 how to deal with the press and ten tips on how to avoid being misunderstood. 
 After a buffet lunch networking continued. I enquired from the group on how 
 their different District Councils interacted on planning and was surprised to 
 learn from a clerk in the Stroud area that if 5 or more residents objected to 
 an application then it was automatically decided by the regulatory committee. I 
 have mentioned this to Cllr Bennett (CDC) but he did not think that CDC would 
 be implementing such a scheme. The attendees were then divided into six groups 
 to try and thrash out how GAPTC should go forward and what clerks and councils 
 needed from the organisation. Kim Bedford the new County Secretary will analyse 
 the feedback and report at the next meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During November, of the 22 available working days, I 
 averaged 3 hours 15 minutes per day which is slightly less than my contract 
 allows.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 10th DECEMBER
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>South Cerney Sewer Replacement Scheme</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart drew the attention of the Committee to Correspondence Item No.21 
 dealing with a letter from Customer Relations at Thames Water Utilities Ltd and 
 a note clarifying its content from Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP. Briefly it stated 
 that the reasons for the delay in negotiations with land owners had nearly been 
 resolved. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb would thank Gloucestershire Highways for the work carried out in 
 cleaning the ditch in Station Road. Cllr Stuart asked Cllr Mrs Chubb if 
 attention could be drawn to the potential blockages of the culvert entrances. 
 There are exposed pipes which transverse the ditch in front of culverts causing 
 debris to collect and cause obstruction to the water flow. The Clerk was asked 
 to enquire from Gloucestershire Highways if it could inspect the ditch and 
 advise what action could be taken to reposition the pipes which are causing the 
 obstruction. Cllr Harris informed the Committee that he had cleared debris from 
 the culvert grille that morning, i.e. Monday 12th December. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn Bank Reinstatement <br>
 </b>Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways was still awaiting a consent 
 license from the Environment Agency before work could proceed.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>360 Degree Swing</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the replacement wooden panel for the swing had been 
 installed and the apparatus was now serviceable. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b> <br>
 The Clerk confirmed that Betec had acknowledged its verbal quote of £450 plus 
 VAT to refurbish the notice board in Clarks Hay. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter Designs <br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Chubb would endeavour to provide estimates from suppliers of bus 
 shelters prior to the precept meeting scheduled for Wednesday 2nd January. The 
 Clerk was asked to enquire from Gloucestershire Highways where it would 
 consider the most appropriate location for a bus shelter in the vicinity of the 
 junction of The Lennards and Station Road and if it could suggest suitable 
 suppliers.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Flood Plan Template</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had spoken to John Beard from the Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue 
 service in Cirencester who informed him that the service was reactive. Cllr 
 Harris asked the Clerk to forward the generic plan to all Parish Councillors so 
 that they are aware of what information is required. The objectives are (a) to 
 identify the risks to the community and take action to mitigate them (b) 
 identify vulnerable people in the community and develop plans to assist/ 
 protect them (c) identify resources in the community available to assist during 
 an emergency (d) provide key contact details for the Emergency Management Team, 
 Key Community Resources, the Emergency services and Local Authorities. The 
 Parish Council agreed with Cllr Harris who requested that the item is discussed 
 at next month’s meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VAS Reliability</b> <br>
 The Committee was concerned at the reliability of the vehicle activated speed 
 signs. Currently the sign in Silver Street was being repaired but the one in 
 Station Road had also been unreliable. The Clerk was to enquire from 
 Gloucestershire Highways when the guarantee period ended and who would then be 
 responsible for the maintenance of the signs. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Permissive Path to rear of Kingfisher Place</b> <br>
 A positive response had been received from Aggregate Industries who wished to 
 meet with members of the Parish Council to discuss how best to take the project 
 forward. The Clerk was asked to copy the letter to Mary Grace, Cirencester 
 Access Group and Jenny Roberts asking if they had any ideas on how to overcome 
 the access problem, i.e. allowing wheel chair users while barring horses, 
 cyclists and motorcyclists from using the path. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ambulance Response Times</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that there had been two responses from residents both 
 critical at the length of time it took for an ambulance to call.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that all was in order and the seat had been repaired.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the platform of the 360 degree swing had been 
 replaced and the kit was back in action.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that generally the play equipment was in good order. Sand 
 on the Fenplay safety surfaces had “worked in” and most of the area is sound. 
 The contractors’ security fencing has been repositioned as agreed with no 
 complaint from users. The surface of the car park is becoming extremely bad and 
 it must be refurbished in the very near future. The Clerk was to ask Purvey, 
 Andrew Timbrell and Bison Plant Hire to quote for covering the surface with 
 20-50mm screened gravel with care being taken if a scrape was applied.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INTERRUPTION TO ELECTRIC SUPPLY</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart drew the attention of the Committee to a 
 continuing series of interruptions to the electricity supply in the western end 
 of the village. On one evening there had been 14 breaks in the supply lasting 
 anything from a couple of seconds to 10 minutes and occasionally for longer 
 periods. By his estimation there had been in excess of 30 power cuts in 10 
 days. Cllr Stuart had spoken to a Southern Electric engineer who admitted that 
 they were unsure of what was causing the disruption but investigations were 
 continuing. Cllr Stuart was disturbed that the problem was taking so long to 
 fix and described the situation as quite unacceptable, comparable to somewhere 
 in the third world. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>DOG BIN INSTALLATIONS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that the cost of supplying a dog bin 
 ranged from the basic model at £78.26 to a pedal operated version at nearly 
 £300 which would be more favourable in operation. Three sites had been 
 identified: (a) at the eastern end of the permissive path to the rear of 
 Kingfisher Place (b) at the entrance to Gypsy Lane (BSC 48) off Broadway Lane 
 and (c) at the entrance to the play area in Cerney Wick. The Clerk was to 
 repeat the request to CDC to move the bin at the entrance to the Upper Up car 
 park to the start of the gravelled path at the western edge of the car park 
 across the playing fields. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by 
 Cllr Jay that the Parish Council is minded to agree to purchase pedal operated 
 dog bins when the installation costs are known. The Clerk will enquire.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had met with Jim Sokol from the Environment 
 Agency to discuss the ditches between the disused railway line and Crane Farm. 
 Mr Sokol was powerless to insist that the ditches are dug out but advised that 
 the Parish Council should write to the landowners involved requesting that they 
 cleaned them out. The Committee agreed to recommend that the Parish Council 
 write such a letter.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris requested that Gloucestershire Highways be 
 asked to have a road sweeper operate through Bow Wow now that the leaves were 
 off the trees. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had attended a biodiversity 
 meeting at the Cotswold Water Park Society last week. The Committee agreed to 
 recommend that the Parish Council invites Dr Simon Pickering, CWP Society, to a 
 meeting to discuss how both parties might combine their activities. A meeting 
 had been arranged with Cllr Harris, Peter Jay in his capacity as South Cerney 
 Trust Chairman, Cllr Stuart and Dr Pickering for 18th December to familiarise 
 Dr Pickering with the different areas of the village and inspect them for 
 wildlife habitats. Cllr Stuart enthused that Dr Pickering will advise on how to 
 access part of the S.106 contribution from the Four Pillars development. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed that residents should ring 0845 7 70 
 80 90 to report a disruption to the electricity supply. Only by continually 
 reporting the outages will it become apparent to the Southern Electric that the 
 problem should be taken seriously. Otherwise letters to Tony Cooper, Swindon 
 Depot, Southern Electric, P.O. Box 65 Melksham CN12 7SY (telephone 01225 
 761500) would also help. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8:30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PETITION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee, made a plea to Parish Councillors to restrict themselves 
 to items of debate which referred only to the business of the Committee. He was 
 critical that Ambulance Responses and breakdown of Electrical Supply should 
 have been discussed in his Committee. Cllr Stuart was conscious that certain 
 items have nothing to do with the Committee but disagreed that interruption of 
 Electrical Supply was one of them. Nevertheless the point was understood and 
 items in future should only apply to the business of the committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 10th
 DECEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb had attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8:37pm.Cllr Mrs Land had apologised 
 for her absence as she was recovering from a recent illness.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas agreed to liaise with the Clerk to determine the revised 
 conditions of the borehole lease between the Parish Council and the Environment 
 Agency. The conditions of the current lease will expire on 18th December 2007. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay was confident that the Parish Council’s expenditure was within budget 
 with 66% used. The spread sheet indicated that spending was on target at this 
 point in the annual cycle. Overall, however, the Committee detected an 
 underspend on Village Plan projects and this could have repercussions on 
 precept planning. Cllr Jay asked that the Parish Council supports the idea that 
 underspent budget should not be carried forward when making allowance for 
 spending the following year. Cllr Nicholas disagreed stating that the budget 
 should be for projected expenses on specific projects only. It was accepted 
 that the matter would be discussed in detail at the Finance Committee’s precept 
 meeting on 2nd January. The Committee agreed to invite Cllr Caunce to the 
 Finance Committee’s deliberations on the precept when it met on 2nd January. 
 Cllr Caunce acknowledged that he would be available to attend. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Recommendation
 <br>
 </b>The Finance Committee had agreed to a recommendation from the PF&amp;VM 
 Committee to accept a quotation for £140 plus VAT from Arbor Tree Care to 
 remove the dead Hawthorn in Station Road. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and 
 seconded by Cllr Mrs Tunbridge that the Parish Council agrees to accept the 
 quotation. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 10th
 DECEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Nicholas opened the meeting at 9:10pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Land had sent an apology as she was recovering from a recent illness.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 The Clerk had demonstrated on a lap top computer how planning applications 
 received electronically would be handled. The obvious disadvantage was viewing 
 the information on a small screen but the scheme relied on members of the 
 Committee viewing the applications in their homes prior to the meeting. Cllr 
 Webb was concerned that with no hard copy residents wishing to view plans would 
 have to go to the District Council offices. The Clerk stated that during his 
 time in office which was nearly 10 years, not one resident, other than Parish 
 Councillors had ever made such a request to him to view an application. Other 
 members of the Parish Council had, however, been asked on occasions. Cllr 
 Nicholas requested Cllr Mrs Aram (CDC) to enquire from the district council how 
 these difficulties might be overcome.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay was indignant that person or persons unknown had 
 vandalised the public highway outside the Village Hall by painting white lines 
 on the roadway. Cllr Stuart had enquired from CDC if the newly appointed 
 Traffic Assistants would enforce the proclamation but was advised that the 
 markings were advisory and not statutory. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb announced that he will be attending a meeting of 
 the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd on Friday 14th December. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge asked the Clerk to remind Glebe 
 contractors that a reply was still awaited to the request for advice on how to 
 obviate the problem when contractors’ grass cuttings are left covering 
 gravestones in the cemetery particularly where plots are maintained by 
 relatives of the interred. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to remind South Cerney 
 Riding School in Cerney Wick of the need to clear the ditches opposite and 
 north of Bakers Farmhouse and also opposite the Crown public house to the 
 playing field. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart was involved in numerous activities since the 
 last meeting and reports of them follow: </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 27th November Cllr Stuart attended a SARA Problem 
 Solving Course organised by Glos Constabulary at HQ Quedgeley and run by 
 Christine Morrison of CMA training. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Main objective is for the police and all the community to 
 work in partnership in the reduction of crime.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Aim and objective of the course was to provide an 
 introduction to the problem solving processes used in crime reduction with the 
 intention that all present would be instructed to be able to understand how the 
 SARA system works and be able to apply that system in their own communities. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Community Partners present included two County 
 Councillors, two Mayors, a few town and parish councillors plus several PCSOs 
 from various parts of the county; three Stroud District Council Neighbourhood 
 Wardens plus Charles Kingsbury, Ian Kennedy and myself representing South 
 Cerney. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">SARA. This name represents the four stages of the system, 
 Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assess. Each stage has definite and tried 
 methods and formulas to follow and the entire system is cyclical. To attempt to 
 explain the system here would be impossible but it is sufficient to know that 
 it has to be used in all police cases and by all police personnel from s to the 
 very top. At the end of the day we divided into groups and applied the system 
 to an actual situation that had been experienced in Derby some month’s ago. It 
 was interesting to see that all of our groups used the method quite well and 
 that our “results and recommendations” were virtually the same as those of the 
 police and council in Derby. The works we recommended had all been applied and 
 monitoring of the results had shown distinct success. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">What next? I now await the next stage which I believe will 
 take the form of a local meeting with various people, organisations and 
 business representatives to attempt to set up a consultative group to use the 
 SARA system to reduce crime in the area. Exactly how and when that will take 
 place is anyone’s guess but I await the directions with great interest! I have 
 requested detail from our PCSOs but they have not been able to get back to me 
 in time for this meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 28th November Cllr Stuart attended a Biodiversity 
 Action Plan Consultation Workshop at the Cotswold Water Park Society. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were three such meetings that day with the two 
 previous being for Developers and Mineral Extractors. As only two Parish 
 Councils plus two District Councils were present plus Dr Simon Pickering and 
 Jill Bewley of the CWP, we had some good discussion. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Simon outlined the successes and failures they have had in 
 the past and their plans for the 2007-2016 period. He also explained that all 
 local councils are obliged to comply with the terms of the NERC Act 2006 
 regarding biodiversity in their areas. This is I believe a Europe wide scheme 
 to ensure that the environment is improved. This works well with the plans 
 already set out by the CWP and we can be involved in our parish. I suggested 
 that we have a meeting with Simon in the near future (Tuesday l8th Dec at 9.30) 
 to discuss what we can do and how we can apply to the 106 fund to finance 
 various works. I also suggested that Simon also comes to speak to this Council 
 before our January meeting and the Clerk has followed this with an official 
 invitation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 6th December Cllr Stuart attended an Airfield Liaison 
 meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I represented the Parish Council at this meeting which had 
 only four non military people in attendance. Cllr Clive Bennett CDC, Michael 
 Grace CDC Planning Enforcement Officer deputising for Ray Brassington who is on 
 compassionate leave due to a bereavement in his family and a member of Ampney 
 Crucis PC. Col Iain McEnd chaired the meeting and it went very quickly as there 
 was little to discuss. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">CDC have received only two or three complaints in the past 
 12 months and one of those could not be taken too seriously. RB had written to 
 the people who had complained in previous years to enquire if they had any new 
 complaints. It is understood that one of these replied that he had moved from 
 the village of South Cerney and was now no longer involved! It was emphasised 
 by Col McEnd that the flying of the noisy boxcar plane is not controlled by 29 
 Regt and they have no say in what flight path that machine takes. However, it 
 has been rarely used in the past year. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There is a change in the aircraft used. A smaller plane 
 than the previous one will be used and is based at the Army flying centre on 
 Salisbury Plain. It is owned by an ex-military man who is the chief pilot and 
 he uses mainly ex military or current military pilots who do the job for fun or 
 to log extra hours on their diary. The plane(s) are turbo and very much quieter 
 than the old piston jobs that caused so many complaints. It is likely that the 
 new plane will be housed at South Cerney to save on the cost of commuting and 
 will be used from Wednesday to Sunday evenings. Despite there being the 
 provision made at last year’s meeting for the end of flying to be extended to 
 7pm on Sundays, this has not been taken up in the past twelve months. It is 
 there in case they should be running late and need to get the final drop done 
 to complete that day’s programme.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The continuation of these meetings was questioned by 
 the civilians. Col McEnd stated that the Army wished them to be retained as 
 they provide a good conduit between the military and the community. Next 
 meeting is planned for Nov 08. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 11th December Cllr Stuart attended a meeting with 
 Severn Thames Canal personnel and South Cerney Parish Council Representatives. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At request from the Canal Trust a meeting was held at the 
 Village Hall on Tuesday 11 Dec at 10.30am. Present were three members of the 
 Trust including Bruce Hall who was until recently the overall chairman of that 
 organisation, Neville Holder a committee member plus Nigel Stoddart Kennedy a 
 member of the Stroud District Council and chair of the Trust’s Western 
 Footpaths committee. Representing South Cerney were Cllr James Harris and 
 myself. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The objective set out by the Trust was to set up a group 
 consisting of Parish Council members representing all the councils along the 
 line of the old canal from the Tunnel House to Inglesham. This will be to 
 increase support for the renovation of the Canal. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris stated that there would not be universal 
 support for the full renovation as many people would prefer to see the money 
 required spent on “more worth while projects”. The Trust agreed that was a 
 problem but one that they had been dealing with for many years. I suggested 
 that every council would want to see what benefit their parishes would see from 
 the canal and went on to emphasise that we wanted to see the tow path brought 
 up to a standard suitable for all users especially the section between the Old 
 Lock House and Siddington as that was part of our Village Plan. The Trust 
 members were totally in agreement with this and were going to contact GCC PROW 
 to see how things can be speeded up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">We suggested that many people use the footpaths along the 
 canal and to establish a route from the Severn to the Thames would attract many 
 more. The Trust are already working on this project and are in negotiations 
 with several landowners to establish a permissive path as there are no actual 
 public rights of way from Latton to Inglesham. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Trust asked if I would take on the task of setting up 
 the group of local councils but I declined as I am too involved with other 
 commitments but said that I and others from this village would no doubt be 
 prepared to be involved at the actual meetings. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 9:30pm.</p>
