 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 10th October 2007</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Land that the Minutes were a true and accurate record. Cllr Nicholas abstained 
 as he did not attend the meeting. The remainder of the Parish Council were all 
 in favour and Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No representative from the Youth Parish Council attended 
 the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas will track down a member to enquire about 
 the intentions of the group. The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from 
 Cllr Caunce that the YPC could be encouraged through participation in suitable 
 schemes such as to decorate the village for Christmas. Parish Councillors 
 thought that it was too late to get involved in providing decorations for the 
 coming festive period. Cllr Caunce persisted stating that there must be other 
 schemes which could be devised to reignite the interest of the group.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resurfacing Work</b> <br>
 Notification of plans to resurface Broadway Lane and Silver Street during 
 January 2008 had been received. Cllr Harris had enquired if it was possible to 
 install the sewer pipe before the resurfacing work but Cllr Stuart had been 
 informed that it was not due to technical reasons. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewerage Scheme Delays</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had met with Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP and was reassured that he 
 would try and motivate those involved to come to an agreement sooner rather 
 than later so that the works could proceed without too much delay. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Missing Agenda Item</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb criticised the Clerk for omitting to include an item on the agenda on 
 the cost of installing dog bins as agreed at the last meeting. The Clerk would 
 include the item in the December agenda.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the weekend of 26/27/28 October I attended the annual 
 Clerks’ Conference held this year at Kersley, near Coventry. I don’t intend to 
 read the full report which is included with the Minutes of the Committees’ 
 discussions which I delivered to all, earlier this afternoon. This is an 
 abbreviated version. As usual I found networking with other clerks an 
 invaluable experience gaining encouragement and tips. Of special interest was 
 notification that Section 137 will be enhanced by a new arrangement to be known 
 as the “Power of Well Being”. If a scheme can be shown to be in the interests 
 of the community and would otherwise have been capped by the provisions of 
 Section 137 then funding will be allowed without restriction. Section 137 
 currently allows the Parish Council to spend £5.64 per elector on schemes not 
 otherwise allowed for under the Local Government Act 1972. The long term aim 
 for local government is to remove a tier which will leave Parish/Town/Community 
 Councils and Unitary Authorities. Our neighbours in Wiltshire are already 
 changing to this new order but Gloucestershire has been reprieved for the 
 moment. It will eventually mean that the lesser entities will cluster either on 
 single issues or amalgamate under a dominant Town council. It seems that 
 capping based on the old order will continue with Town and Parish Councils 
 keeping their exemptions. The deadline for updating the Freedom of Information 
 published has been extended until December 2008. During the weekend I attended 
 various workshops including managing emails and minute taking.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During October, of the 16 available working days due to my 
 holiday and attending the conference, I averaged 3 hours 40 minutes per day 
 which is what my contract allows. I did not include attending the conference in 
 the calculations.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 12th NOVEMBER
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr Caunce had opened 
 the meeting at 7:00pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Walker was absent due to his continuing overseas detachment in Iraq. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VAS Station Road</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the vehicle activated sign in Station Road was not 
 operating correctly. The sign in Silver Street has missing lights in the outer 
 limit circle. The Clerk will report the incidents to George Surman at GCC. Cllr 
 Webb reported that the VAS in Broadway Lane had been removed. Cllr Caunce noted 
 that the one in Station Road was now working correctly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Compensatory Wish List <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart had been informed that the “wish list” had been forwarded to 
 Thames Water. He will attend a meeting on Wednesday 14th November with 
 representatives of Thames Water, their agents and contractors and our agents 
 Chris Graham and Stuart Milsom to discuss the list. Cllr Harris asked Cllr 
 Stuart to request that the contractors heavy roll the path to the rear of 
 Kingfisher Place adjacent to Lake 16. Cllr Stuart explained that the 
 discussions he will attend would focus on the “wish list” and work on the 
 permissive footpath would have to be raised at another venue. Cllr Harris had 
 ascertained that Aggregate Industries owned the path and the person to contact 
 was Mr Rob Werfell on 01934 745036. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce interrupted his report for Cllr Stuart to make 
 a statement on his meeting on 14th November, at Upper Up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">“Due to be present: Mr C. Graham, Mr S. Milsom (both Moore 
 Allen and Innocent, agents for the Parish Council), Spencer Coxon (Murphy) and 
 Cllr M. Stuart. Mr Coxon did not arrive and we rang to remind him of the 
 appointment only to find that he had forgotten and was in Cannock. His deputy 
 arrived several minutes later. Reinstatement of damaged grass etc. Considerable 
 damage has been caused by the movement of plant etc from the car park to the 
 work area and despite some efforts by the contractors to rectify the problems 
 it was agreed to await for the Spring before attempting to reseed that area. 
 Similarly, the surface above the newly laid pipes will not be in a suitable 
 condition for reseeding etc until Spring 2008. In the meantime, the Helas 
 fencing will be left in situ to prevent further problems. Although the section 
 of that fence that projects from the work area towards the car park will be 
 removed as it serves no purpose. The rutted section of land near to the 
 security fence and to the old hedge will need cultivating and reseeding next 
 year. At the far side and top side of the cycle mounds the contractors have 
 reformed the mound sides somewhat reducing their size but have made a pretty 
 good job. The work area is extremely muddy and again will take a long time to 
 drain and settle. We asked for the works to be extended just a little further 
 along the back of the mounds to permit our grass cutting contractors’ equipment 
 free and easy access. The two concrete inspection chamber tops have been 
 levelled and once top soil has been laid around them should cause no major 
 problems for our contractors. The contractor’s rep was reminded that it had 
 been agreed that when works had been finished that the footpath from our 
 playing field would be extended to the far north west corner of the field to 
 link up with the proposed new bridge. They were further reminded of the 
 undertaking they made to install a land drain to remove water from the western 
 end of the cricket field. We were asked what if any planting we required on the 
 mounds. MAI will prepare a specification of required works and send it to the 
 contractors. Murphy is not directly involved with the compensation issue and it 
 seems that Thames Water employee Laurence Adams does not understand the actual 
 demands of the Parish Council. He has stated that the Upper Up car park will be 
 reinstated using a suitable aggregate only and that bridge over the stream will 
 be constructed using a ‘flume’ with concrete bags as retaining walls which will 
 be rejected by the Environment Agency and therefore unacceptable to the Parish 
 Council.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart suggested to the Parish Council that he meets 
 with Mr Adams to thrash out the problems on a one-to-one basis. The Parish 
 Council was in agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce continued with his report. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire Highways confirmed by email that work for the 
 clearance of the ditch in Station Road had been ordered although no date was 
 forthcoming when this would be carried out. Cllr Harris reported that he had 
 cleared an accumulation of rubbish from the metal grille. The Committee then 
 discussed and agreed a quotation from Glebe Contractors for £45 plus VAT to 
 strim the ditch four times per season. It was agreed to add the cost of this 
 extra work to the precept demand. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways was awaiting a consent license from 
 the Environment Agency before work could proceed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>360 Degree Swing</b> <br>
 The replacement platform had been delivered. Securing brackets had been 
 ordered. Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to chase suppliers if these were not 
 delivered within two weeks.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Notice Board</b> <br>
 Three quotations had been received to refurbish the notice board. The most 
 competitive had been a verbal quote from Betec for £450 plus VAT which the 
 Committee recommended that the Finance Committee agree. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter Designs</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk had passed on advertising leaflets showing 
 various bus shelter designs to Cllr Mrs Chubb who agreed to enquire about costs 
 from the manufacturers. A letter (51) had been received objecting to the 
 erection of a bus shelter at the entrance to the Lennards.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that all was in order with the exception of the public 
 seat which needed two slats to be replaced. A quote from R.O.W. Berry for £60 
 was accepted and agreed under the provisions of the discretionary fund.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that generally the equipment was in good order. He would 
 continue to monitor the deterioration of the plastic elements of the Spinner. 
 The 360 degree swing was locked up awaiting parts although many local residents 
 noted how much quieter the area was without the swing in action.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that with the exception of the Cycle Mounds all equipment 
 was in order. The Cycle Mounds were still not usable due to the civil 
 engineering works. A meeting had been arranged for 10am on Wednesday 14th 
 November with our agents and Murphy to discuss reinstatement of damaged 
 surfaces on the playing fields. The seat had been “painted” blue and white by 
 vandals. There was a small amount of graffiti on the Senior Swing. The special 
 sand had been spread on the Fenplay safety surfaces although more will be 
 needed on the Activity Area next year. The Committee recommended that the 
 Finance Committee agrees to a payment of £20 to Mr E. Curtis for his assistance 
 in spreading the sand. The Clerk was asked to write to Mr Curtis expressing 
 thanks for his help, not only with the sand but also for his efforts in 
 collecting litter which was noted favourably by the Bledisloe inspection team. 
 A section of the timber fence which had fallen down had been replaced by 
 contractors.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PUBLIC SEATING SURVEY</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had carried out a detailed survey of the 
 public seating within the Parish and concluded that the seats were fit for 
 purpose with the exception of the one on the playing field in Cerney Wick. The 
 Clerk was to ask R.O.W. Berry to quote to replace two seating rails with the 
 best available material. Cllr Caunce reported a request from a resident in 
 Clarks Hay that the seat opposite the Chip Shop should be temporarily moved to 
 another location to prevent youths congregating in its vicinity. The Clerk 
 stated that the seat had been provided by Mr Berry with agreement from the 
 previous Parish Council and he should be consulted before any decision was 
 taken on its removal. Cllr Stuart agreed with Cllr Mrs Chubb who said that the 
 seat was well used by the elderly accessing local facilities and Cllr Nicholas 
 stated that it was a valuable community asset. The three Councillors were 
 opposed to the idea of moving the seat and Cllr Caunce accepted their arguments 
 in favour of leaving it in situ. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BLEDISLOE CUP REPORT 2007</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The inspection team graded South Cerney overall as “Highly 
 Commended” stating that the village is a mixed community that appears to “gel” 
 very well. It is led by an active Parish Council that is evidently not content 
 to sit on its hands. Routine work is attended to well and at the same time new 
 projects are coming forward thick and fast. This is an excellent entry. The 
 Clerk was asked to arrange for publication of the report on the web site, copy 
 to Cllr Stuart for display within the Village Hall and also to Glebe 
 Contractors who were praised for the high standard of maintenance to the verges 
 and playing fields. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TREES ON THE PIECE (Correspondence items 26/27/40)</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A report on the state of trees on the Piece by one of the 
 tree wardens was accepted by the Committee. The Chairman, Cllr Caunce 
 congratulated the author on its thoroughness. Cllr Nicholas stated that the 
 trees on the Piece improved the visual landscape value of the neighbourhood. 
 Cllr Stuart, Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb will re-inspect the area, especially the 
 northern bank and report their findings to the Parish Council meeting on 
 Wednesday. The Clerk was asked to await their report before forwarding the 
 supported opinion of the tree warden to Mrs Johnsen. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris gave a report on behalf of the inspection team 
 which recommended that householders in the vicinity of the Piece could pay for 
 tree work if it was their wish but the Parish Council would select the tree 
 surgeon and specify the work to be carried out. On the Evergreen Holm Oak only 
 very limited surgery would be permitted as identified by red and white hazard 
 tape attached to the limb to be cut. The Field Maple could be felled at ground 
 level. No surgery will be permitted on the Beech trees. If residents needed 
 clarification Cllr Harris would be happy to oblige. The Parish Council accepted 
 the deliberations of the inspection team. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to commend Watermark for its 
 reinstatement of the bank on Lake 16 near Kingfisher Place. The Committee 
 agreed with Cllr Harris who proposed that the path be made more user friendly 
 for disabled access. Cllr Stuart suggested that it was a job eminently suited 
 to the Work in the Community team but ownership must be established and consent 
 agreed before any action could be taken. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge complained that the ground maintenance 
 team left strimmed material on grave surrounds which necessitated extra work 
 for those individuals who maintained their plots. The Clerk was asked to 
 enquire if Glebe Contractors could devise a method to avoid this action. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the Football Club was 
 experiencing the need for the provision of a roadway and path to service the 
 new pavilion to comply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination 
 Act and Building Regulations. The Football Club had asked that the Parish 
 Council give approval for the work in principle. The Committee recommended that 
 the Parish Council agreed to its request. The Parish Council concurred. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had obtained a copy of the requirements for 
 tree risk assessment and passed it to the Tree Warden. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to inform the GCC PROW team 
 that the hand rail on the footbridge, south of Churn Pool in Cerney Wick had 
 been damaged. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8:25pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 12th
 NOVEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8:28pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Due to the absence of Cllr Jay from the Parish Council 
 meeting, Cllr Webb gave the report of the Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent his apology for absence as he was otherwise engaged. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread sheet analysis</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay had confidently declared that the Parish Council’s expenditure was 
 within budget with 58% used. The spread sheet was a useful tool in the 
 administration of the accounts. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Mini Audit report</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay had performed a mini audit of the accounts by carrying out a cross 
 check of entries in the ledger. All was in order. He also had analysed about 
 12.5% of the issued cheques following the trail from authorisation in the 
 Minutes through to the bank statement. Again, all was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Annual Precept meeting</b> <br>
 The Committee had agreed to meet on Wednesday 2nd January 2008 at 7.30pm at 6 
 The Lennards to discuss its recommendations for the forthcoming precept. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations of the Playing Field and Village 
 Maintenance Committee</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Field and Village Maintenance Committee had 
 recommended that the Finance Committee should approve a payment of £20 to Mr E. 
 Curtis for his work in spreading the sand on the safety surface at Upper Up 
 play area. The Finance Committee had concurred. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Field and Village Maintenance Committee also 
 recommended that the Finance Committee should approve the verbal quotation from 
 Betec to refurbish the notice board at Clarks Hay for £450 plus VAT. The 
 Finance Committee had agreed and asked the Clerk to insist that Betec sign a 
 copy of the authorisation as proof of acceptance which the Clerk had achieved.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROTECTION OF HISTORICAL STRUCTURES ON THE SEVERN &amp; 
 THAMES CANAL</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger (CDC) explained that he had been invited by 
 Mr Bruce Hall, past Chairman of the Canal Trust, to promote the protection of 
 historical structures on and under the line of the Severn &amp; Thames canal which 
 is “listed”. He further elucidated his involvement with the Trust and how he 
 had tried to create interest within CDC to support his mission. The CDC would 
 support the idea in principle only. Cllr Nicholas explained that the only 
 involvement the Parish Council had with the canal was for the provision of a 
 cycle path along its tow path. Interest in the canal was minimal as evidenced 
 by the lack of response made in the Village Plan survey. The Parish Council 
 agreed with his assumption that it would be happy to receive information but 
 loathe to be put on the spot to give support. Cllr Stuart added that it would 
 be a welcome feat to see the canal full of water and operational but that will 
 take an awful long time. Cllr Messenger (CDC) asked for support to install 
 footpath information signs in the vicinity of where the canal crosses local 
 highways. The Parish Council further agreed with Cllr Nicholas who would like 
 the view of the South Cerney Trust on the matter and advised Cllr Messenger to 
 contact it for its reaction to his proposal. The Parish Council agreed to 
 postpone any decision on whether or not to support the scheme for the 
 protection of historical structures until the Trust determines the issue.</p>

 water park is that it will be designated an Area Action Zone under one umbrella 
 of the participating authorities. Cllr Stuart requested information on the 
 outcome of a proposed survey of the culvert from the Old Police Station through 
 the High Street and Upper Up to the end of River Way. The Parish Council had 
 contributed £400 towards a partial survey but a full survey was needed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas was concerned with the incidences of slow 
 response by ambulances. The Parish Council agreed to his suggestion that 
 anecdotal evidence is requested from residents and collated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a graffiti artist had painted 
 the seat in Bow Wow. The recent grass cutting had left cuttings spread over the 
 train unit on the toddlers play area and the Clerk was asked to inform the 
 contractors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land reported that the bollards recently erected 
 in Berkeley Close were inappropriate as they were painted all black. The Clerk 
 would inform Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the Cotswold Play Partnership 
 expected an outcome to its bid for £250,000 by 10th December. Rosemary Lynn at 
 CDC had been quizzed on the bid for 55 minutes. This was the last meeting of 
 the group in this format. On 1st November Cllr Stuart attended a meeting of the 
 Safer Cotswolds group. Action will be taken to cut down on under age drinking. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CERNEY NEWS CONTRIBUTIONS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Request information from residents on ambulance response 
 times which should include both slow and fast delivery of the service. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Resurfacing of Broadway Lane and Silver Street. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PERSONNEL COMMITTEE ON THE CLERK’S 
 ASSESSMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to leave the room while the report was 
 made by Cllr Webb. <br>
 Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest as the Clerk was a client of his 
 firm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Having now received the much overdue 2007/2008 National 
 Salary Award for Local Council Clerks, the Personnel Committee recommended that 
 in recognition of the great respect it has for the work of the Clerk it 
 reiterates the decisions of the full Parish Council (May 2006 minutes p.2101) 
 and confirm that the current clerk’s salary should be in line with the 
 incremental structure set out in the above document. That is: Scale LC2 Range 
 (b) step 33 back dated to 1st April 2007 and Scale LC2 range (b) step 34 as 
 from 1st April 2008. The Casual Users car allowance of 55.8p per mile for the 
 first 8,500 miles. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that the Parish Council accepts the recommendations of the Personnel 
 Committee. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart closed the 
 meeting at 10:07pm.</p>
