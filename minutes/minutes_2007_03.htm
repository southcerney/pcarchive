Cllr Stuart, Chairman of the Parish Council, welcomed Laura Mills from GRCC who had
asked for the meeting to introduce the draft report on the South Cerney Housing Needs
Survey to Parish Councillors. Briefly, of the 1238 questionnaires distributed a total of 206
replies were received which represented a response rate of 16.6%. Cllr Nicholas
congratulated the document as he considered it to be very well put together and the
information was valuable as it was based on the experiences of real people. Ms Mills agreed
with Cllr Jay who requested that the comments be categorised. The Parish Councillors
agreed with an offer from Cllr Nicholas to edit the comments which would be discussed as
an agenda item at next month’s Parish Council meeting. Cllr Jay stated that it was a very
good report as did Cllr Stuart who concurred that it was an excellent survey. Cllr Stuart
thanked Ms Mills for her attendance and she left the meeting at 7.28pm.

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr 
 Mrs Chubb that the Minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. Cllr 
 Stuart abstained as he had not attended the meeting. The remainder of the 
 Parish Councillors were all in favour. Cllr Stuart then signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Dominic Brown gave this report. He stated that it was 
 planned to install a multi user’s games area (MUGA). Cllr Stuart, Cllr 
 Nicholas, Cllr Jay and the Clerk will liaise with the group over where the 
 equipment might be sited. YPC Brown reported that members of the group had 
 attended council tutoring with Clair Dowan at CDC to improve its 
 communications. The YPC was planning to hold a “Red Nose” cyclothon on static 
 exercise bikes over the Easter holidays and if plans were finalised before 
 Wednesday 21st it could be advertised in the Cerney News. Cllr Stuart asked 
 Dominic if he would enquire from Claire Dowan if senior school pupils including 
 members of the YPC could use their school bus passes on public transport out of 
 school hours if they wished to attend after school events.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PEDESTRIAN CROSSING AND OTHER HIGHWAY MATTERS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Pedestrian Crossing</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart welcomed Martin Midgeley from Gloucestershire 
 Highways to the meeting. His report which argued that a crossing at the 
 junction of Broadway Lane and High Street was not necessary had been widely 
 publicised throughout the village. Copies of the report had been placed on the 
 notice boards, delivered to interested parties and published on the web site. 
 Generally his reasoning was accepted although there was a lengthy discussion on 
 the differing priorities of Parish and County councils. It was argued that 
 whereas the Parish Council was acting on local knowledge to encourage safe use 
 of the road system, the County had to take account of the overall effectiveness 
 and cost of such schemes. Cllr Nicholas reported that a crossing patrol lady 
 had recently been appointed for morning duties although possibly she was 
 operating in the wrong place causing some pedestrians to take a detour to cross 
 the road. Cllr Harris stated that a patrol crossing person focused the 
 attention of both motorists and pedestrians on the crossing place. When 
 questioned on any planned change to the junction of Broadway Lane and High 
 Street, Mr Midgeley stated that it would be very expensive to change the layout 
 which was not justified. Changes to road systems were prioritised according to 
 a hot-spot list and only two incidents had been reported at the junction since 
 2002. Cllr Nicholas stated that he was not interested in reactive planning 
 which illustrated the differing priorities of Parish and County councils. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons (GCC) supported Mr Midgeley stating that 
 money was a scarce resource and all schemes must be prioritised. Traffic 
 accidents were very high on the list and Gloucestershire Highways was 
 particularly proactive in reducing accidents and maintaining road safety. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Preston Toll Bar Junction</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Regarding the junction at Preston Toll Bar, Mr Midgeley 
 explained that there are possible business residential developments in the near 
 future (next 5 to 10 yrs) for Cirencester (e.g. Kingshill South, Siddington 
 Farm) that may provide either direct highway improvements or significant s106 
 monies that may change the junction layout – but this is all dependant on 
 developers and planning permissions. Gloucestershire Highways is actively 
 working with the developers so that they know our aspirations for this 
 junction. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In the interim period it is proposed to install a VAS on 
 each A419 approach to the junction. The signs will light up when activated by 
 speeding traffic to show a “crossroads warning sign” and the message “SLOW 
 DOWN”. It is hoped to have these erected by the summer. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas noted that there was a sign for traffic 
 leaving South Cerney Road stating “traffic to front and right has priority” and 
 queried why was there not a sign for traffic in the middle of the junction 
 stating “you have priority over South Cerney Road traffic”. Mr Midgeley argued 
 that to erect a sign in the middle saying something along these lines could be 
 construed as confusing and perhaps negligent. “As soon as you tell traffic in 
 the middle they have priority, you take the chance that traffic in the middle 
 forgets that A419 traffic from Dobbies has ultimate priority. It is safer that 
 drivers in the middle make eye contact with drivers leaving South Cerney Road 
 and work it out for themselves rather than blindly obeying road signs.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Midgeley was also asked if traffic from South Cerney 
 Road be allowed to use the bus lay-by when it joins the A419 to head into 
 Cirencester. He replied: “that at the moment there is a giveway line and sign 
 at the end of South Cerney Road but if drivers ignore this and use the bus 
 lay-by as an acceleration lane there is little we can do without closing the 
 bus lay-by (by turning the lay-by to kerbs and grass verge). This has an 
 implication on how the bus will stop, a significant construction cost and to 
 some extent is not justified on safety grounds.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clarks Hay Crossing</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A discussion on the artist’s impression showing an 
 extension to the footpath into the carriageway outside the United Church 
 continued. It was argued by Parish Councillors that if the scheme was to work 
 safely motorists must be made aware of the potential hazard to traffic and 
 pedestrians. Mrs Jennifer Roberts complained that the white lines used to 
 delineate the footpath on either side of the road were being ignored by 
 inconsiderate drivers. The white lines were not obvious enough and needed to be 
 repainted. The Clerk would inform Dave Flagg, Signs &amp; Lines Technician at 
 Gloucestershire Highways. Mr Midgeley would ask for an engineers’ report on a 
 design for actuality of the Clarks Hay scheme. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart thanked Mr Midgeley for his attendance. Mr 
 Midgeley then left the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CLLR PARSONS’ (GCC) REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons informed the meeting that repairs to the road 
 surface of Ham Lane would be carried out in the near future after Thames Water 
 had completed its work. Repairs to Broadway Lane had been brought forward and 
 would be completed in this calendar year because of the deterioration of the 
 carriageway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons reported that he had a special project to 
 increase the benefits of the aggregate tax. He was concerned at the low level 
 at which the tax was being returned to local communities. He estimated that in 
 relation to tax collected the return was very small and he wanted this return 
 to increase. He explained that distribution was in the gift of central 
 government. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay enquired as to the entitlement for youth service 
 provision for village children. Cllr Parsons would investigate and report back.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire enquired if there was any County Council’s 
 grants available to repair damage to the churchyard caused by vandals. Cllr 
 Parsons (GCC) advised him to enquire from GRCC and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) 
 suggested that he contact the District Council.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no matters arising that had not been dealt with 
 by the committees.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Nomination papers for prospective candidates in the 
 forthcoming election were distributed to 8 members of the Parish Council and 6 
 others who had requested them. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During February, of the 20 available working days, I 
 averaged 4 hours per day which is more than my contract allows.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 12th March. Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Squire and Cllr Stuart had attended the Monday 
 meeting. Cllr Squire had opened the meeting at 7.10pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had sent his apology for absence as he was celebrating one of his 
 children’s twelfth birthday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Matters Arising from previous Minutes </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Past Chairman’s Tree</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb had noted that reference had been made in the Minutes to Tom 
 Parker. This was incorrect and should be corrected to read Jim Parker. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Hedge in Bow Wow</b> <br>
 <b>Advertising “A” Boards</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire had reported that only the cutting back of the overgrowing hedge in 
 Bow Wow remained outstanding. Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire Highways was 
 aware. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Manhole Cover <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris reported that the manhole cover outside “Content” in Station 
 Road had not yet been repaired. Cllr Stuart reported that the manhole cover 
 outside Londis had not yet been repaired. The Clerk will remind Gillian 
 Portlock. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Bushes on Robert Franklin Way play area</b>
 <br>
 Cllr Squire had a meeting with R. F. J. Lobley BEM and totally agreed that the 
 bushes overgrowing from the play area should be cut back. <br>
 Since Monday, Cllr Harris had inspected the area and now quoted £175 plus VAT 
 to carry out the work. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris then declared a prejudicial interest as a 
 potential contractor and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">At full council it was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded 
 by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the Parish Council accepts the quotation from James 
 Harris Contracting. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter Graffiti</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had arranged with Steve Hanson, Payback in the Community team 
 supervisor for his team to paint out the graffiti in the bus shelter. Cllr 
 Stuart would supply the paint.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fire Hydrant Sign <br>
 </b>Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the fire hydrant sign outside Boxbush Farm had 
 been replaced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Stop Sign</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay complained that the bus stop sign at the bus shelter had not yet been 
 repaired. The Clerk assured him that all services who might be responsible had 
 been contacted.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that Cerney Wick residents had pruned the pyracanthus 
 hedge on the northern side of the play area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the play equipment was in order although soil was 
 required in the goal post area. Concrete rubble needed to be cleared off grass 
 and from in front of the fence outside Ash Moon before top soil is laid on the 
 old tower slide site.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the play equipment was in good order and several 
 youngsters had been seen working on the cycle mound jumps during the previous 
 weekend. Five rails of the recently renewed fence by the car park had been 
 vandalised. The Police had been notified that a reliable witness could identify 
 the culprits and was prepared to give evidence. Graffiti, similar to that which 
 appeared in the bus shelter, had been painted on to the cricket pavilion. A 
 window in the building had also been smashed. <br>
 Cllr Stuart updated the Parish Council on a message from Inspector Williams 
 which stated that evidence was being collated and action will be taken against 
 those persons responsible. Cllr Stuart continued his report stating that a 
 Salvation Army clothing/textile recycling bin had been installed on the car 
 park. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a potential 
 contractor and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard that the Parish Council agreed that James Harris Contracting is 
 requested to carry out urgent repairs to the fence at his normal daily rate. 
 The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 items as a potential contractor and left the room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Quotations for the repair of the stone posts and chain 
 surrounding the War Memorial had been received. After scrutiny the Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee accepted the cheaper quote from James 
 Harris Contracting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard that the Parish Council accepted the lower quote from James Harris 
 Contracting for £45 plus VAT. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Quotations based on the tender document for tree 
 maintenance throughout the village had been received. After scrutiny the 
 Committee recommended that the Finance Committee accepted the cheaper quote 
 from James Harris Contracting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard that the Parish Council accepted the lower quote from James Harris 
 Contracting for £335 plus VAT. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A storm damaged Lime tree in Silver Street needed to be 
 removed. James Harris Contracting had provided a verbal quotation for £75 plus 
 VAT which was accepted by the Committee. The cost was within its budgetary 
 allotment. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the Committee Room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform the Enforcement 
 Officer, CDC that advertisements were still appearing appended to the chain 
 link fence and free standing at the junction of Station Road and B4696 Spine 
 Road. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported at the Parish Council meeting that 
 the signs had been removed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform Roger Sollis CDC 
 that two contractors’ boards had been dumped at the northern access to Robert 
 Franklin Way play area near to the dog bin. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported at the Parish Council meeting that he 
 had removed the boards. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris was concerned that a permissive right of way 
 at the end of Ham Lane had been gated to prevent access. Numerous residents 
 were prepared to state that the path had been in use for many years as a walk. 
 The Clerk had contacted Sarah Burge at GCC PROW for forms to start proceedings 
 to create an official right of way. Cllr Squire volunteered to coordinate the 
 application. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that a fence was needed on the north 
 side of Robert Franklin Way play area upstream of the river Churn bridge to 
 protect children from falling down the bank and possibly entering the river. 
 The Clerk will inform the Water Park of the potential danger. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that Mr T. Groves, Ash Moon had 
 complained that vandals had used infill from the redundant tower slide site to 
 bombard his fence. Mr Groves verbally threatened to take legal action against 
 the Parish Council and its officers if it did not repair the damage. Cllr 
 Harris informed the Committee that a series of events outside of the Parish 
 Council’s control had delayed the filling in of the hole with top soil. The 
 Clerk advised that the Parish Council was not responsible for the damage caused 
 and Mr Groves must make any repair to his fence as he sees fit. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A discussion by the Parish Council followed. Cllr Jay 
 agreed that the Parish Council was not liable. Cllr Nicholas concurred but if 
 the Parish Council agreed to replace the damaged fence it would not create a 
 precedent. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that 
 the Parish Council replaces Mr Groves’ damaged fence panel. After a vote there 
 were 3 Parish Councillors in favour and 5 against. One Parish Councillor 
 abstained. The motion was therefore defeated. The Clerk will inform Mr Groves 
 of the decision of the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had been informed by Mike Barton GCC PROW that 
 the footbridge on the canal tow path bridging the river Churn had been 
 completed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had attended a conference on 
 the future of the Cotswold Water Park on Friday 2nd March at the Millennium 
 Building, Keynes Country Park. The long awaited implementation of a Master Plan 
 for the Cotswold Water Park was now at last under way. The Master Plan is an 
 all-embracing document, one that takes into consideration just about every 
 possible aspect of the area in question. As it is effectively destined to 
 become the roadmap for the future, it was felt that it was of vital importance 
 that key players, should be given the opportunity to meet the Master Planners, 
 Scott-Wilson to enable the contributors to put their views forward. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire enquired, on behalf of the Parochial Church 
 Council, if the Committee had any objection to a temporary cross being erected 
 over the Easter period on the Old Cross Memorial site at the junction of Clarks 
 Hay, Station Road and High Street. The Committee had no objection and the 
 Parish Council agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had enquired if the maintenance of trees 
 within the curtilage of the churchyard was the responsibility of the Parish 
 Council. The Clerk had received the following advice from Richard Bellis, GAPTC. 
 “If the churchyard has not been formally closed by an Order in Privy Council 
 i.e. it still has capacity for graves and is used for burials, the Parish 
 Council is not responsible for any maintenance in the churchyard. The 
 churchyard is in the ownership of the PCC who, as landowner, is responsible for 
 anything relating to the land whether burials, maintenance or whatever. 
 However, the Parish Council can contribute to the maintenance of the churchyard 
 using Section 214(6) of the Local Government Act 1972. The benefit of this is 
 that the responsibility for the churchyard and its condition still remains with 
 the PCC but the Parish Council can demonstrate that it values the facility and 
 the environment of the churchyard. I would recommend however that the Parish 
 Council only gives funding to the PCC as the PCC is responsible for the health 
 and safety of the users of the churchyard and any work activities in it. Thus 
 it will be responsible for ensuring there is adequate public liability 
 insurance, that any contractors are approved by it and work in accordance with 
 the instructions laid down by the PCC and any insurance claim would be against 
 the PCC and not the Parish Council. For this reason I would also suggest the 
 Parish Council provides funds direct to the PCC for the grass cutting rather 
 than letting the contract itself as this means that the contractor is employed 
 by the PCC again for health and safety/ insurance purposes.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to inform Lady Fanshawe that the Lime 
 tree in the triangle bounded by the bowling green, churchyard and the entrance 
 to Chapter Manor was apparently unstable and could be in danger of falling 
 over. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Squire had closed the 
 meeting at 8:18pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reported on the discussions of the Finance 
 Committee which had met on 12th March. Cllr Jay, Cllr Squire and Cllr Webb had 
 attended the Monday meeting. Cllr Jay had opened the meeting at 8.25pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Smith had sent his apology for absence due to work commitments.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising <br>
 </b>The Committee agreed to a proposal by Cllr Jay that an item be published in 
 Cerney News to inform village organisations that they could apply to the Parish 
 Council for grant funding not exceeding £500 if the project involved is 
 supported through its inclusion in the Village Plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After discussion on the sum to be made available, an 
 amendment was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that 
 no limit be imposed on the amount of grant available. There were 4 Parish 
 Councillors in favour and 4 against. The Chairman used his casting vote in 
 favour and the motion was carried. It was then proposed by Cllr Jay and 
 seconded by Cllr Webb that an item explaining the availability of grant funding 
 and the amendment be published in the Cerney News. The Parish Council was all 
 in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spreadsheet</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay considered that the Finance Committee and its Chairman be 
 congratulated on the prudent budgetary control which had been exercised over 
 the last 11 months. The spreadsheet was a useful device in monitoring on-going 
 expenditure.</p>
