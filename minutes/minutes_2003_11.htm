    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    Signs at Spine Road/Station Road<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that all but one of the signs had been removed.<br>
    Cllr Stuart thanked the members of the Parish Council for the support they had given him
    on his handling of the controversial subject of aircraft noise. He especially thanked Cllr
    Nicholas who was instrumental in articulating the response of the Parish Council.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    On Wednesday 15 October I arranged a meeting with Mr O'Connor (Redcliffe Homes), Mr
    Jenkins (Watermark), Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Parsons (GCC) and Mr Corke (Kingfisher Place
    resident) for Thursday 13 November at 7pm to discuss the adoption of Kingfisher Place. I
    also arranged that Cllr Jay attend a meeting in the Village Hall with Cllr Parsons (GCC),
    Mr Whittaker and Mr Summerell (both GCC Highways) on Monday 20 October at 3pm to discuss a
    plan for the proposed zebra crossing and other associated work. I attended the AGM of the
    SLCC in Stratford upon Avon on 18, 19 and 20 October. I was present at all sessions at the
    conference and was intrigued with the presentation from Sir Anthony Holland on the
    workings of the Standards Board. Notably of the 4,500 complaints received to date
    approximately only one-third had been referred for investigation. Francis Drake a Society
    Human Resources Advisor highlighted problems a Clerk might encounter in the workplace in
    dealing with Councillors and the various Acts of Parliament that regulated the
    arrangement. Insurance and its assessment were discussed thoroughly on the Sunday morning
    with great emphasis being attributed to risk assessments and the necessity of upgrading
    insured sums annually. The Rt. Hon Alun Michael MP, Minister for Rural Affairs and Local
    Environment Quality gave the keynote speech on Monday mainly concentrating on his pet
    theme of Quality Councils. Overall I enjoyed the occasion and my interaction with other
    Clerks. Once again I was lucky enough to win a bottle of champagne in a draw.<br>
    On Tuesday 21 October I was interviewed by Radio Gloucestershire and asked to describe the
    position of the Parish Council regarding aircraft noise in the village. I pointed out to
    the reporter that the matter had been discussed at length on more than one occasion and a
    presentation from objectors debated at the Annual Meeting in May. The Parish Council was
    mindful of the complaints but was pleased with the close liaison it had with the Army and
    the parachutists.<br>
    On 5 November I attended a Members Site Visit at Shorncote with Cllr Webb and listened to
    the proposed enlargement of the quarry for gravel extraction at Dryleaze Farm. I felt that
    the GCC Planning Committee was minded to grant extraction rights to Hills albeit with
    Conditions attached regarding the reinstatement when work finished. It was envisaged that
    a rolling reinstatement would take place over the course of extraction that was expected
    to start in 2004/5 and last until 2010/11.<br>
    During October, not including the three days spent at the Conference, I logged 73.25
    hours, which averaged 3 hours 20 minutes per available working day.<br>
    The Clerk was asked to include the time he spent at the Conference when he makes his next
    report.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields
    Committee that had met on 10 November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HGV Signs on Spine Road</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart complained that it was obvious from the number of heavy vehicles using Station
    Road from the Spine Road that the direction sign posts were not working satisfactorily.
    Cllr Stuart was particularly concerned that the sign before Lake 11 on the Spine Road was
    obscured by over growing bushes and needed to be cut back. He asked the Clerk to inform
    GCC Highways.<br>
    <strong>Ladder Bars</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris confirmed that the ladder rungs on the activity area had been replaced.<br>
    <strong>Cherry Tree, Clarks Hay</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris volunteered to remove the broken branch on the cherry tree in Clarks Hay.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way play area</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire confirmed that the pyracantha hedge on the Robert Franklin Way play area had
    been pruned.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Garages</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that rubbish dumped beyond the entrance to the garages at the end of
    River Way had not been removed. The Clerk would again inform CDC Environmental Health
    department.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the safety tiles needed to be pushed together. Cllr Harris, Cllr
    Squire and Cllr Stuart agreed to arrange to meet at the playing field to attempt to mend
    the joints. The top rail of the Junior Swing had not yet been replaced. The rungs on the
    activity area had been renewed. There were still some stones on the cycle mounds although
    many had been removed and pushed into the hedge. Cllr Stuart reported that water was
    standing on the lower surfaces of the mound. Mr Curtis had removed rubbish in the vicinity
    of the tennis court pavilion. The grass-seeded areas were much better due to the recent
    rain.<br>
    <strong>Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that she continued to sweep the leaves from the safety tiles.
    The &quot;No Dogs Allowed&quot; sign has been removed from the gate.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the swing and slide were in serviceable condition. The old goal
    mouth in the football area was now levelled and seeded. He noticed that there were eight
    patches of turf removed randomly each approx 6&quot; x 6&quot; x 1&quot; deep on the
    playing field. This, he considered was a health and safety hazard and therefore most be
    rectified immediately to avoid injuries. Many of the holes were now hidden and filled with
    autumn leaves. Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire volunteered to repair the damaged
    areas in the near future.<br>
    The Clerk was to enquire from GRCC if he could be given authority by the Parish Council to
    hire preferred contractors to carry out urgent jobs between Parish Council meetings and if
    so how such a resolution might be worded.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Tree Survey</strong><br>
    <strong>Silver Street</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire and Cllr Harris had inspected the condition of the trees in Silver Street on
    Tuesday and reported that only two trees needed attention.<br>
    <strong>The Piece</strong><br>
    Trees on the western end of the northern bank on the Piece needed to be cut back. Cllr
    Harris had provided a specification and price for the associated and outstanding work from
    the tree survey. Other contractors will be asked to quote.<br>
    <strong>Garage area, Upper Up</strong><br>
    From an inspection in January 2003 the specification for the work required at the Upper Up
    garage block is as follows: Remove all sycamore, cherry and undergrowth, trim back thorn
    to improve shape; plant twelve (12) red-stemmed Dogwood (container grown).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CHURCHYARD WALL EXTENSION</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that before planning permission for the churchyard wall extension is
    considered it will be necessary to commission an archaeological survey of the site. There
    was a further complication regarding the resiting of the proposed extension from the CDC
    Planning Office which suggested that the wall should not be demolished. Cllr Squire, as
    Churchwarden, argued that the wall should be taken down and rebuilt along the new line
    incorporating all the original stone and then adding new stone to make up the required
    length.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PLANTING</strong><br>
    After consulting with Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart informed Whitton Associates to suspend the
    tender process for the planting scheme at Upper Up until the Parish Council discussed the
    situation and its implications. It would be necessary to prepare a plan of what was
    affordable and/or useful and a long-term timetable would be required before such a scheme
    could be agreed. Cllr Nicholas recalled that it had been originally decided to have a
    2-phase plan. The groundwork as a first stage and the planting as stage 2. It had been
    suggested that members in the community might be encouraged to pay for the planting of
    memorial trees as a token of remembrance. The Committee agreed to hold a separate meeting
    to discuss a revised plan that would probably be implemented over a 3-year period.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>COUNCILLORS REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Verge Parking in High Street</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart asked the Clerk to notify the owners of the white Ford Fiesta XR2 to stop
    parking on the grass verge by Thrift Cottage in High Street and another vehicle,
    presumably owned by an occupant of Ryedale in Clarks Hay, was being regularly parked on
    the grass verge outside of that dwelling.<br>
    <strong>Barrier Repair</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris requested that the Clerk contact the Cotswold Water Park to report that the
    barrier where the river Churn passed under the disused railway line is broken.<br>
    <strong>Ground Maintenance along disused railway line</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris also requested that the Cotswold Water Park be asked to cut back the scrub
    along the railway line from Silver Street to the badger set.<br>
    <strong>VAT on Lawn Mower</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on a query posed by Mr John Hunt from the South Cerney Cricket Club
    if the Parish Council would be prepared to claim the VAT on the purchase of a new lawn
    mower. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Jay, Chairman of the Finance Committee, who
    advised against such action.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CORRESPONDENCE</strong><br>
    <strong>Treework</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that there had been no objections to any of the impending tree work
    as notified by Cotswold District Council.<br>
    <strong>Macventure Play Co Quotation</strong><br>
    The Committee recommended that the quote from Macventure Play to replace the cross over
    beams on the swings be accepted for Upper Up play area.<br>
    <strong>Ham Lane Ownership</strong><br>
    In reply to a query on the ownership of Ham Lane and its associated hedges the Principal
    Property Information Officer at GCC confirmed that land that is used as a path in Ham Lane
    was not owned by the County Council and neither was it a public right of way. Land
    Registry had previously informed Cllr Nicholas that the land was not registered. Cllr
    Nicholas volunteered to make another enquiry to see if the situation had been updated.<br>
    Cllr Caunce joined the meeting at 8.25pm.<br>
    <strong>Footpath Refurbishment</strong><br>
    GCC agents Halcrow provided plans to resurface sections of footway in Robert Franklin Way
    and Berkeley Close. Work is planned to start on 19 November and last for about two and a
    half weeks.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way Play Area Grant</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that the grant application to refurbish play equipment at Robert
    Franklin way play area had been recommended for executive agreement by the Committee at
    CDC.<br>
    <strong>Village Hall Disabled Parking</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a letter he had received from Mary Grace, Secretary to the
    Cirencester Access Group about the provision of disabled parking in the vicinity of the
    Village Hall. As the roadway is the property of GCC Highways the decision was outwith the
    gift of the Village Hall Committee. With the severe competition for parking and the number
    of disabled people using the hall and arriving in vehicles inevitably there would be those
    who would be disappointed in not being able to park outside it. In the circumstances it
    would be unfair to promote a designated disabled parking area. Cllr Jay remarked that if
    vehicles respected the Keep Clear area in front of the hall that space could be properly
    used as a pick up/set down point. Cllr Stuart volunteered to meet with Mrs Doris Land who
    is Chairman of the Cirencester Access Group to discuss the matter with her.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>IMPACT SCHEME</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on a meeting he had with Cllr Parsons (GCC) and personnel from GCC
    Highways including John Whittaker, Martyn Summerell and Paula Postlethwaite on 20 October
    to discuss the impact scheme now in progress. Cllr Jay noted that this was the first time
    a set of plans had been made available and he welcomed this development. The plan was to
    resurface the carriageway from the Royal Oak public house to Greystones during the mid
    term school break but unfortunately this deadline had been missed. Other associated work
    that included new drop kerbs and the resurfacing of some footpaths was continuing. Plans
    to provide a zebra crossing in this phase had been put on hold, as legal notification was
    necessary before such an installation could take place. Cllr Jay informed the meeting that
    the Parish Council was in favour of such a scheme. The Clerk was to ask Mr John Whittaker,
    Area Traffic Manager to supply a copy of the technical criteria of a zebra crossing and to
    suggest a selection of three possible sites for its construction. The Clerk was also to
    thank the Highways team for the very useful information made available at the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee, which had met on 10

    Cllr Jay inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for October. It was proposed by
    Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council agrees to make the above
    payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    James Harris Contracting Activity unit repair Upper Up; supply pea grit £189.00<br>
    James Harris Contracting Remainder grass seeding plus first cut at Upper Up £575.00
    £764.00<br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as the supplier and withdrew from the debate.
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Webb that the rest of the Parish
    Council agrees to make the above payments. The Parish Council was in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ledger Check</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay had carried out a check of the payments made in and out so far in this financial
    year through the current account, deposit account statements and cheque book entries. He
    said that to the best of his ability everything was in order and thanked the Clerk for his
    diligence.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village Plan &amp; Budget 2004-2005</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay invited suggestions from the assembled Councillors on budget proposals.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard would like to see the purchase of speed activated warning signs at the
    village gateways. Cllr Jay said that provision for the signs and other schemes, which
    might include a zebra crossing could be made as part of the Parish Council's contribution
    to road safety.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas remarked that it should be a Parish Council objective over the remaining
    four year period to update further play equipment in the village. Cllr Stuart recommended
    that a skateboard ramp be provided at Upper Up park. A football kick back wall would also
    be welcomed, as would youth shelters. A pop-in facility which might include a cyber café
    and a youth centre could also be considered as a long-term objective.<br>
    Cllr Jay suggested the provision of a subsidised evening bus service for the youth of the
    village to Cirencester.<br>
    Cllr Jay and Cllr Mrs Pollard, on a recent trip to France, were impressed with raised
    flower beds they noticed in a small village which might be useful to decorate the grass
    verges of the village.<br>
    Cllr Smith suggested that the street furniture should be of a uniform design while Cllr
    Jay remarked that more rubbish bins be installed adjacent to public seating.<br>
    The Clerk reported that just one response had been received from the appeal for
    constructive budget spending made in the Cerney News. A request from Alison Crawford,
    Chairperson, South Cerney Players that a grant in the region of £1,320 is considered to
    provide additional staging had been made. Cllr Jay informed the Committee that the Village
    Hall heating boiler recently had to be replaced at a cost of some £4,000 and consequently
    its funds were now nearly exhausted. He continued that to provide a modicum of comfort for
    spectators eighty new chairs at an estimated cost of £30 each were required for the hall
    area.<br>
    Overall Parish Councillors agreed that many of the proposals could be budgeted for over
    the remaining three financial years of the Council. The Committee agreed that it should
    meet after the December meeting to decide on its budget proposals that would be presented
    for approval to the Parish Council at its January meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Other Correspondence</strong><br>
    Three requests for donations had been received and added to the list for determination in
    March 2004. The Centralised Attachment of Earnings Payment System (CAPS) had explained its
    procedure and the first payment had been received.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Quotation</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the quotation from Macventure Play Co to replace the two swing beams at a
    cost of £265.10 ex VAT. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee, which had met on 10
    November.<br>

    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>CT.2648/1/Z Residence at Lake 10, Cerney Wick Lane</strong><br>
    Mr C. Davis (Enforcement Officer, CDC) stated that having a member of the owner's family
