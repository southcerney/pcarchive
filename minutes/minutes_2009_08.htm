    <p align="justify">Prior to the Parish Council meeting Parish Councillors 
    had a meeting with Kate Darch GRCC Village Agent Project Manager and Sue 
    Black a Village Agent serving nearby communities. Kate showed a 12 minute 
    long DVD which explained the purpose and work of a Village Agent. The 
    primary purpose of the scheme was to help elderly residents to connect with 
    the various services available to them and provide the back up to allow them 
    to live with as much independence as possible in their own homes. The 
    service was funded by the County Council and the Primary Care Trust and was 
    secure for the foreseeable future. Village Agents it was emphasised were 
    autonomous. Sue Black is employed for 20 hours a week serving two village 
    clusters although generally most Village Agents did half that amount. Sue 
    was setting up meetings with Joan Townsend, Reta-May Matthews and the COSY 
    Club to promote her message in South Cerney. Sue will distribute flyers in 
    the community promoting the meeting which she hoped would take place in 
    October. Cllr Stuart stated that the Parish Council works well with GRCC and 
    would support the concept. He thanked both ladies for their presentation.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 10th AUGUST 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Kimberley, Cllr 
 Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris had sent an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Crime Prevention.<br>
 </b>Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr Stuart for all his work in liaising with the 
 police and dealing with Thames Water issues. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on the Police Neighbourhood Panel 
 meeting which was held on 6th August in the Village Hall. It was well attended 
 by people from both South Cerney and Siddington. These meetings are held every 
 three months with the objective of Police and Communities working together to 
 reduce crime and anti-social behaviour in the area. At the previous meeting it 
 was asked that attempts were made to reduce the problems with motorists parking 
 on pavements and on drop kerbs, especially near the Post office and by Londis. 
 Since then some six warning notices have been served on offending motorists and 
 none of these have been seen to have re-offended. Over the next period the 
 objective is to deal with the problem with a group of anti-social young people 
 who are creating excessive noise late at night in the play area at Robert 
 Franklin Way. Cllr Stuart would like to encourage anyone living in that area to 
 call the police whenever there is such an incident.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Youth Shelter at Upper Up.</b> Cllr Stuart reported 
 that there had been no further contact with the contractor. He recommended that 
 the outstanding payment should continue to be withheld. The Parish Council was 
 in full agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Aggregate Industries Contact.</b> Cllr Stuart reported 
 difficulty in making contact with the surveyor from Aggregate Industries. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelter in Station Road.</b> Cllr Mrs Chubb 
 reported that one of the opaque panels had been disfigured with graffiti. Cllr 
 Caunce had contacted Paul Swift at Gloucestershire Highways and reminded him of 
 his commitment to construct a pathway from the shelter to the highway. Mr Swift 
 confirmed his awareness. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Shorncote Link</b> Cllr Stuart reported that the work 
 to shore up the entry to Upper Up playing fields from the Cirencester to Ashton 
 Keynes road had been completed. Other work on the Upper Up playing field path 
 was awaited. Despite previous meetings at which agreement had been reached with 
 Thames Water and its agent Bruton Knowles on action to complete their 
 commitment Richard Maggs (Thames Water) had suggested yet another meeting. 
 There was every possibility that Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP would also attend if 
 such a meeting was agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was instructed to inform Thames Water that 
 despite its assurances of action within 14 days from its letter of 9th July, 
 none had been forthcoming. The Clerk was to express the disappointment and 
 frustration of the Parish Council and state that action would now be taken at 
 the next level.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow.</b> Although Cllr Harris 
 had requested that the Clerk write again to Lady Fanshawe after this meeting in 
 August to remind her that the evergreen hedge and other branches on the north 
 side of Bow Wow, between Lower Mill and the bridge over the river Churn, needed 
 to be cut back as it was overgrowing the carriageway Cllr Stuart had spoken 
 with Lady Fanshawe regarding other matters and in the circumstances it was 
 agreed not to write to her again in the near future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Drop Kerbs.</b> Cllr Stuart reported on a meeting Cllr 
 Mrs Land had with Paul Swift (Gloucestershire Highways) on the installation of 
 drop kerbs at points in the village. Three sites had been identified and work 
 would start on one in Clarks Hay shortly. The other two would, when finance 
 permitted, be installed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recycling Bins at Upper Up.</b> Cllr Stuart was very 
 impressed with the outcome of the meeting he had with Roger Sollis (CDC) 
 regarding the collection of material left inconsiderately in the vicinity of 
 the recycling bins. To date, he reported, the contractor had performed 
 extremely well in keeping the site tidy. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dog Fouling at Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he had found no evidence of dog fouling on the play 
 area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb reported that a small piece of wood had been scored out of the base of 
 the second carriage. There was some litter, mostly empty cigarette packets and 
 cigarette butts. The willow tree still needs attention.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play equipment was all in order. There was a tree 
 in the hedge on the right as you enter the play area which needed its crown 
 raising to give better visibility.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the play equipment was in good order. The Fenplay 
 safety surface needed the special sand to be reapplied before the end of the 
 summer period. The basketball post had been removed. The base of the youth 
 shelter continued to show signs of cracking at the joints of the redundant 
 holes. There was some slight graffiti on the shelter. Thames Water have still 
 to finish the path and drainage work. Moles in the area are an increasing 
 problem although a trap had been obtained and John Hunt is hopeful of success 
 in catching the rodents.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>WHEELED ACCESS FROM THE CAR PARK AND THE ENTRANCE BY 
 THE LANGET TO THE PLAY EQUIPMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had been in contact with Netlon a company that 
 supplied a product called Turfguard which he considered a suitable material to 
 construct a pathway across the grassed areas to the play equipment. Adrian 
 Gibbs the ground maintenance contractor suggested that the path be laid after 
 the end of the cutting season. Cllr Stuart will liaise with Cllr Kimberley on a 
 plan to use members of the Princes Trust to help lay the path. Cllr Stuart 
 reported that after discussions with Adrian Gibbs it was possible that an extra 
 grass cut would be necessary before the season ended due to the very wet and 
 muggy weather conditions this year which encouraged vigorous growth of the 
 grass. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>UPPER UP CAR PARK REFURBISHMENT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had spoken to Simon Clark of his suggestion on 
 the laying of a new surface on the car park. Mr Clark was currently very busy 
 and unable to commit at this time. Cllr Caunce posed the question: what is the 
 negative effect of doing nothing to the car park? Cllr Caunce suggested that a 
 cheaper option might well suffice and savings could be used for some other 
 scheme like the provision of accommodation for youngsters to have as a place to 
 congregate. Cllr Nicholas stated that careful thought should be applied as the 
 cost of the project would be quite large. It was best to investigate a cost 
 effective solution with the next step being to meet with Simon Clark. The 
 project was not pressingly urgent.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to contract James Harris Contracting for the tree work at Upper Up and Cerney 
 Wick play areas at a cost of £115 plus VAT. From four contractors contacted 
 only one had replied.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley reported that he had met with PCSO Mike 
 Owen and his new associate. The alleged disturbances at Robert Franklin Way 
 play area had been discussed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley was concerned with the barbed wire which 
 had been added to the kissing gate at the end of Huxley Court. Cllr Stuart 
 informed him that as the gate and pathway were permissive the land owner was 
 within his rights. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the eastern side of BSC13 
 needed to be cleared of overgrowing weeds. The Clerk will inform Mike Barton of 
 GCC PROW. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the refurbishment of the steps 
 at Bow Wow had been completed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge reported that an overgrowing Lime tree 
 outside Castle Gate in Silver Street causing inconvenience to the owners. The 
 Clerk will inform Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land was concerned with parking arrangements in 
 the cul-de-sacs in Berkeley Close. Cllr Stuart suggested that she contact Les 
 Haines (CDC) for advice. Cllr Webb produced a plan of the layout of the 
 development scheme including road works which clearly stated that the area in 
 the cul-de-sac was definitely included as a turning area. The Clerk was to 
 inform Gloucestershire Highways and request it to make it evident on the 
 carriageway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman agreed with a request from Cllr Caunce that 
 it might now be appropriate to give a report on the informal meeting held with 
 Mr Neudegg Chief Executive Officer at Cotswold District Council before this 
 Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart informed the meeting that Cllr Mrs Chapman, 
 Cllr Mrs Chubb, the Clerk, Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Messenger (CDC) also 
 attended. Mr Neudegg differed with Clive Bennett's assessment that a response 
 by the Parish Council is given the same weight as any other member of the 
 community. It was a pity at the time he said that, Clive was at the bar! 
 Planning issues and Watermark dominated the discussion. Mr Neudegg outlined his 
 plan to amalgamate the planning department under one umbrella and not as it 
 currently operates within the Heritage section at CDC. Planning, conservation, 
 building regs, enforcement would now come under a supremo and have closer 
 coordination within the system. Cooperation and not confrontation was his 
 objective. Checking on the occupancy of second homes continues within the 
 constraints of a person’s right to privacy was an on-going commitment. He would 
 like to promote overall savings on expenditure within the system when they had 
 been achieved rather than the plan. Generally the Parish Council works well 
 with the officers at CDC and both of our elected District Councillors regularly 
 attend our meetings and quickly action instances of concern we raise from time 
 to time. The Clerk encouraged Mr Neudegg to consider joining the 
 Gloucestershire Charter grouping. Numerous town and parish councils had joined 
 with Gloucestershire County Council but only one District Council was involved. 
 Further details could be found on GCC web site.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON
 MONDAY 10th AUGUST 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb 
 attended the meeting. Cllr Webb opened the meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Jay had sent an apology for his absence.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb noted that the expenditure detailed on the 
 spread sheet for period 4 was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee recommended that the 
 Finance Committee agrees to contract James Harris Contracting for the tree work 
 at Robert Franklin Way and Cerney Wick play areas. The Finance Committee had 
 not objected to the recommendation. At the Parish Council meeting it was 
 proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land that the contract is 
 awarded to James Harris Contracting. The Parish Council agreed unanimously.</p>

 with Somerford Keynes and Ashton Keynes Parish Councils to have the footpaths 
 associated with Cotswold Country Park (also previously known as Keynes Country

 consider sharing all pre-assessed costs of such a course of action. Cllr Caunce 
 seconded this motion for discussion. </p>

 parish councils involved on 20th July where Roger Sleeman had been appointed 
 Chairman of the group. The next meeting had been set for 17th August and Cllr

 Nicholas stated that he agreed in principle with the proposal although reserved 
 on the sharing of costs as there had been none in the recent example of the 
 application for the inclusion of the Barracks footpath in South Cerney. After a
