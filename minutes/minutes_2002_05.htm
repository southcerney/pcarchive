    <td width="100%"><p align="center"><strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    HELD IN THE VILLAGE HALL, SOUTH CERNEY<br>
    ON WEDNESDAY 8 MAY 2002</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Prior to the start of the Parish Council meeting Rev J. Calvert
    accompanied by Mr T. Squire attended a meeting of Parish Councillors. Chairperson Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner welcomed them and invited Rev Calvert to address the meeting. Rev Calvert
    outlined the implications and responsibilities of Parish Councils for graveyards and
    explained that lawfully the Parish Council is the Burial Authority although the Church at
    the moment deal with all matters regarding the use of the churchyard. In the past a joint
    committee was established comprising two members of the public, two members of the Parish
    Council and another resident. One Parish Councillor who had resigned from the Council had
    not been replaced and Rev Calvert would like to see the complement restored. Election to
    the Burial Authority was on the Parish Council agenda later in the evening. As the
    graveyard was nearing capacity a decision on whether to enlarge it or close it had been
    necessary. Against advice the Joint Committee agreed to enlarge and not to close the
    churchyard. A parcel of land owned by Lady Fanshawe adjoining the present graveyard had
    been successfully negotiated to enlarge the burial area but one of the conditions was that
    a stone wall should be extended to enclose it. A quotation for this wall which would be 74
    metres long had been agreed and with legal fees would cost approximately £8,200. This sum
    would have to be raised from within the community. The Parish Council had previously voted
    to donate between £1,000 and £2,500 towards the cost of reconstruction. In reply to a
    question from Cllr Harris, Rev Calvert said that it was impossible to accurately assess
    how long this new area could cope with more people opting for cremation. Rev Calvert and
    Mr Squire left the meeting at 7.22pm.</p>

    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Shorncote Sewage Pumping Station Visit</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to inform Ms L. Sale of Thames Water that Parish Councillors would be
    available to visit the pumping station at Shorncote on Tuesday 18 June at 6.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Web Site <a href="http://www.southcerney.org.uk">www.southcerney.org.uk</a></u><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that the site was now up and running and encouraged those at the
    meeting to use it, especially contribute to the discussion forum. He suggested that the
    Code of Conduct be made available and the Clerk would inform R. Fenton of a web link
    address which could be added to the site for this purpose. It was agreed that the web
    address be added to the Parish Council's letterhead.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Local Transport Needs</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart invited Mrs Smith, present as a member of the public, to join the
    sub-committee and she enthusiastically agreed. Cllr Mrs Spriggs was worried that the
    sub-committee would not have the support of future Parish Councils. Cllr Stuart explained
    that the policy of future Parish Councils could not be enforced but repeated his
    commitment that as long as he is a member of the Parish Council he will use his best
    endeavours to make sure that the sub-committee is supported. He envisaged that committee
    set up under the umbrella of the Vital Villages initiative would be an on-going group
    which would evolve as a focus group. Cllr Spriggs repeated that she was not happy with the
    situation as minuted and hoped that more attention would be paid to this new
    sub-committee's findings than was given to the Village Appraisal.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Code of Conduct</strong><br>
    The Clerk informed Parish Councillors that Mr Collis of Anchor, Station Road, South Cerney
    had inspected their register of interests on 26 April in the Village Hall. No further

    Residential redevelopment of Camas site to provide 30 dwellings at Camas Building
    Materials Ltd, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    The Committee had decided that the Parish Council should determine its recommendation at
    this meeting. Although the proposed development was outside the development boundary, Cllr
    Nicholas said that if the Parish Council was to object to the principle of residential
    development in Phase II that may be construed as being inconsistent bearing in mind
    previous decisions made by it. Vigorous debate followed with opinions divided on whether
    or not to object to the application. It was finally agreed to object to the application on
    the grounds that it was unacceptable that traffic flows exit the proposed development to
    Station Road. If permission was granted then the Parish Council agreed that the following
    conditions be imposed:<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area designated Public Open Space on the plan developers
    should fill in the water course<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traffic calming be implemented at all 4 (four) gateways to the

    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affordable housing be increased from 10% to 20%<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affordable housing be on a shared ownership basis<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A commuted sum (to be agreed) to equip proposed play area<br>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wooded area be left as a nature reserve with limited public access
    and a commuted sum (to be agreed) given to the Parish Council to maintain it<br>
    7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An assessment and upgrade if necessary of the sewerage system<br>
    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to the development should be to the south through Broadway
    Lane only<br>
    The Clerk was asked to enquire from the Planning Authority as to when the Section 106
    Agreement of Phase I would be implemented. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and
    seconded by Cllr Mrs Spriggs that the Parish Council objects to the application on the
    ground mentioned. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>

    <strong>Cycle Racks</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had nothing further to report.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart had carried out the inspections. He reported an accumulation of litter at
    Upper Up which had been exacerbated by recent grass cutting. Ground maintenance at Upper
    Up was very unsatisfactory and the contractor informed. Due to the lateness of the first
    cut further cropping had now compacted and the resulting hay should be removed. The cracks
    in the swing seats at Cerney Wick and Upper Up were showing signs of deterioration and the
    Clerk was asked to contact Wicksteed Leisure to quote for their repair. Cllr Stuart
    reported that weed growth was becoming a problem and Cllr Gardiner volunteered to spray
    it. The white lines on the basketball court would be attended to by Cllr Harris. The spoil
    from recent building work on the car park should be removed and the Clerk was to obtain
    quotations from A. C. Nurden Ltd, F. Timbrell, G. Woodhouse and Phoenix for the work. At
    Cerney Wick Cllr Mrs Chapman volunteered to sweep up light debris in the area by the play
    equipment. Cllr Mrs Chubb would carry out the inspections in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>WICKSTEED SAFETY REPORT</strong><br>
    As the entrapment points on the tower slide at Upper Up were considered a hazard the Clerk
    was to ask Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association (GPFA) for advice on how to modify
    access to the platform. Cllr Gardiner suggested that a ladder be attached to the side of
    the apparatus as an alternative means of entry. The slide at Cerney Wick which had failed
    the step riser test had been considered as low risk by the inspectors and no further
    action was warranted at this time. The paint work on the slide needed attention and the
    Clerk was asked to obtain quotations from R.O.W. Berry and Ian Budgen to treat the
    corrosion and repaint them in a similar colour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had met with Martin Portus on numerous occasions since the last Parish Council
    to discuss the progress or lack of it. The contractor who had submitted the lowest tender
    was showing signs of not being willing to accept the contract. Cllr Harris and Martin
    Portus will meet the contractor to discuss the situation on 13 May. Plans, including the
    water vole survey, had been submitted to the CDC for approval.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TRAFFIC BOLLARDS</strong><br>
    Mr &amp; Mrs Smith from the Old Police Station in Station Road had written to complain
    about the new traffic bollards which had been erected outside their property in Station
    Road and also a copy letter to and a reply from GCC Highways. They urged the Parish
    Council to object to the bollards which they had been informed were temporary and on trial
    but making access to their property difficult and dangerous. A further letter from A. J.
    Farmer of Englefield, Station Road was received complaining about the siting of the
    bollards. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish
    Council ask GCC Highways to remove the bollards. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>WALL AT ENGLEFIELD/LIMES</strong><br>
    The Clerk was to enquire from Westbury Homes what the intentions were for the eastern end
    of the original boundary wall fronting the development on Station Road.<br>
    <br>
    CT.CONTR1240<br>
    Notification of intention to undertake the felling of two cypress at Orchard House, South
    Cerney.<br>
    The Committee objected to the felling of trees in the Conservation Area. As the trees were
    on a boundary it considered they provided privacy and screening for neighbouring
    properties. It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish
    Council objects to this application. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    OBJECT<br>
    <br>
    <strong>ABANDONED VEHICLE</strong><br>
    Cllr Dunn asked the Clerk to report an abandoned vehicle in River Way in the vicinity of
    the garages and fire hydrant point.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HOLE IN CARRIAGEWAY</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to report to GCC Highways that a huge hole had appeared in the
    carriage outside the Londis in Broadway Lane near its junction with Berkeley Close.<br>
    <br>
