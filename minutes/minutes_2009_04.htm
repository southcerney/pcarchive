 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the Youth Parish Council attended the
 meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay requested that Mr Peter Redfern be invited to 
 attend any further meetings of the Traffic Working Party. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As Cllr Stuart and Cllr Jay had other engagements, Cllr 
 Mrs Land volunteered to attend the Police Consultative Committee meeting to be 
 held in Siddington on 15th April.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 23rd March I attended a meeting of the Play 
 Group at CDC. Cllr Stuart also attended. This group monitors the activities and 
 achievements of projects which have benefited from the Big Lottery Grant fund. 
 South Cerney is represented as it was granted £5,000 towards the cost of the 
 youth shelter. It is a worthwhile group as future grants and potential funders 
 are informally discussed and many tips on how to be successful in applying for 
 funds are exchanged. There is also direct contact with service providers who 
 could be useful. The meeting which started around 2pm closed at 3.45pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Also on Monday 23rd I attended a meeting in the Committee 
 Room of the Village Hall to discuss plans for the forthcoming official opening 
 of facilities at the Upper Up playing fields. There was a very good turnout of 
 people and the major decision was to change the date of the event from the 18th 
 April to 26th April. It would be necessary to make new arrangements with the 
 Silver Stars and GCC Youth Service who would be supplying the mobile skate 
 park. A list of people to invite was agreed and a personality may be persuaded 
 to attend the opening. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 26th I met with Sgt Matthew Holford, Silver 
 Stars to survey the drop site at Upper Up in preparation for its display on 
 Sunday 26th April. It was proposed that a competition prize of a tandem jump be 
 included although the Parish Council would be expected to guarantee the cost of 
 £195. The Gloucestershire Youth Service agreed to supply the skate park on the 
 new date. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 30th I attended a meeting of the Transport 
 Committee in the Village Hall. Five residents including two Parish Councillors 
 took part. Cllr Stuart opened the meeting and outlined the achievements of the 
 Village Plan regarding transport issues: speed limits; interactive signs; 
 meeting with Baillie Hamilton consultants on traffic matters in areas Clarks 
 Hay/Silver Street and High Street. Cllr Mrs Land suggested that an open traffic 
 plan design was not to be recommended as it could create more problems than it 
 solved. She continued that it would be more productive if tactile paving and 
 drop kerbs were installed as it was an offence for vehicles to obstruct these 
 sites. Enforcement of this is a police matter and will have a more enduring 
 effect than other means. Parking on pavements was another complaint. The Clerk 
 recommended that matters like this and speeding could be raised at the Police 
 Consultative Panel under the SARA plan. The next meeting will be held in the 
 Community Meeting Room, Elizabeth Road, Siddington on April 15th. Crossing 
 Clarks Hay was a constant problem for persons with restricted ambulation and 
 even fit elderly residents. Reducing the speed limit in the heart of the 
 village to 20 was another item on the “wish list”. David Roberts complained 
 that he and his wife Jennifer had been attending meetings like this for many 
 years and nothing ever seemed to be achieved. He was critical of Cllr Stuart 
 for obstructing the pedestrian crossing in High Street some time ago. He also 
 enquired which schemes the Parish Council objected to and emphasised the 
 negativity of his question. Cllr Stuart retorted that this plan for the 
 crossing had been rejected by Gloucestershire County Highways, as it was then, 
 because of a budget restraint and surveys which did not meet the criteria 
 necessary for its implementation. Cllr Stuart queried the validity of meetings 
 such as these if so few residents were prepared to attend. David Hughes 
 suggested that all businesses in the area should be contacted to enquire if 
 they had any suggestions on improving traffic conditions within the village. He 
 agreed to forward the Clerk a list of such businesses and a common letter could 
 be sent to each asking for their views. Mrs Roberts agreed to canvass opinion 
 from residents and forward results to the Clerk. The meeting which started at 
 6.05pm was brought to a close at 7.10pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Monday 6th April I attended a follow up meeting at 6pm 
 to plan for the official opening of the facilities at Upper Up. I confirmed 
 that the Silver Stars would perform a sky dive display on the rearranged date 
 and that Helen Jones was positive that the mobile skateboard park would be 
 available. A competition with tickets being sold on the day for £1 with a prize 
 of a tandem jump at a later date would be a feature. Mary Mychaleckyj and Emily 
 Hallett agreed to various tasks including the production of advertising 
 posters, face painting, and other interactive activities. The date for the next 
 meeting was agreed to take place at 7pm on Monday 20th April. As the meeting 
 ended two members of the Football Club arrived having misunderstood the start 
 time of the meeting. Cllr Stuart updated them on events. The meeting closed at 
 7.08pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During March of the 22 available working days I averaged 3 
 hours 53 minutes per day which is more than my contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart remarked that at the Traffic meeting he had 
 found the criticism from Mr &amp; Mrs Roberts too personal. He welcomed Cllr Mrs 
 Land’s suggestion to lay tactile paving slots with drop kerbs and the other 
 suggestion to reduce the speed limit in Silver Street and Clarks Hay to 20mph. 
 He would raise these points when he met with Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire 
 Highways.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 6th APRIL 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley and Cllr 
 Stuart attended the meeting. Cllr Stuart had opened the meeting at 7.10pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce thanked Cllr Stuart for standing in for him at 
 the Committee Meeting and requested that he carry on and make the report. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce apologised for his absence as he had to attend to business matters, 
 Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge apologised for their absence as they were 
 on vacation. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2520 – <b>Certification of MUGA</b>. The situation 
 has not changed. £2,000 is being withheld from Park Leisure’s account until the 
 remedial work had been satisfactorily completed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2510 – <b>Bus Shelter at the Lennards</b>. Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb had a meeting with PC Norgate, Gloucestershire Constabulary who had no 
 objection to the erection or siting of the proposed bus shelter. The site would 
 now be defined by spray marking and contractors asked to quote to cut out and 
 remove the turf, prepare a firm level base of approximately 6 inches depth of 
 concrete. The Clerk had asked Kevin Messenger, Dean Wheeler and Will Daniels to 
 quote for the work and their replies were awaited. Cllr Stuart reported that 
 the site had now been marked out in a blue spray. The Clerk will contact Paul 
 Swift, Gloucestershire Highways and ask him to inspect the proposed positioning 
 of the shelter and if necessary liaise with Cllr Caunce. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2510 – <b>“Shorncote Link”</b>. Cllr Stuart reported 
 that Murphy contractors had removed all their equipment from the site. Richard 
 Maggs had informed Stuart Milsom (MAI) that the outstanding work will be 
 completed shortly. The path from the Ashton Keynes to Cirencester Road to the 
 diversion leading to Keynes Country Park through Hills’ quarry has now been 
 gravelled and is in need of rolling to complete. Cllr Stuart had emailed Mike 
 Barton (GCC PROW) that the footbridge on the west of the Ashton Keynes road 
 needs suitable ramps to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Work on the Bow Wow steps by Steve Hanson and the Payback 
 in the Community team was awaited.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the 
 inspections at Robert Franklin Way play area. All was in order.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported that the pyracanthas hedge on the 
 northern side of the play area needed to be cut back to the fence line and 
 remove the resulting cuttings. The Clerk will ask contractors to tender. The 
 rest of the play area was in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported on the state of the play areas 
 facilities at Upper Up. He had asked the users of the cycle mounds to clear 
 away broken pallet timbers. The MUGA and shelter were being used more 
 frequently now that the weather had improved. The Big Lottery Fund stickers 
 have been removed yet again. The floor of the shelter has still not been 
 repainted. The Football Club has promised to make good the ruts caused by 
 contractors’ vehicles delivering material for the refurbishment of the changing 
 rooms. Murphy contractors has cultivated the working area and reseeded during 
 the past week.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PREPARATIONS FOR GRAND OPENING OF FACILITIES ON UPPER 
 UP PLAYING FIELDS </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A meeting had been held prior to this Committee meeting at 
 which Cllr Stuart reported on the progress made since the previous meeting on 
 23rd March. The event was to acknowledge the completion of several years’ work 
 by many groups including the Parish Council, Football Club, Cricket Club, 
 Tennis Club, Mountain Bikers, District and County Council Agencies (Public 
 Rights of Way and Cotswold Play Partnership) with finances from the Big Lottery 
 Fund, Landfill c/o Hills of Swindon, the Parish Council and CDC for making a 
 grant to help pay for the planting of new hedge. Events and participating 
 groups on the day will include the Silver Stars Free Fall parachute team 
 (depending on weather conditions), GCC Youth Services Mobile skateboard park 
 equipment, Football matches, Cricket coaching (in the new nets), Tennis,

 wander around the lake and picnic area; view the newly constructed football 
 pavilion, note the new MUGA and Youth Shelter; join in the fun and take part in 
 the attractions being put on by the clubs and by the Youth Organisations. The 
 event is planned for Sunday 26th April starting at 2pm although the skateboard 
 facility should be available from around 10am. The Silver Stars will make their 
 display around at 2.30pm. There will be a competition to win a tandem free fall 
 parachute jump. Refreshments and stalls will also be available. Cllr Kimberley 
 had telephoned Lucy Abel-Smith who would ask Dom Joly, a TV personality, if he 
 would be willing to open the event. Cllr Kimberley had informed the Clerk that 
 Mr Joly would not be available. Cllr Webb made his apologies for not being able 
 to attend the meeting on 20th nor the event on the 26th as he had church duties 
 which conflicted and he must attend. Cllr Harris reported that the compost bins 
 will be installed on 18th April. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PAINTING OF LINES ON BASKETBALL SIDE OF THE MUGA </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris stated that he had received a verbal quotation 
 of £200 plus VAT from Mr Houlton of Grimshaw to paint lines on the basketball 
 side of the MUGA. Cllr Harris had spoken to Joe Lodge who agreed, on behalf of 
 the Youth Parish Council, that it would be a good plan. The Clerk was asked to 
 inform the Finance Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>STREET TRADING APPLICATIONS </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed with Cllr Stuart who stated that the 
 Parish Council should not object to the application from three ice cream vans 
 to operate in South Cerney. The Clerk will inform CDC.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee agrees 
 to accept the quotation to paint lines on the basketball court side of the MUGA.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Due to another commitment Cllr Stuart would be unable to 
 attend the Police Panel meeting on April 15th in Siddington and requested that 
 another Parish Councillor take his place. As no one on the Committee 
 volunteered he would ask for someone to take his place at the Parish Council 
 meeting on Wednesday. See <b>Matters Arising</b> page 2530. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to write to Doltan Construction Ltd, 
 The Byre, Upper Siddington, Cirencester, Glos GL7 6HL which was developing 
 Chapel Cottage to point out that the back filling work on the trench leading 
 from the electricity pole adjacent to the gravel driveway leading to Ivy 
 Cottage back towards Chapel Cottage was unsatisfactory. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that he had retrieved the dog litter 
 bin from the river Churn in Bow Wow and left it in the bushes by the bridge at 
 Bridge House. The Clerk was to asked contractors to tender to re-erect the bin 
 on a new post on the northern verge of Bow Wow, below Silver Street bridge. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris complained that the sewage leak on Station 
 Road, the signs at the end of Station Road adjacent to Lake 10 and Spring Lake 
 and the fallen ash tree in Bow Wow had not been resolved. The Clerk will remind 
 the relevant authorities that these problems remain outstanding. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the gabion baskets and coir 
 rolls were still presenting a problem which needed to be resolved. Cllr Stuart 
 will raise this matter with Chris Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that the chain link fence at the 
 stile entering Robert Franklin Way play area from Lakeside needed to be taken 
 away and replaced with three rails. The Clerk will ask contractors to tender. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported that there is some garden rubbish 
 which has been discarded on the Piece at the junction of Box Bush and Station 
 Road. Cllr Jay had removed the items. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley requested that a dog litter bin positioned 
 at the entrance to Gypsy Lane, off Broadway Lane, needed to be moved in a 
 westerly direction towards the unofficial path which joins Beverstone Road. 
 Cllr Webb remarked that the position of the bin had been previously agreed and 
 it would not be prudent for it now to be moved.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk read the list of items on the Task List some of
 which had been accomplished and others outstanding but in hand.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee decided to note the receipt of a letter from 
 Mrs Sylvia Davis regarding trees she considers dangerous overhanging her back 
 garden. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Tree Report: Cllr Harris would prepare a list of urgent 
 tree work and present it for evaluation at the Parish Council meeting on 
 Wednesday evening. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris listed a number of jobs mentioned in the Tree 
 Report he considered needed urgent attention. The removal of a dead Birch tree 
 in Jubilee Gardens; the removal of limbs of Ash trees in Robert Franklin Way 
 play area; the removal of limbs on the Lime tree next to the VAS sign in Silver 
 Street. Cllr Harris quoted £55 plus VAT for this work. Cllr Jay stated that his 
 quote would be discussed when he made the report of the Finance Committee 
 later. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Stuart had closed the 
 meeting at 8.28pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY
 6th APRIL 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land and Cllr Webb had attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas had made an apology for his absence as he was on vacation.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SPREAD SHEET ANALYSIS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay noted that with the period completed the 
 expenditure detailed on the spread sheet was in order.. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCEPTANCE FROM THE PLAYING FIELDS
 AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to the verbal quote from Mr 
 Houlton of Grimshaw to paint lines on the basketball side of the MUGA for £200 
 plus VAT. Cllr Harris had spoken to Joe Lodge who agreed, on behalf of the 
 Youth Parish Council, that it would be a good idea. The Finance Committee was 
 not convinced that the Youth Parish Council had been properly consulted. Joe 
 Lodge should be requested to convene a meeting of the council and find out its 
 view. The Parish Council was in agreement with the deliberation of the Finance 
 Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay asked Cllr Harris who had a prejudicial interest 
 as a potential contractor to leave the room while this next item was being 
 discussed. He also asked the member of the public to leave the room as the 
 content of the item was considered confidential. Both complied with the 
 request. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Two quotations had been received for work specified in the 
 Tree Report. The Parish Council was prepared to award the contract to Tim 
 Bryant if he agreed to include in his quotation, cutting back the pyracantha 
 hedge on Cerney Wick play area all for £125. It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and 
 seconded by Cllr Jay that if Tim Bryant agreed the Parish Council would award 
 him the contract. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris and the member of the public returned to the 
 room.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SUSTENANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR UPPER UP OPENING EVENT </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Finance Committee agreed to recommend that the Parish 
 Council commits itself to a total expenditure of £250 to cover eventualities at 
 the Upper Up event. This would include underwriting the cost of the tandem 
 parachute jump if the competition did not raise sufficient funds and the cost 
 of advertising verbally quoted by Mary Mychaleckyj at £15.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb objected to the content of an explanatory letter 
 received from Ben Bendall (CDC Planning). Cllr Webb considered some of his 
 correspondence objectionable especially his comment: “this Authority considers 
 the use of traditional materials such as roughcast render to be a more 
 appropriate material, despite other inferior materials such as Bradstone being 
 used in the past”. The fact that Ward members had been aware of the decision 
 and then not informed the PC was also disturbing. The Parish Council is well 
 aware that the District is not obliged to consult the Parish Council but if 
 there is not going to be an exchange of views then what is the point of a 
 Parish Council Planning Committee? </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed that the Clerk should write to 
 the Chief Executive Officer at CDC, copying the letter to its Leader, Cllr Mrs 
 Jeffrey and Ward Councillors pointing out the possible litigation opportunity 
 afforded by describing Bradstone as an inferior product. The fact that the Ward 
 Members did not inform the Parish Council of other matters regarding the 
 application was disappointing. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Webb had closed the 
 meeting at 9.26pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CALOR GAS VILLAGE OF THE YEAR COMPETITION</b> </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Parsons hoped that a solution could be found to the 
 problem regarding ownership of the Poplar trees in Bow Wow. The back-filling of 
 Lake 16 was a District Council matter. He acknowledged that there were problems 
 with the Police Liaison Consultative meetings and Cllr Stuart updated him as to 
 the current obligations of the combined services. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay complained about the signs in the vicinity of 
 Station Road, Spine Road and Cerney Wick Lane. A new sign, in yellow and black, 
 had been added to the chain link fence which advertised houses for sale in the 
 village. Cllr Stuart will add this complaint to his list to discuss with Chris 
 Franklin, Gloucestershire Highways. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb suggested that if the Planning Department at CDC 
 did not respond to the constant reminders about the advertising at the 
 aforementioned crossroads the complaints should be made to a higher level. Cllr 
 Caunce suggested that a member of the Planning Department should be invited to 
 attend a meeting with Parish Councillors to explain its reluctance to act. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay stated that he had attended a seminar on 19th 
 March at CDC on Climate Change at Trinity Road. It was excellent and well worth 
 the £24 investment by the Parish Council for his entry. It was a superb 
 presentation. He was disappointed that only one CDC member attended and that 
 was only for the first part even though their entry was free. He feared that 
 the current leadership at district level showed little interest for the future 
 of climate change. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman complained about vehicles leaving Lake 
 10, Waters Edge, without due regard for oncoming traffic. The member of the 
 public suggested that a white line is painted to denote the priority on the 
 bend. Cllr Stuart would add the suggestion to his list of items when he met 
 with Mr Franklin.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce congratulated the clean up team which had done 
 such a superb job throughout Cerney Wick. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land enquired on behalf of Mrs J. Roberts who 
 wished to know if she was on the Traffic Committee. The Parish Council decided 
 that there was no committee but the group should be known as a working party. 
 Under Standing Orders a working party could be set up to advise the Parish 
 Council on ideas for change. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that the Waste Service was not 
 conforming to the agreement that it should clean up the Upper Up recycling area 
 once a week. Recently large amounts of rubbish had been left and in one 
 instance polystyrene material which had then been broken up and dispersed over 
 the playing fields. The Parish Council will discuss the problem at its next 
 meeting and Cllr Stuart will argue for the recycling bins to be removed if the 
 clean up operation does not improve. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">A static living caravan, two storage bins and a mobile 
 toilet had been reported sited on Lake 16 near to the footpath leading from 
 Huxley Court. The Parish Clerk was to ask the Enforcement Officer to 
 investigate.</p>
