    The Chairman, Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.35 pm 
    wishing the Parish Councillors present a happy New Year, hoping that 
    discussions would be brief and asked them to give the various Committees 
    respect for their recommendations.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce had apologised for his absence due to work commitments and Cllr 
    Baines (CDC) had emailed his apology for his absence.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Smith that the 
    Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was 
    in favour. Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    There were no matters arising which had not been dealt with at Committee 
    stage.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    On Tuesday 4th January I attended a meeting of the Finance Committee to 
    discuss the precept. During the month of December I averaged 3 hrs 6 minutes 
    per available day which was 24 minutes per day less than my contracted 
    hours.<br>
    <br>
    <b>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Committee which had met on 
    Monday 10th January.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Zebra Crossing/Traffic Speed</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that he had again telephoned Mr Whittaker who stated that 
    he would make a reply in due course.<br>
    <b>Interactive Speed Signs</b><br>
    Cllr Squire had met with Ged Cassell (CDC) on 11th January. Initially three 
    signs would be installed probably with an upper financial contribution limit 
    of 40% from the Parish Council and the rest from a CDC grant. Cllr Squire 
    accepted that it would not be possible to present an installation plan for 
    grant aid until the next meeting on March 12th. The positioning of the signs 
    would depend on a suitable electricity supply and agreement with GCC 
    Highways.<br>
    <b>Outstanding Work at Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that none of the outstanding maintenance matters 
    reported to the Cotswold Water Park Society had been resolved.<br>
    <b>Safety Surfaces</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart had a meeting with Mr G. Taylor who gave quotations to replace 
    the tiled safety surfaces at the three play areas. Cllr Stuart analysed the 
    costs as follows:<br>
    Remove Tiles Fenplay Soft Fall EPDM Wetpour<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick</b><br>
    Swing £810 £2,135 £2,705<br>
    Climb £695 £1,985 £2,645<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way</b><br>
    Slide £945 £2,995 £3,615<br>
    <b>Upper Up</b><br>
    Junior Swing £375 £995 £1,195<br>
    Swing £395 £1,025 £1,295<br>
    Multiplay £1,235 £3,950 £4,725<br>
    £4,455 £13,085 £16,180<br>
    Slide/Ladder: £675 (only in conjunction with one or two items of safety 
    surfaces)<br>
    If the choice is for the Wetpour (maintenance free) and use of the services 
    of Mr Taylor to remove existing tiles:<br>
    £16,180 + £4,455 + £675 = £21,310<br>
    or: Work party (courtesy of Cerney Wick Committee, for example) removes 
    tiles:<br>
    £16,855 + hire of skip(s) @ £200 = £17,055<br>
    or: Use Fenplay Soft Fall @ £13,085 + £675 = £13,760 plus skip(s) @ £200 = 
    £13,960<br>
    <br>
    <b>Ground Maintenance Schedule</b><br>
    The following areas were added to the schedule: Kingfisher Place and the 
    area opposite Londis; the bank of the Mill Stream between Riverway, along 
    BSC4 to stile at west of Riverway; the Churchyard extended area including 
    the entrance to the allotments. During the deliberations of the Finance 
    Committee the Parish Council agreed with the recommendation of the Committee 
    to extend the existing contract for a further two years subject to the 
    appointed contractor’s continuing standard of performance.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Annual Safety Inspections</b><br>
    During the deliberations of the Finance Committee the Parish Council agreed 
    with the recommendation of the Committee to appoint John Hicks to carry out 
    the inspections as his quotation was the most competitive.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Rubbish Bin in Clarks Hay</b><br>
    The Clerk had contacted R. Sollis (CDC) to request that a bin be installed 
    at the new seat in Clarks Hay. According to Mr Sollis there were no bins 
    available or money in the budget to purchase any and he referred the Clerk 
    to his suppliers although he did agree to install the bin and arrange for it 
    to be emptied if the Parish Council made the purchase. During the 
    deliberations of the Finance Committee the Parish Council agreed with the 
    recommendation of the Committee to the purchase of a new bin.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Refurbishment of the chain link fence at Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest as a potential contractor for 
    this work and left the meeting.<br>
    Three quotations had been received and during the deliberations of the 
    Finance Committee the Parish Council agreed with the recommendation of the 
    Committee to appoint J.T. Fencing to carry out the work as its quotation was 
    the most competitive.<br>
    Cllr Harris rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Refurbishment of Upper Up car park</b><br>
    As only one quotation had been received, the Committee proposed that Cllr 
    Stuart liaise with a local contact to do the work and if that quotation was 
    approximately 50% of the received quote, then permission should be given. 
    During the deliberations of the Finance Committee the Parish Council agreed 
    with the recommendation of the Committee<br>
    <br>
    <b>Councillors’ Reports</b><br>
    Cllr Harris asked that a street light be installed in the vicinity of the 
    new footbridge in Bow Wow to illuminate the disabled access there. The Clerk 
    informed him that a request for such a light was made in October. Cllr 
    Stuart volunteered to ring Mr Greenaway to expedite the request.<br>
    Cllr Harris informed the Committee of a proposal to change the name of the 
    Cotswold Water Park which had existed for more than 30 years. Various 
    suggestions were being touted but Cllr Harris was not impressed. The 
    Committee was unanimous in its agreement and recommended that the Parish 
    Council rejects any plan to change the name of the water park. Cllr Smith 
    remarked that without knowing what new name was proposed it was impossible 
    to make a decision. If and when a name change was proposed further 
    discussion could take place.<br>
    Cllr Harris asked that cycleway signs on the south side of Station Road be 
    installed to inform cyclists of the available route which would allow them 
    to avoid using the carriageway.<br>
    Cllr Harris asked about the bridge survey. The Clerk referred him to recent 
    correspondence which informed the Parish Council that an inspection was due 
    in the week beginning 13th December and a report would follow.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the water hydrant sign (H) and safety valve in 
    the ditch opposite Oakbeams in Station Road were now visible and should be 
    reinstated.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the road sign (Station Road) at the junction of 
    the Spine Road (B4696) and Station Road was missing and should be replaced.<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that the street sign opposite the Royal Oak signing 
    Jubilee Gardens was missing and should be replaced.<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that debris from an accident opposite Well Cottage and 
    between Orchard House in Upper Up was littering the road verge and asked 
    that it be collected. Compacted leaves which had been swept off the footpath 
    on to the carriageway had blown back and needed to be cleared away.<br>
    Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb would attend a meeting of local bodies at the 
    Millennium Centre, Keynes Park at 10am on 25th January to discuss 
    alternative PROWs in the vicinity of the Cotswold Community when that area 
    will be gravelled.<br>
    Cllr Webb reported an accumulation of fallen leaves and other detritus on 
    the pathway connecting Sudeley Drive and Oak Way which should be cleared.<br>
    Cllr Squire informed the Committee that the stone from the War Memorial 
    which had been damaged by vandals had been removed. The Memorial can be 
    repaired and an estimate for the work is awaited. Promises of donations 
    towards a reward for the apprehension of those responsible had been received 
    but Cllr Jay warned that any reward offered could be counter productive.<br>
    In response to a query on the web site the Clerk had ascertained that the 
    Heritage Service (CDC) was responsible for the maintenance of the cycle 
    track on the Spine Road. Malcolm Watt, Head of Heritage informed the Clerk 
    that plans were in hand to commute a sum to the Cotswold Water Park for 
    future upkeep.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas suggested that there was an abundance of public seating in the 
    vicinity of the Old Cross and that the double seat at the Old Cross might be 
    sited elsewhere. Cllr Jay pointed out that the seat had been a gift from 
    CAMAS to the Parish to commemorate the Millennium and should not be moved 
    without its consent.<br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that all equipment was in working order. The new drain 
    pipe recently installed was performing well and the cycle mounds were still 
    being used. The third soccer pitch has been mown and the second pitch marked 
    out and in use. The Football Club has requested that a dog mess bin be 
    placed in the car park. Overall there was very little litter in evidence.<br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that all equipment was in working order. The lamination 
    of one panel on the adventure unit in the toddlers’ play area was peeling 
    and should be either removed or turned over. The entrance at Robert Franklin 
    Way was becoming muddy and needed some gravel. Cllr Squire suggested that 
    over matter from the path to Bow Wow via the Church could be used.<br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
    order.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>FINANCE</b><br>
    Cllr Smith reported on the deliberations of this Committee which had met on 
    Monday 10th January.<br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    <b>Water Park Fund</b><br>
    Malcolm Watt, Head of Heritage (CDC) confirmed that there was £56,189.17 in 
    the Cotswold Water Park fund although the majority of it was already 
    allocated. Verbally, Mr Watt informed the clerk that further large deposits 
    from S.106 agreements were expected although none of this future income was 
    as yet allocated. One suggestion for use of the fund which would benefit the 
    Cotswold Water Park and South Cerney was to create a path from the end of 
    Upper Up playing field to Keynes Park. The Parish Council had already 
    created a path from its car park to near its western boundary but further 
    work was needed to be carried out to extend the path to cross over the shire 
    brook and the narrow spit of land to the Ashton Keynes/Cirencester road to 
    connect with the existing footpath BSN9 to Keynes Park. In conjunction with 
    this scheme the Parish Council would like a grant to plant further trees and 
    shrubs in the wetland area at the western end of Upper Up playing field. The 
    Clerk was asked to make this subject an agenda item for discussion at the 
    February meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Receipts</b><br>
    R. O. W. Berry Donation £350.00<br>
    South Cerney Cricket Club Water supply to Upper Up playing field £5.36 South 
    Cerney Football Club Water supply to Upper Up playing field £8.04<br>
    £363.40<br>
    <b>Outstanding</b><br>
    R. Hewer Notice board repair £165.00<br>
    <br>
    <b>Payments Out</b><br>
    Petty Cash Bus Shelter Cleansing (January) £40.00<br>
    Petty Cash Litter Picking (January) £100.00<br>
    M. McKee Clerk’s Travel (December) £70.20<br>
    M. McKee BT Telephone and Internet access (December) £23.00<br>
    Thames Water Water supply to Upper Up playing field £13.40<br>
    Southern Electric Unmetered electricity supply to bus shelters £10.94<br>
    SLCC Annual Subscription 2005 £91.00<br>
    Busy Fingers Copying Photocopying £45.97<br>
    Maelor Trafflex Ltd Supply 90 litre green rubbish bin £142.76<br>
    £537.27<br>
    Cllr Smith has previously inspected and agreed the Clerk’s travel expenses 
    for December. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard 
    that the Parish Council agrees to make the above payments. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Quotations</b><br>
    The Finance Committee accepted the deliberations of the Village Maintenance 
    Committee on the following quotations: 1. John Hicks (Safety Inspections); 
    2. Rubbish Bin (Clarks Hay);<br>
    3. J. T. Fencing (Robert Franklin Way chain link fence); 4. Refurbishment of 
    Upper Up car park (Cllr Stuart to negotiate as agreed). It was proposed by 
    Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agrees to the 
    recommendations of the Finance Committee. The Parish Council was all in 
    favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Precept Meeting</b><br>
    The Committee had met on Tuesday 4th January 2005 at the Old Police House 
    and recommended the Parish Council to precept £61,295. This sum represented 
    a monthly increase on band ‘D’ properties of 62p on the previous year. It 
    was proposed by Cllr Smith and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council 
    agrees with the recommendation of the Finance Committee. The Parish Council 
    was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Clerk’s New Contract, Terms and Conditions</b><br>
    Cllr Jay had read the proposals and concluded that there would not be a 
    great difference between the current agreement and the new terms which would 
    be implemented from 1st April 2005. The Clerk had asked SLCC how much the 
    proposed evaluation service would cost but the society had not yet decided, 
    although a decision was imminent.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>PLANNING</b><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on Monday 10th January.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Wheel Washing</b><br>
    A. R. Jones (CDC) wrote to explain that there was no specific reason for the 
    omission of a wheel washing condition which was not a deliberate act.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Determination of Application (CT.4498/W Four Pillars Hotel)</b><br>
    A. R. Jones (CDC) explained that the Planning Committee was mindful of the 
    concerns expressed by the Parish Council. The principle of a development of 
    this character and scale had already been established and the design 
    approach followed was felt to be appropriate to its waterside location. 
    Great care will be taken with the final choice of building materials – it is 
    not normally the case that such final choices are made at this stage.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Lighting Control Policy</b><br>
    A. R. Jones (CDC) explained that there was no lighting control policy as 
    such, though Policy 18 of the current Local Plan, in the section on 
    Pollution, states that “Permission will not be given for developments ... 
    that are likely to cause ... unacceptable light levels and spillage”. When 
    applications are being considered which have the potential to cause light 
    pollution problems, we impose a condition that effectively removes any 
    ‘permitted development’ rights to install external lighting, thereby 
    requiring an application to be submitted.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Jubilee Gardens Public Art</b><br>
    Rachael Stanway emailed that the Glos Environmental Trust Company had 
    granted £8,573 to add to the existing budget for Jubilee Gardens.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.2443/P (Berkeley Close)</b><br>
    Cllr Webb had concerns that permission for this development would be granted 
    despite the assurances given by A. R. Jones (CDC) to Geoffrey Clifton Brown 
    MP, and the report to the CDC from Thames Water and Halcrow. Outline 
    planning permission had already been granted and it was reserved matters 
    which were being determined. Cllr Bennett (CDC) informed the Parish Council 
    that the application had been deferred that morning. It was agreed that 
    residents should be informed through the Cerney News of a proposal to put in 
    place a Prevention of Driving Order as part of the planning permission for 
    new houses along Berkeley Court. The proposal seeks to prohibit vehicles 
    driving the full length of the Close, as it is thought that there is good 
    access from other roads within the village. Cllr Nicholas produced a copy of 
    a S.106 agreement originated in a neighbouring District Council which 
    innovatively provided a payment per bedroom per property and suggested to 
    Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) that a similar scheme might be 
    adopted by the Cotswold District Council. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) noted that 
    whereas the CDC demanded a 30% provision of affordable housing the 
    neighbouring district council required only 25%. Cllr Nicholas was 
    interested in some sort of compensation for the loss of the playground and 
    the Parish Council agreed that the Clerk should ask Mr A. R. Jones CDC Head 
    of Planning for an amount to be considered when the Planning (Regulatory) 
    Committee next met to determine the deferred application.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</b><br>

    Cllr Smith declared a prejudicial interest as a neighbour and left the 
    debate.<br>

    The ground floor extension is of a design that is not in keeping with 
    vernacular style, and the new front windows will disrupt the cohesive design 
    and style of this prominent and carefully co-ordinated development.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish 
    Council ratifies the decision of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council 
    was in favour.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    Cllr Smith rejoined the debate.<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish 
    Council does not object to this application. The Parish Council was in 
    favour.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    Cllr Stuart rejoined the debate.<br>
    <br>
    With the exception of CT.0006/4/C and CT.8421/B which had already been voted 
    on it was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Squire that the Parish 
    Council accepts the recommendations of the Planning Committee. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>

    Revised lodge type for Plot 14 at Lake 16, Spine Road, South Cerney<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0223/A</b><br>
    Alterations to vehicular access serving Drenewyd and The Old House at 
    Drenewyd, High Street, South Cerney<br>
    Conditions to note: 4. The development shall not be brought into use until 
    the vehicle parking and manoeuvring facilities for Drenewyd have been 
    completed in all respects in accordance with the approved details and they 
    shall be similarly maintained thereafter for that purpose. Reason: In the 
    interests of highway safety, and in order to ensure that the development 
    complies with Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 47. 5. The existing 
    vehicular access to the site shall be stopped up, its use permanently 
    abandoned and the verge/footway crossing reinstated in accordance with 
    details which shall be approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. 
    Such works shall be completed within one month of the new vehicular access 
    hereby authorised being first brought into use. Reason: In the interests of 
    highway safety in accordance with Cotswold District Council Local Plan 
    Policy 46 and PPG13. 7. Notwithstanding the approved plans the proposed 
    vehicular access shall not be brought into use until the existing frontage 
    boundaries either side of the vehicular access have been removed to provide 
    visibility splays extending from a point 2.0 metres back from the 
    carriageway edge along the access centre line to a point on the nearside 
    carriageway edge 55 metres to the nearside (east) and 10 metres to the 
    carriageway edge to the offside (west). Any new boundary, fence or other 
    enclosure shall be erected on or behind the splay lines so defined, with the 
    area in advance maintained permanently clear of obstructions to visibility 
    at a height not exceeding 0.9 metres above the adjacent carriageway level. 
    Reason: To ensure that adequate visibility is provided and maintained in the 
    highway safety, and in accordance with PPG13 and Cotswold District Local 
    Plan Policy 46.<br>

    <b>CT.3704/K</b><br>
    Construction of first floor extension above sun room and adjacent ground 
    floor and first floor extension, to provide two (2) bedrooms, and ground 
    floor study or wc at Rose Cottage, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    Reason: The application site comprises a detached period cottage which 
    exhibits the scale, form, and proportions of traditional vernacular 
    architecture. The proposal, by virtue of its scale, form, design and 
    massing, would excessively dominate and be incongruous to this simple, 
    traditionally proportioned cottage, thereby being harmful to its intrinsic 
    character. The proposal is therefore contrary to guidance contained within 
    PPG1 and Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1 and 40.<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.6460/G</b><br>
    Outline application for the erection of two (2) dwellings and vehicular 
    access on land to the rear of 17-22 The Leaze, South Cerney<br>
    Reasons: 1. Residential development on any part of the application site 
    would occupy a backland position behind the existing street frontage. As 
    such the provision of two dwellings on this site would be out of keeping 
    with the settlement pattern and would result in an incongruous development, 
    unsympathetic with the form and character of the settlement and the 
    surroundings of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 1 
    and 40 of the adopted Cotswold District Local Plan and Government guidance 
    contained in PPG1 (General Policy and Principles) and PPG3 (Housing). 2. 
    Insufficient information has been submitted to satisfactorily determine the 
    highway safety implications concerning the development. As such the proposal 
    is contrary to Policies 1 and 46 of the adopted Cotswold District Local 
    Plan, the Gloucestershire County Transport Plan and Government Guidance 
    contained in PPG1 (General Policy and Principles) and PPG13 (Transport).<br>

    <b>FLOOD REPORT</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard, Cllr Mrs Chapman and Cllr Caunce were waiting to view the 
    video which was in circulation. Cllr Nicholas commented that once the video 
    had been viewed it encouraged one to become involved in preparing for a 
    future incident. Cllr Stuart queried what plans our District Council and 
    County Council had for a repeat incident. Cllr Parsons (GCC) said that the 
    County Council was working with the Environment Agency and emergency 
    services. He would ask the Emergency Planning Officer to contact the Clerk 
    who would arrange for him to give a presentation to the Parish Council. Cllr 
    Bennett (CDC) said that the District Council had an emergency plan but did 
    not elaborate. He encouraged the Parish Council to form an Emergency Sub 
    Committee to help deal with any future incident. Cllr Stuart suggested that 
    a Parish Neighbour Scheme be implemented. It was decided to await the 
    outcome of a presentation by the County Council Emergency Planning Officer 
    before any plans were made for action.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COUNCILLORS’ PORTFOLIOS</b><br>
    At a conference attended by the Clerk it had been suggested that members of 
    a Council could become more involved with Council business if they were 
    involved with specific portfolios. Parish Councillors agreed that Committee 
    Chairmen would be responsible for correspondence relating to their 
    Committees. The following portfolios were agreed to by Parish Councillors:<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb – Aged; Cllr Squire – Aged and Transport; Cllr Mrs Pollard – 
    Village Plan; Cllr Jay – Youth, Education and Health; Cllr Mrs Chapman – 
    Cerney Wick matters; Cllr Harris – Flood, Tree Warden, Snow Warden and 
    Environmental Matters; Cllr Webb – Village Hall representative and Tree 
    Warden; Cllr Stuart – Water Park representative; Cllr Nicholas – Thames 
    Water and Sewerage.<br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE PLAN</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart was in regular contact with Mel Tarrant (GRCC). Cllr Mrs Pollard 
    was analysing the wall sheets for further action. Three residents had shown 
    an interest in joining sub committees and the Clerk would inform them that 
    the plan was progressing and a sub committee would be formed within six 
    weeks time.<br>
