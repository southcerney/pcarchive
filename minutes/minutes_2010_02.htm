 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land had sent an apology for her absence as she 
 was unwell.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 13th JANUARY 2010</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Chubb 
 that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Members of the Parish Council 
 were all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge reported that due to study and examinations 
 intervening no meetings of the Youth Parish Council (YPC) had taken place since 
 the last report although one was scheduled for tomorrow (11th February). Cllr 
 Nicholas asked Joe if the YPC on the Parish Council’s website could be updated. 
 Joe will investigate and act if necessary.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Four Pillars advertising framework</b> <br>
 The Clerk was to enquire from the Enforcement Officer if the framework which 
 had supported the large advertisements could also be removed in order to 
 forestall further displays.</p>

 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 26th January I attended a meeting of the 
 Charter group at the Fire Station, Barnwood. This meeting had been rearranged 
 due the weather on the previous date and as a consequence was poorly attended 
 with only about 20 representatives turning up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless there was an interesting presentation by 
 Karen Watson GCC Partnership Manager, Children and Young People’s Directorate 
 on how disadvantaged children’s needs were being catered for in the county. 
 Since the Children’s Act 2004 had come into force presaged by the Victoria 
 Climbié incident, local authorities throughout the United Kingdom have been 
 improving their services. Gloucestershire is now divided into 7 management 
 areas called Locality Hubs. There are 120 personnel directly employed by the 
 department in administering the service which is the first point of contact 
 regarding child concerns. The hubs support multi agency groups and are 
 pro-active with sustained and coordinated early intervention. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Chris Rogan Head of Gloucestershire Highways gave a 
 lengthy explanation of the problems currently being experienced by his 
 department: lack of salt and whether to mix it with sand which can clog up the 
 drains when the ice melts away and also create slippery conditions when the 
 material dries up; the enormous increase in pot hole damage which must be 
 addressed with an ever decreasing budget; rearranging contracts to cater for 
 the repair of roads. Because of the method used to repair pot holes where the 
 surface must be relaid the hole itself should be dry and clean before new 
 material is introduced and weather conditions are mostly not suitable. Long 
 term experiments are in place to help determine the most suitable type of 
 repair but conclusive results are still some way off. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 5th February I attended the inaugural meeting of 
 potential allotment holders in the Village Hall. Twenty five residents attended 
 plus Cllr Caunce, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart. The group was keen to form a 
 club and Cllr Stuart assured them that they would have every practical support 
 from the Parish Council in becoming established. A follow up meeting has been 
 arranged for 12th February. Cllr Jay sent his apology for absence. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During January of the 20 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours per day which is roughly 3 hours per week less than my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; 
 PLAYING FIELDS COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 8TH FEBRUARY 2010</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr Mrs Land came as 
 an observer as the timing of the Planning Committee had been incorrectly 
 published as starting at the same time as the Village Maintenance and Playing 
 Fields Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Kimberley had made an apology for his absence as his 
 wife was unwell. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2632 – <b>Public Rights of Way.</b> Cllr Stuart 
 quoted from an email received from Matthew Millett, Operations Director at the 
 Cotswold Water Park Society on the various options available regarding work on 
 replacing the stiles with kissing gates and installation of a boardwalk in 
 Wildmoorway Lane. The three options were: Option 1 – The Parish Council decides 
 to support both stiles removal and boardwalk (a cash contribution of £3,500 as 
 match funding would be needed as Cotswold Water Park Society will provide the 
 remaining £21,000); Option 2 – To support the stiles (CWP will need a cash 
 contribution of £700 as match funding and will then provide the remaining 
 £7,800); Option 3 – The Parish Council may only wish to support the boardwalk (CWP 
 will need a cash contribution of £1,960 as match funding but will then provide 
 the remaining £14,040). Cllr Caunce suggested that Options 2 and 3 provided the 
 best value. Whether a boardwalk or a raised path was the better option was then 
 discussed. Cllr Harris was in favour of a raised path. It was not considered 
 that a boardwalk was the best option for users with wheelchairs or prams as due 
 to its width, passing by in opposite directions could be problematic and the 
 structure would not give a long term solution. Finally it was decided that 
 Option 2 was best and the Clerk was asked to recommend the decision to the 
 Finance Committee to provide £700 as match funding to support the replacement 
 of 25 stiles with kissing gates by the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2632 – <b>Eastern Canal Partnership</b>. Cllr Stuart 
 confirmed that he and Cllr Jay had attended a meeting of the Partnership on 
 21st January. Overall the meeting was very interesting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2632 – <b>Upper Up car park</b>. Cllr Harris 
 explained the challenging circumstances he found when along with Fred Timbrell 
 they worked to regrade the surface of the Upper Up car park. Cllr Harris had 
 determined after inspection with a mini digger that the lack of drainage is the 
 major problem. Standing water was proving difficult to drain as an impermeable 
 layer of aggregate had formed under sections of the car park. This phenomenon 
 prevented water from draining and would need to be broken up to allow the top 
 surface covering to dry out and harden. Standing water is more evident on the 
 flat surface of the car park than on those parts which slope. There are further 
 complications in identifying underground services which must be determined 
 before the offending layer can be broken up. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris left the room as the debate continued on 
 whether to recommend payment to James Harris Contracting for his work on the 
 car park. It was agreed that the work which was quoted for was carried out as 
 the specification expected but unforeseen circumstances had contrived to create 
 the current state of the car park and the contractor could not be held 
 responsible. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that 
 payment should be recommended to the Finance Committee. The Committee was all 
 in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris returned to the room as discussions continued 
 on how best to resolve the problem. Cllr Harris suggested that it would need a 
 further 16 tonnes of gravel to be applied. Note was taken but it was finally 
 agreed that a professional should be contacted to provide a specification on 
 how to remedy the problem. Cllr Harris will have further discussions with Fred 
 Timbrell and Cllr Stuart will contact Paul Swift from Gloucestershire Highways 
 to see if he could suggest a solution or recommend someone who might. Cllr 
 Caunce asked that the item is on the committee’s agenda for next month.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had since been in contact with Paul Swift from 
 Gloucestershire Highways who told him that he had no experience in how to deal 
 with the problem but that he would enquire from colleagues. He had been unable 
 to contact Mr Grosscurth from James Slater &amp; Co as he was on holiday but had 
 left a message asking him to ring when he returned. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2632 – <b>Keystoke hedge.</b> Cllr Stuart had spoken 
 to Mrs Sheila Dickson about the overgrowing hedge which was obscuring the 
 street light. She was noncommittal and would discuss the item with her husband. 
 The Clerk was to inform Barry Greenaway from Gloucestershire Street Lighting 
 and ask him to write to Mr &amp; Mrs Dickson about the matter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2633 – <b>Damage to Cherry tree.</b> The Clerk had 
 written to Miss Lodge asking for information on the alleged person responsible 
 but had not received a reply. Joe Lodge had given the Clerk the name and 
 address of the person and her insurance company of the person concerned. The 
 Clerk will contact the insurance company and ask for compensation. Page </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">2633 – <b>Damage to public seat at Preaching Cross.</b> 
 Cllr Nicholas will continue negotiations with Matthew King to resolve the 
 problem. The Committee is minded that a compromise could be reached with 
 Matthew whereby he might be persuaded to source and fit wheels to the recently 
 acquired shredder/chipper. Cllr Caunce was of the opinion that the damaged seat 
 could be sold either to a local reclamation company or auctioned on E-Bay. The 
 Clerk was to enquire from CDC if it would move the “Clarks Hay” street sign to 
 the opposite side of the road, alongside the wall by South Cerney Farmhouse. 
 The Clerk had contacted Rob Bull at CDC who will resite the sign. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2634 – <b>Allotments at Upper Up.</b> An inaugural 
 meeting of potential allotment holders had been held in the Village Hall on 
 Friday 5th February. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and the Clerk had 
 attended. A follow up meeting had been arranged for Friday 12th and the Parish 
 Councillors will return to give their support and encouragement to the fledging 
 group.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2639 – <b>Thames Water at Upper Up.</b> Cllr Stuart 
 had contacted Chris Graham from Moore Allen and Innocent, our agents but he had 
 nothing new to report although he expected to be able to update the Parish 
 Council at the meeting on Wednesday. Cllr Stuart had nothing further to report 
 at the Parish Council meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CerneyWick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the playground was all in order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge made the report. Tyre marks on the grass 
 in front of the Senior Swings had been noted. Cllr Harris had asked the 
 Cotswold Water Park team to reinstate the area. The floor of the Train Unit was 
 in a poor state of repair and needed to be monitored. Cllr Stuart will meet on 
 site with Cllr Harris and possibly Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge to 
 further assess what action may be necessary. Otherwise the equipment was in 
 good order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart made the report. Generally the playing fields are in good order. 
 The Junior Swing, Senior Swing, Slide and Activity Area have been rarely used. 
 The Cycle Mounds were well used over the period. Moles are a severe problem and 
 action is needed to repel the animals. The Clerk had contacted a pest control 
 company which had been effective in the past but was reluctant to supply traps 
 as previously they had been stolen. Nevertheless the company was willing to set 
 six traps at a cost of £250 plus VAT to try and remove the moles. Cllr Stuart 
 had sourced another contractor in the meantime who was prepared to set traps at 
 a more competitive rate. The Parish Council was in favour of employing this 
 latest contact and Cllr Stuart will inform him. Cllr Stuart apologised for not 
 reporting the damage and removal of the picnic table. It was agreed that R.O.W. 
 Berry be asked to rebuild the table. Currently the bits were stored in the 
 cricket pavilion and the rest at Rose Cottage.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Three recommendations were proposed by the Committee: 1. 
 £700 contribution to support Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd as match funding 
 towards the replacement of stiles with kissing gates; 2. that James Harris 
 Contracting is paid; 3. that Philip Dickenson is paid. The Clerk will notify 
 the Finance Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas reported that some of the tree supports on 
 Jubilee Gardens communal area were broken. Cllr Harris did not think that they 
 needed replacing as they trees were now established. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Chairman of the Committee Cllr 
 Caunce for instructions to carry out the annual tree inspection. Cllr Caunce 
 complied. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to inform CDC that the street 
 sign for “Broadway Lane” needed to be replaced by the corner cottage at the War 
 Memorial. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris noted that two stones at the War Memorial had 
 been displaced and needed to be reinstated. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Parish Council appoint 
 John Hicks and Associates to carry out the annual safety checks of the Parish 
 Council playing fields. The Parish Council was in agreement. P</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Note was taken of an advertisement received from Marshalls 
 providers of Grassguard, a permeable grass grid suitable for parking areas. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.27pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON 
 MONDAY 8TH FEBRUARY 2010</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and 
 Cllr Webb attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay opened the meeting at 8.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matter Arising</b> <br>
 Page 2636 – <b>Communication Proposal.</b> As there were no arrangements set up 
 for the posting on notice boards of the agenda, notice of meeting or planning 
 information in the event of either Cllr Caunce or Cllr Stuart being unable to 
 carry out the duty Cllr Nicholas volunteered to deputise in the event Cllr 
 Stuart was otherwise engaged. Cllr Jay reiterated that if Parish Councillors 
 produced proof of purchase of ink cartridges the cost would be reimbursed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spreadsheet Analysis</b> <br>
 With two periods left to be completed, the expenditure detailed on the spread 
 sheet was within budget. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields 
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> <br>
 Three recommendations had been proposed by the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee: 1. £700 contribution to support Cotswold Water Park 
 Society Ltd as match funding towards the replacement of stiles with kissing 
 gates; 2. that James Harris Contracting is paid; 3. that Philip Dickenson is 
 paid. It was agreed by the Committee that a contribution of £700 would be made 
 to the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd but only on completion of the project. 
 The Finance Committee was in agreement on the other two recommendations.</p>

 safety surfaces of the play equipment. The storage facility will be for the

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to inform Tiina Emsley, Principal Planning Policy Officer 
 at CDC that the Parish Council was disappointed that so little notice had been 
 taken of the previous return made for the retail survey section of the Local 
 Development Framework. The Clerk was to ask Ms Emsley to refer back to the 
 previous results. Cllr Nicholas had sourced an amended version of the South 
 Cerney Settlement Profile which he asked the Clerk to make available to the 
 Forward Planning team at CDC. There being no further business Cllr Jay had 
 closed the meeting at 9pm.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas noted that the item of correspondence from 
 Tiina Emsley, Principal Planning Policy Officer at CDC regarding the return 
 requested for the retail survey section of the Local Development Framework 
 should have been processed by the Planning Committee and not the Finance 
 Committee.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9.15pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ALLOTMENTS AT UPPER UP</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart had emailed members of the Parish Council a 
 brief report on the meeting of potential allotment holders held in the Village 
 Hall. A top class get together of people interested in having an allotment at 
 Upper Up in South Cerney had their inaugural meeting on Friday 5th February. 
 Some came as individuals but several as couples or in small groups wanting to 
 share a plot; some were experienced gardeners whilst others were utter 
 beginners. Ages ranged from fifteen to over seventy.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Some members of the Parish Council (PC) which own the 
 land, started the meeting. It was explained that as there appeared to be a 
 demand for plots and as the owners of the old allotments at Hill Orchard were 
 not prepared re-open them, it had been agreed that if we obtained actual proof 
 of sufficient demand from people who were prepared to not only take plots but 
 to get involved in a self managed scheme, the land at Upper Up could be 
 released.&nbsp; Of course, there is the question of Planning Approval but we 
 are already in discussion with the CDC regarding this and PC is optimistic that 
 approval will be obtained. Application, if needed, could be made by the PC, 
 assisted by the new members. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was explained that the new group would need to be 
 involved in all aspects of setting up the project but that members of PC were 
 prepared to assist and advise where required. For example, security fencing 
 will be a must and will cost quite a lot of money. In next year’s financial 
 budget (precept) the PC has set aside a sum towards such costs but the new 
 group will need to look for much of the funding from other sources. The PC has 
 contacts with several groups from which advice on funding can be obtained and 
 also where such things as draft constitutions and tenancy documents can be 
 sourced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Although the group will be responsible for final 
 decisions, the PC has worked on the premise that some 21 plots, each of approx 
 70-80 sq metres, could be set out on the site. That is about a quarter size of 
 the traditional 350 sq metre allotment but would still provide a useful garden 
 area. Sheds were discussed, as was the access for deliveries of manure etc. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Rents and other financial commitments were asked about and 
 it was stated that the PC would treat the allotments in the same way as they do 
 the Tennis, Cricket and Football clubs, namely no annual rent payable to the PC 
 but it was recommended that an annual fee of perhaps £10 was paid by individual 
 allotment holders to their own funds to run the group and to provide communal 
 equipment etc. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The workings of the Composting Club were explained and 
 that members of the new group were the potential recipients of the compost 
 produced but they would be expected to become involved in the working of the 
 composting scheme. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">News about the gift of the “community rotavator” from Sri 
 Lanka was also given. This brand new machine has been donated by a friend with 
 whom the South Cerney Sri Lanka Community Support Fund works on many projects 
 on the island. The 8-horse power machine will be available to all allotment 
 holders and there is someone who is prepared to do the actual work but will 
 need payment.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After explaining what was available and what was required 
 it was suggested that perhaps the assembled group should discuss amongst itself 
 how it wanted to progress without PC members present. It was also agreed that 
 all should meet again on Friday 12th February at 7.30pm in the Village Hall. PC 
 members then left the room with Cllr Stuart returning some 30 minutes later to 
 wind up the meeting and to answer any questions. It seems that it had been a 
 good, productive discussion and everyone seemed to leave in a very optimistic 
 mood. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported to the Parish Council that he had 
 received an email from Graham Ross from GPFA that there was money available 
 through application from the Lottery Fund. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had been in contact with Ben Bendall, CDC 
 Planning Officer who stated that a planning application would be necessary to 
 secure a change of use under CDC Policy 33. Cllr Nicholas volunteered to 
 process the application. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr 
 Harris that Cllr Nicholas be charged to make an application to CDC for the 
 change of use of part of the Upper Up playing fields. The Parish Council was 
 all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>QUESTIONS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF COTSWOLD WATER PARK</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Concern was raised that the employment of the excellent 
 staff at the Cotswold Water Park Society Ltd should continue as their helpful 
 interaction with the local communities was very much appreciated. Parish 
 Councillors agreed with Cllr Nicholas who suggested that our representatives at 
 Cotswold District and Gloucestershire County councils should be encouraged to 
 attend the meeting on March 5th at Somerford Keynes Parish Hall which will 
 consider if the Cotswold Water Park Society is fit for purpose. The Clerk was 
 asked to write to District Councillors C. Bennett, E. Jenkins and P. Messenger, 
 County Councillor S. Parsons and the Chief Executive Officer of Cotswold 
 District Council Mr Neudegg to ask that they attend the meeting as the Parish 
 Council, in the light of revelations from District Councillor Esmond Jenkins, 
 considers the situation most serious.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REVIEW OF VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk confirmed that Chris Cowcher, Rural Adviser at 
 GRCC had agreed to help the Parish Council to review and refresh its Parish 
 Plan. The plan currently being developed at GRCC is an 8 step process with 
 templates that can be used throughout the process. The whole focus for doing 
 such a piece of work is to celebrate the achievements of the previous plan and 
 ensure that the community is given opportunity to input into a new one. Mr 
 Cowcher will attend a meeting with Parish Councillors prior to the commencement 
 of the April Parish Council meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PROMULGATION OF PARISH NOTICES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas had volunteered to deputise for Cllr Stuart 
 in his absence and post the relevant notices on the notice board in Clarks Hay. 
 Cllr Mrs Chapman agreed to act similarly for Cllr Caunce when he was absent. 
 Cllr Jay offered to copy the documents and make arrangements to deliver or for 
 Cllr Mrs Chapman to collect them from the Post Office.</p>

     cessation of the use of Lodge 12, Isis Lakes, Spine Road, South Cerney 
     other than for holiday accommodation. Response deadline 4th February 
     (e-mailed to Parish Councillors) Cllr Nicholas stated that the 
     correspondence notifying the Parish Council of forthcoming appeals by 
     owners of holiday homes was a question of facts. There was no need for the 
     Parish Council to offer its support to the District Council in such 
     circumstances but if any Parish Councillor was aware of an abuse of the 
     conditions of occupancy by any of the appellants notice should be forwarded 
     to the Enforcement Officer at CDC. Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to enquire 
     from CDC if any result had been forthcoming from any survey or monitoring 
     exercise carried out by the Enforcement Officer. Cllr Caunce told him that 
     his experience on a visit to a client in a recent snowy period was that 
     there were no signs of any footprints in or around any of the adjacent 
     properties. Nevertheless Cllr Harris persisted stating the result of any 
     monitoring exercise would be valuable. </td>
