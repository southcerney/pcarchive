    <td>The meeting began at 7pm with Vice Chairman Cllr Squire welcoming Ms Laura Oakley from
    GRCC. Ms Oakley gave a short history of the GRCC explaining that it had been an
    independent charity for 80 years working with many diverse types of groups within
    Gloucestershire. Her job was to encourage development within communities piloting projects
    from bodies like Town and Parish Councils to School and Pre-School groups. Her experience
    in applying for grants from various organisations could be a very valuable asset in
    dealing with funding arrangements. Ms Oakley said that in applying for money most
    organisations insisted that the local community is in favour and involved with any scheme.
    She suggested that as a pre-cursor to making any application the Parish Council might
    consider a review and update to its Village Appraisal and volunteered to help with this
    project. The creation of a Parish Plan was another useful tool in persuading grant
    organisations to fund a project and from that an Action Plan could be developed. Ms Oakley
    would forward templates of Parish Plans/Action Plans to the Clerk. The Vice Chairman
    thanked Ms Oakley for the time she had spent and she left the meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Vice Chairman Cllr Squire opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Stuart, Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Parsons (GCC).<br>

    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Minutes after
    alteration were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the
    Vice Chairman Cllr Squire signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <strong>Kingfisher Place Easement</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on a meeting he had on 13 November in the Village Hall with
    representatives from Redcliffe Homes, Watermark, a resident of Kingfisher Place and the
    Clerk. Redcliffe Homes and Watermark resolved outstanding differences regarding the
    Easement but it was considered that Gloucestershire County Council was obstructive in its
    interpretation of the Easement regarding the water draining into the lake. Ham Lane<br>
    Cllr Squire would supply the developer's name of the relevant part of Sudeley Drive to
    Cllr Nicholas in order that he might obtain a plan so that he could enquire if the land
    was registered. Pedestrian Crossings<br>
    Cllr Nicholas acknowledged receipt of a Local Transport Note 1/95 on pedestrian crossings
    but asked the Clerk to obtain document Local Transport Note 2/95 which should give further
    technical information.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    On Thursday 13 November I attended a meeting in the Village Hall with Cllr Nicholas, Cllr
    Parsons (GCC), Ray Jenkins (Watermark), Richard Corke (Kingfisher Place resident) and Tom
    O'Connor (Redcliffe Homes) to discuss how best to proceed with the adoption of Kingfisher
    Place. From the debate Cllr Nicholas would send a copy of the Land Registry Title to Cllr
    Parsons which would clarify that surface water could drain into Lake 16 and not as the
    County Council thought on to the shoreline of Lake 16. Mr Jenkins and Mr O'Connor agreed
    to sign a new Easement. On receipt of the signed Easement Cllr Parsons would try to
    convince GCC to drop its objections and arrange for the adoption to go ahead.<br>
    On Thursday 20 November I attended a meeting with Cllr Stuart of the Market Towns
    Healthcheck at Cirencester College. This is a progressive exercise to determine what can
    or can't be achieved in the improvement of Cirencester and its hinterland. Proposals and
    ideas will be continually refined until a workable goal is decided. By performing the
    exercise to the satisfaction of the Countryside Agency grant funding from organisations,
    for example, the Rural Development Authority would be more accessible.<br>
    During November I logged 72 3/4 hours which averaged just over 18 hours per week based on
    the 20 working days available. This is exactly what my revised contract allows for.<br>
    On 5 December I attended a meeting of the county branch of the SLCC in Brickworth, near
    Gloucester. Richard Bellis of the GAPTC gave a very interesting talk on Quality Councils
    and pointed some of the inconsistencies in meeting the criteria.<br>
    On 7 December I met with Cllr Squire and Mr Simon King to analyse the returned tenders on
    the Robert Franklin Way play area project. It was decided to recommend that the Parish
    Council agrees to contract Macventure Play Co for most of the refurbishment excepting the
    fencing work which should go to A &amp; B Fencing and the supply and erection of the Hags
    unit which was awarded to Gordon Cornelius. The Clerk was to try and negotiate a small
    reduction in the price quoted by Macventure Play Co for some items that seemed to be
    excessive in comparison. Those contractors not successful in the tender process will be
    notified.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields
    Committee that had met on 8 December.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HGV Signs on Spine Road</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported to Gillian Portlock (Divisional Supervisor GCC Highways) that the over
    growing bushes needed to be cut back from the road signs near Lake 11 on the Spine Road.<br>
    <strong>Churchyard Wall Extension</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that as the archaeological dig, which cost £1,015, was now complete
    the CDC had withdrawn its objections and granted planning permission for the construction
    of the graveyard wall extension.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Planting</strong><br>
    The Committee will hold a separate meeting, prior to next month's Parish Council meeting,
    to discuss a planting plan for Upper Up and to draw up its budget proposals for the coming
    year.<br>
    <strong>Disabled Parking at Village Hall</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart had requested that a letter be sent to the Cirencester Access Group pointing
    out that as the roadway is the property of GCC Highways it is not in the gift of the
    Parish Council to allocate disabled parking areas. The Parish Council had unanimously
    agreed that it would be unfair to residents in School Lane, users of the Village Hall and
    other disabled drivers to provide a designated disabled parking space notwithstanding the
    difficulty of policing such a space. As recorded in previous Minutes if vehicles respected
    the Keep Clear area in front of the hall that space could be properly used as a pick
    up/set down point. The Clerk was instructed to write to the CAG.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart had reported that the safety tiles needed to be refitted. The Clerk brought to
    his attention a quotation from Macventure Play Co for their repair. Cllr Stuart and Cllr
    Harris were sceptical that the proposed repair would work and asked the Clerk to arrange
    for Steve Griffiths from Macventure Play Co contact one or other Councillors to discuss
    the problem. The water on the lower surfaces of the mound is increasing in volume and Cllr
    Harris and Cllr Stuart agreed to meet on site to see if a solution to the problem could be
    found. Cllr Stuart reported that the car park surface had some minor potholes but nothing
    too serious and commented that as the new pavement was nearly complete, action should be
    considered to provide disabled parking bays and access in the car park. The top rails on
    the Junior and Senior Swings had been replaced although he noticed that the seats on the
    Junior Swing had cracks. A letter from RoSPA sincerely apologising for the standard of its
    inspection had been received. The Committee recommends that the Parish Council accepts the
    second option RoSPA suggested to help rectify the situation, which was to refund the fee
    charged for the inspection of the three play areas. It was proposed by Cllr Smith and
    seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council accepts the refund of £177 plus VAT. The
    Parish Council was all in favour. Overall the area was generally tidy and the litter
    collection shows improvement on each inspection.<br>
    <strong>Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    Mrs Chapman report stated that the fence had not yet been repaired and she would contact
    the Cerney Wick Village Committee.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the play bark was full. The wooden framework for the play tiles
    was damaged but not an urgent or dangerous problem. The slide was very muddy. The turf
    sods which had been dug out had been replaced. The barrier to the north of the play area
    (on old railway line) had still not been replaced.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>TREE SURVEY &amp; GENERAL MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had declared a prejudicial interest and left the Committee meeting. Vice
    Chairman Cllr Squire dealt with the following items.<br>
    <strong>Silver Street &amp; The Piece</strong><br>
    The remainder of the Committee had discussed the tenders which had been received and
    recommended to the Finance Committee that James Harris Contracting be asked to complete
    the work on the Piece, according to the tender instructions, for £235 and similarly other
    tree work throughout the village quoted at £450 which included an optional maintenance
    agreement costed at £60.<br>
    <strong>Play Area at Upper Up</strong><br>
    The Committee further recommended that the Finance Committee accepts a quotation from Lee
    Ponting for £95 to remove the overgrowing grass that surrounds all the play areas at
    Upper Up as it was the most competitive quotation received.<br>
    <strong>Concrete Posts in Silver Street</strong><br>
    Although two quotations had been received to remove a concrete post in Silver Street one
    contractor pointed out that there were in fact two posts ­ one on either side of the
    road. The Clerk was asked to contact the suppliers to re-quote using the revised
    specification.<br>
    Cllr Harris had then rejoined the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>COUNCILLORS REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that an offer of a grant for £10,765.89 or 34.99% of the overall
    cost whichever is the lower had been made by the Executive Committee at CDC for Phase One
    Refurbishment of Robert Franklin Way playing field. The Sub-Committee had met and selected
    three suppliers for the work. Cllr Squire volunteered to compose an article for Cerney
    News to notify and encourage residents to purchase an individual tree to be planted at
    Upper Up in commemoration of people and/or occasions.<br>
    The Clerk confirmed that a request by Cllr Harris to report that the &quot;Give Way&quot;
    marking at west of the War Memorial had been not been repainted had been reported to D.
    Flagg of GCC Highways<br>
    After receiving an irate email from Mrs J. Saunders regarding unauthorised parking on
    publicly owned land in Silver Street, Cllr Stuart had contacted the miscreant. Mr Bateman,
    who had been parking his trade vehicles on the grass verge, agreed to move them.<br>
    After discussions with Mr Mould of Lower Mill, Bow Wow apropos the deterioration of the
    bridleway between Bow Wow Bridge and the Tin Bridge, Cllr Squire asked the Committee to
    recommend that the Finance Committee agree to pay for the hire of a dumper truck to move
    material from its drop off point near Robert Franklin Way play area to the damaged part of
    the bridleway. The Committee had unanimously agreed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay, Chairman of the Finance Committee who had another urgent meeting to attend had
    arranged for the Vice Chairman Cllr Smith to report on the deliberations of the Finance
    Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Invoices to be paid</strong><br>
    Alex Lawrie Factors Ground Maintenance South Cerney (July) £753.11 A threat of court
    action had been received if payment was not forthcoming by 11 November. The Clerk had
    acted as instructed and made an offer of £500 in full and final settlement albeit to date
    no reply had been received.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Payment NOT Received</strong><br>
    CAPS R. Hewer £40.00<br>

    Whitton Associates Professional fees on Upper Up project Phase II £458.25 £1,113.12<br>
    Cllr Jay had inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for November. It was
    proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council agrees to
    make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>SLCC Membership Renewal £72.00</strong><br>
    The Clerk asked that payment is withheld until a satisfactory explanation for the 33%
    increase from £54 in 2003 to £72 in 2004 had been justified. The Parish Council was in
    agreement.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Budget/Precept Meeting</strong><br>
    It is essential that CDC is notified of the required precept for the year commencing 1st
    April 2004 not later than 26th January 2004. The Committee had agreed to meet at the New
    House, on 2nd January 2004 at 8pm to finalise its budget proposals.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cutts Charity</strong><br>
    The Committee recommends that the Parish Council decides to decline the donation offered
    through the Cutts Charity. Cllr Jay had explained that income from the Cutts Charity is
    divided equally between the Church, Parish Council and the poor and if the Parish Council
    refused to accept its portion then the amount given to the poor could be doubled. It was
    proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council declines the
    donation from Cutts Charity. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest and took no part in the debate on the
    following two quotations.<br>
    <strong>Tree work in Silver Street &amp; The Piece</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Smith that the Parish Council agrees
    with a recommendation from the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee that James
    Harris Contracting be asked to complete the work on the Piece, according to the tender
    instructions, for £235 and similarly other tree work throughout the village quoted at
    £450 which included an optional maintenance agreement costed at £60. The Parish Council
    was in favour and Cllr Harris abstained.<br>
    <strong>Play Area at Upper Up</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pollard and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council
    agrees with a recommendation from the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee
    that Lee Ponting be contracted to remove the overgrowing grass that surrounds all the play
    areas at Upper Up for £95. The Parish Council was in favour and Cllr Harris abstained.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>COUNCILLORS REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that as the archaeological dig, which cost £1,015, was now complete
    the CDC had withdrawn its objections and granted planning permission for the construction
    of the graveyard wall extension. It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Mrs
    Chapman that the Parish Council agrees with a recommendation from the Playing Fields and
    Village Maintenance Committee that this payment be made. The Parish Council was in full
    agreement.<br>
    After discussions with Mr Mould of Lower Mill, Bow Wow apropos the deterioration of the
    bridleway between Bow Wow Bridge and the Tin Bridge, Cllr Squire asked that the Parish
    Council agrees to a recommendation from the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee to pay for the hire of a dumper truck to move material from its drop off point
    near Robert Franklin Way play area to the damaged part of the bridleway. Mr Mould had
    arranged 15 volunteers to help spread the material. It was estimated that the cost of
    hiring a dumper truck would not exceed £100. The Clerk informed the Committee that
    payment could be authorised under a Section 137 arrangement. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs
    Pollard and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council agrees to pay up to a maximum
    of £100 for the dumper hire.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Squire reported that an offer of a grant for £10,765.89 or 34.99% of the overall
    cost whichever is the lower had been made by the Executive Committee at CDC for Phase One
    Refurbishment of Robert Franklin Way playing field. The Sub-Committee had met and selected
    three suppliers for the work. Since the grant had been made the Clerk had negotiated a
    small discount from Macventure Play Co of £424. The total cost to complete the works now
    amounted to £30,656 which after taking the grant into account left approximately £20,000
    to be financed by the Parish Council. The Clerk informed the meeting that there was
    £21,585 in the budget for this project. Cllr Squire proposed and Cllr Nicholas seconded a
    motion to approve A&amp;B Fencing for Fencing and Gates, Gordon Cornelius for the supply
    and erection of the Hags unit and Macventure Play Co for the remainder of the contract.<br>
    The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Nicholas suggested that the future strategy of applying for funding becomes more
    proactive by checking out what funds are available and then deciding on a Parish Council
    project which would be eligible. He specifically referred to two GRCC grants currently
    available for village projects.<br>
    Cllr Webb quoted from an article on how Quality Councils would be more likely to be
    successful in sourcing grant funding than those which were not accredited. The Clerk was
    asked to find out what it would cost to attain &quot;Quality&quot; status. It was a prime
    requirement that the Clerk was qualified to AQA standard which is estimated to take
    between 30­100 hours to attain. The Clerk explained that this was akin to the Parish
    Council purchasing his leisure time which would he charge at a more competitive rate than
    the hourly rate he was currently paid assuming that he is willing to comply.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 8
    December.<br>
    Cllr Jay joined the meeting at 8.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>CT.7318/D</strong> Mill Cottage, Cerney Wick Deborah Smith CDC Planning Officer
    confirmed that amended plans had been received on 8th December and she would despatch
    copies shortly.<br>
    <strong>CT.8163/D</strong> Orchard House, South Cerney<br>
    This retrospective application is in two parts. The erection of the new gates has been
    registered under UPRN 03/02701/FUL and a CT number will be issued shortly. The application
    for the wall has a designated UPRN 03/02702/FUL but has not been registered as yet because
    the block plan disagrees with the photograph.<br>
    <strong>Focus Group</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on a Focus Group he had attended at CDC entitled Town and Parish
    Councils and Amenity Societies. He noted that: the Local Plan Inquiry would start on 6th
    April and last 2/3 months; plans will be scanned in so all applications will be available
    on-line; any planning application (other than by CDC) can be dealt with by officers but if
    there is any objection then it has to go to Committee or a Ward Councillor also has the
    right to bring any application to the Committee for determination; South West Regional<br>
    Development Agency is funding a master plan for the Cotswold Water Park; hedges are to be
    included in the new Antisocial Behaviour Act which comes into force next autumn.<br>
    Guidance for Town and Parish Councillors on Probity and Planning Cllr Nicholas objected to
    the procedural guidance when a Councillor declares a prejudicial interest issued by the
    District Council's Standards Committee. Under the guidance a Councillor must leave the
    meeting which Cllr Nicholas considered unnecessary if the prejudicial interest was based
    on, for example, knowing a neighbour. He suggested that a vote should be taken by the
    Parish Council or Committee to determine whether a Councillor could continue in
    attendance. Cllr Nicholas agreed when the Clerk suggested that Standing Orders should be
    reviewed to comply with the new regulations. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) stated that the notes
    were for the guidance of all Town and Parish Councils and not specifically written for the
    operation of South Cerney Parish Council.<br>

    The Committee agreed that if this application was granted it would set a precedent for
    further large scale residential development in rural settings in complete contravention of
    sustainability policies. The site would be unsuitable for residential development because
    of the excessive noise from the adjacent dual carriageway.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLORS REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) reported that new car parking charges were being considered for
    Cirencester by the District Council. Cllr Jay responded by asking that some of the extra
    income generated would be useful in creating a more sustainable transport policy. Cllr
    Nicholas agreed and suggested that it would be a good idea if the old railway line between
    South Cerney and Cirencester was developed as a dedicated cycleway. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC)
    said that Council Tax on second homes would be discussed at District level. Cllr Mrs Clark
    mentioned that Mr Paul Hardiman (GCC Transport Projects Officer) would be available at the
    Cotswold Water Park, Somerford Keynes on 12/13 December to discuss rural routes. Cllr
    Caunce asked that Wick Water Lane be included in any future scheme. Cllr Harris asked that
    Wildmoorway Lane is also included. The Clerk would write to Mr Hardiman.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that Pete's Catering establishment was still creating a nuisance
    to other road users. The Clerk replied that the Enforcement Officer had informed him that
    a notice had been issued to the owner of the pit advising that the operation cease.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr Squire closed the meeting at 9.30pm. </td>
