    <p>Cllr Mr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30pm.<br>
    <br>
    Present: Parish Councillors Mrs F. Chapman, J. Harris, P. Jay, Mrs C. 
    Pollard, D. Smith, T. Squire, M. Stuart, R. Webb, Cotswold District 
    Councillors C. Bennett and Mrs A. Clark, Gloucestershire County Councillor

    <br>
    Apologies were received from Parish Councillors Mrs E. Chubb, J Caunce and 
    P. Nicholas and Mr B. Clifford (Chairman School Governors)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING</b><br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that the 
    minutes as published were a true record. The meeting was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CHAIRMAN’S REPORT</b><br>
    <br>
    2004 Parish Council Chairman's report<br>
    <br>
    It is not until I sat down to prepare this report that I realised just how 
    much this Parish Council has achieved over the past year. In fact, not only 
    have we achieved so much in this year just gone by but also it should be 
    recorded that virtually all the items on the “wish list” in the 1999 Village 
    Appraisal have been achieved. That is no mean feat and I am pretty darned 
    pleased to say the least.<br>
    <br>
    Your Parish Council comprises of some 11 members, six of whom joined us last 
    May. I was somewhat worried as to how the new set up would work especially 
    as I had taken over as Chairman for the first time. As it has worked out, I 
    shouldn’t have worried. The team has got together superbly and it has been a 
    pleasure to be part of that team. Everyone has put in as much time as they 
    could not only at routine meetings but to deal with all sorts of problems in 
    the Parish. I feel that these days people are more inclined to ask Parish 
    Councillors for advice and help more than they did a few years ago. I hope 
    that is so.<br>
    <br>
    Council has three committees: Planning, Finance and Playing 
    Fields/Maintenance.<br>
    <br>
    Planning has considered numerous planning applications but thankfully has 
    not had any major controversial projects to debate as we have had in 
    previous years. That is not to say that they have had it easy, oh no. We 
    have the unrelenting march of the timber holiday lodges with the associated 
    problems of tree felling and so on, the plans for the massive new hotel on 
    the Spine Road and the new industrial park in Broadway Lane. Our hope is 
    that the Cotswold District Council will at times listen to our objections 
    and our constructive suggestions. Unfortunately our feeling is that the CDC 
    Planning Committee only take notice of our views when may agree with them. 
    We have had several pretty heated discussions with our District Councillors 
    on this subject but I must say that I personally believe that of all the 
    three Committees we have, Planning is the least effective through no fault 
    of their own. Local concerns and points of view should have more effect on 
    District Council decisions. Central Government rabbit on and on about the 
    need for more input by more people but this does not seem to be heard by 
    local district councils.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks to the Planning Committee for all their hard work.<br>
    <br>
    Maintenance and Playing Field Committee has been very active this past year. 
    I am delighted to report that so much has been achieved that I haven’t time 
    to detail everything. The main projects have been the Robert Franklin Way 
    play area and the Upper Up mountain bike track. Both projects were a long 
    time in the planning and financing stages but to see so many youngsters 
    using both areas has made the wait well worthwhile. The cost of these two 
    projects totalled in excess of £50,000 but would have been beyond our reach 
    if the RFW equipment had not been donated by two separate sources and also 
    if Cllr James Harris hadn’t done the construction work at Upper Up at a 
    fraction of what other contractors had quoted. Great thanks to James for 
    that and for the numerous other things he does for this village. Thanks also 
    to Cllr Philip Nicholas and to Mr Simon King for the excellent work they did 
    in conjunction with other parents in the planning and financing of the RFW 
    scheme. The Glos Playing Field association supplied one lot of playground 
    equipment and Ms Linda Lloyd of Le Spa, who so happens to live in the 
    village, supplied the rest. Thanks to both for their generosity.<br>
    <br>
    Other projects in the pipeline include the improvement of the public 
    footpath between the end of Church Lane and Bow Wow. We are working with our 
    friends in SCROWS and with Lady Fanshaw, the owner of the land. This is part 
    of the nationwide scheme brought in by Westminster in the Countryside Rights 
    of Way Act 2000. Under the provisions of that Act, all authorities 
    responsible for Public Rights of Way, footpaths to you and me, must attempt 
    to improve as many footpaths as possible to such a standard as to permit 
    people in wheel chairs, parents with buggies etc and disabled people, say 
    with walking difficulties, to use those paths. There is no debate permitted 
    as the law insists and I for one welcome it. We have also started 
    discussions with GCC PROW to attempt to connect the pathway across the Upper 
    Up playing field to the newly improved footpath leading to Keynes Park.<br>
    <br>
    Still on footpaths, we have checked with GCC PROW to see when the Public 
    Enquiry about the BSC11 is scheduled. Apparently, it is tenth on the list 
    and that could mean it will take a very long time to be dealt with.<br>
    <br>
    Although we had very little say in it, the resurfacing of High Street to the 
    end of Station Road has improved the village and I do think that this 
    Council’s nagging to anyone we thought had a say did assist in getting it 
    done, especially the last bit at the far end of Station Road.<br>
    <br>
    The Committee and full council have been much involved in the enlargement of 
    the Churchyard. It is required by law that Parish Councils must provide land 
    to bury their dead. We were again so very fortunate when Lady Fanshaw 
    donated part of the grounds of Chapter Manor to the Parochial Church Council 
    for that purpose. Parish Council have paid for the building of the Cotswold 
    stonewall to enclose that land and a wonderful job has been done by the 
    craftsman. If you haven’t seen it yet, do go and have a look.<br>
    <br>
    Two other main jobs carried out by the Maintenance Committee are the 
    supervision of the grass cutting around the village and the weekly 
    inspections of the playground equipment. Unglamorous, tedious, thankless but 
    needed!<br>
    <br>
    That leaves the Finance Committee, and what would we do without them? It is 
    a balancing act to get the money situation just so. To raise the required 
    funds to keep our village going and to carry out the improvements and while 
    doing so to keep the increase in our annual precept to an acceptable level 
    is not easy but I suggest that this is done and done well. The total village 
    precept for 2004-05, £51,065. This means that a D band dwelling pays 
    £38.50pa towards village funding. That is an increase on last year’s total 
    of £5.59pa or about 47p per month. I suggest we all get darned good value 
    from these payments.<br>
    <br>
    Some item that we all thought would attract a lot of comment and did not, 
    was when we voted to take up the newly allowed financial allowances for 
    Parish Councillors. Council voted for these to be available but it will be 
    up to the individual Councillor to decide if they will take the money or 
    not.<br>
    <br>
    Parish Council meetings rarely finish before 10pm any and every month and 
    all your representatives put in a lot more time than the hours spent at 
    those meetings. Why? Probably because we have a great affection for this 
    village and because we enjoy doing it.<br>
    <br>
    Some other people who really must enjoy public service are our District and 
    County Councillors. Cllrs Ann Clark &amp; Clive Bennett attend almost all our 
    meetings. County Councillor Shaun Parsons attends as and when necessary. 
    Some do stay longer than others but again they have many other villages to 
    visit every month and I take this opportunity to thank them all for their 
    assistance over the year.<br>
    <br>
    It is always good to be able to say thank you to people and I have already 
    thanked several tonight but I must also say a very special thanks to our 
    parish Clerk Maurice McKee. Last year this man gave not only himself a 
    severe fright by having a heart attack just a couple of hours before the 
    start of the Annual meeting but he very nearly caused me to have one as well 
    because I came to that meeting not knowing if he would recover! Recover he 
    did I’m so glad to say and he was back in harness far too soon to please his 
    doctors but you can’t keep a good man down. As always, Maurice has been a 
    tower of strength to this Council. He keeps up to speed on a myriad of new 
    legislation rules regulations and procedures. His minute taking and 
    recording are top class and he keeps us all on the straight and narrow at 
    meetings. We are indeed fortunate to have this man as our Clerk. Thank you 
    Maurice for all your efforts.<br>
    <br>
    Well, that’s about it. I am sorry that I have gone on so long but you should 
    have seen my notes before I edited them! Thanks to every one for coming 
    tonight.<br>
    <br>

    <p>As an INA we are pleased with the overall figures for the Parish of South 
    Cerney, particularly in relation to violent offences (86% of which were 
    detected), and in relation to nuisance offences such as criminal damage 
    which have seen a significant fall. Burglary Dwellings have risen but 12 of 
    the 23 offences relate to two locations.<br>
    <br>
    More crimes have been detected this year. Of all crimes in 2002/2003 18% 
    were detected, in 2003/2004 this had risen to over 32%.<br>
    <br>
    There have been many changes in policing over the past twelve months 
    including the introduction of PCSO’s. They are settled in now and are a 
    great asset to the police force. They carry out enquiries and high 
    visibility foot patrols to provide reassurance and support.<br>
    <br>
    <b>QUESTIONS</b><br>
    <br>
    1. Cllr Stuart enquired how many people were involved in crime. Sgt 
    Templeton replied that it was a national statistic that 10% of the people 
    commit 60% of all crime.<br>
    <br>
    2. Cllr Jay remarked that now 90% of Council Tax was being collected from 
    second homes in the area these properties were no longer a drain on 
    services. Cllr Bennett (CDC) pointed out that the tax collected was on 
    behalf of central government and not directly by local government. Sgt 
    Templeton commenting on the rise in burglaries of non dwellings pointed out 
    that these were primarily committed during the construction stage.<br>
    <br>
    3. Cllr Harris said that the mobile police station provided a contact for 
    local people to have access to police and generally it was well received. He 
    asked whether policing was pro-active or re-active to which Sgt Templeton 
    replied that it was mostly re-active but patrols were available if and when 
    time allowed. Currently there were more police in Gloucestershire than ever 
    before although more were now used on clerical duties.<br>
    <br>
    On completion of questions Sgt Templeton and PC Ransford left the meeting to 
    return to duty.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM MAJOR IAN BRUCE, 29 REGT RLC</b><br>
    <br>
    Major Bruce reported that regiment personnel from the South Cerney barracks 
    were now serving in Iraq and the Balkans. In the past year the regiment had 
    handled 150,000 metric tons of material and more than 21,000 people had used 
    the camp as a transit stop on their way to other theatres. He was proud to 
    report that one female soldier will hopefully join the Olympic squad. On 11 
    July there will be an open day at the Duke of Gloucester Barracks and 
    everyone is welcome to attend. Major Bruce was pleased to report that the 
    Silver Stars now have a new and quieter plane for making parachute descents.<br>
    <br>
    <b>QUESTION</b><br>
    <br>
    1. Cllr Stuart enquired if there were more or less complaints since the 
    introduction of the new plane. Major Bruce replied that there were more 
    complaints from the Skyvan but this is a military aircraft and pleasingly 
    complaints about the new plane had dropped off dramatically. Cllr Stuart 
    advised Major Bruce to check the South Cerney Parish Council website 
    regarding complaints especially from Coln Rogers.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CLLR MRS ANNE CLARK (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    This year I have served on the Executive Committee as well as the Planning 
    Committee. Due to the increased speed of determining planning applications, 
    the Government awarded an increased delivery grant of over £358,000. Over 
    3,000 applications were dealt with last year and it could be nearer 3,500 
    this year. Two major applications are due to start work soon, one the 
    Leisure Centre on the Cattle Market site and the construction of the new 
    cattle market off the Spine Road roundabout.<br>
    <br>
    The new Information Centre run by the Cotswold Water Park Society on the 
    Spine Road has now been opened, and is worth a visit, also to the 
    Restaurant. The Cycle Path along the Spine Road will be fully completed in 
    due course. Part of this will be carried out after the planning application 
    for the new hotel has been determined.<br>
    <br>
    The Council is now run on the Cabinet System with 9 members of the 
    Conservative group being Portfolio holders, responsible for their particular 
    part of the running of the Council. The Planning Committee will remain the 
    same, and I will hand over to Clive Bennett who will report more fully on 
    the Licensing Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT FROM CLLR CLIVE BENNETT (CDC)</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Bennett informed the meeting that he was now Chairman of the Licensing 
    Committee at Cotswold District Council. Reorganisation of the granting of 
    licences meant that magistrates would no longer control this function. 
    Individual licences would be granted for a 10 year period to premises being 
    reviewed on a rolling scale every 3 years. Cllr Bennett quoted examples of 
    types of businesses which would require licences including those selling 
    alcohol, hot dog sellers, taxis and ice cream salesmen.<br>
    <br>
    New collection points for recycling, especially plastics, were being made 
    available from June 4th at Tesco (Kingsmeadow) and the Royal Agricultural 
    College.<br>
    <br>
    <b>QUESTIONS</b><br>
    <br>
    1. Cllr Smith asked if plastic for recycling would be available at the 
    kerbside.<br>
    Cllr Bennett was not sure.<br>
    <br>
    2. Major Bruce enquired who would manage the disposal of the plastic which 
    he considered would be a considerable volume.<br>
    Cllr Bennett said that the District Council would be responsible for its 
    collection and Gloucestershire County Council would dispose of it.<br>
    <br>
    3. Cllr Jay pointed out to Cllr Bennett that there were considerable numbers 
    of complaints over the introduction of the new car parking charges in 
    Cirencester exacerbated by the insensitive promotion on the back of the car 
    park ticket of cheaper parking for shoppers in Swindon.<br>
    Cllr Bennett defended the increase in charges pointing out that it was very 
    good value for money especially if one was to purchase tickets on long term 
    plans prior to their use.<br>
    Cllr Jay agreed that it was a cheaper way that to pay on the day but not 
    everybody could afford to spend £250 in advance for parking fees.<br>
    <br>
    4. Cllr Stuart complained to Cllr Mrs Clark about the numbers of 
    retrospective planning applications now being submitted.<br>
    Cllr Mrs Clark was aware that this type of application was proliferating but 
    admitted the procedure was within the legal framework although dangerous for 
    the applicant especially if an application was refused permission.<br>
    <br>
    5. Cllr Jay expressed his discontent with the procedure of applying for a 
    Public Entertainment Licence. For example he said, the Village Hall had to 
    apply every year for a licence which could take up to 6 months to grant. 
    Venues were required to carry out safety inspections but these were required 
    all at the same time and really should be staggered.<br>
    Cllr Bennett assured Cllr Jay that new rules will be in force in the future 
    to avoid this.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>REPORT BY COUNCILLOR SHAUN PARSONS (GCC)</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr Parsons informed the meeting that the County Council had introduced 
    Cabinet System of control. Currently it was dominated by a Labour/Liberal 
    coalition. Unfortunately there is no representation in Cabinet from the 
    Cotswold District Council area which will inevitably mean an urban bias 
    vis-á-vis a rural one. Council tax increased by 5.7% with an increase in 
    staffing levels by 800 to a total of 9,352. The Tri-Service Centre at 
    Quedgeley was working well but under threat of closure from central 
    government. In the School Review program, Conservatives were not happy with 
    the loss of 6th Form education, especially in Tetbury and in the Primary 
    School Review, where a school has less than 100 it will be under a closure 
    threat. He emphasised on mineral extraction, planning needs to be better 
    policed with more feed back to District and Parish Councils. He reported 
    that the Landscape Review of the Water Park was ongoing. Conservatives in 
    the County Council were pushing for an increase in spending on road 
    maintenance, doubling expenditure if possible. The adoption of Kingfisher 
    Place in South Cerney was proceeding, albeit slowly. Engrossment was in 
    process and all fees had now been paid.<br>
    <br>
    Cllr Stuart thanked Cllr Parsons for his effort in ensuring the resurfacing 
    of High Street and Station Road. Cllr Parsons was asked what progress could 
    be expected on the Cycle Path from Cirencester Road to Cerney Wick which was 
    part of the Sustrans route. Cllr Bennett interjected that land owners, 
    Bathurst Estates and Richard Knight were currently disinclined to commit 
    their land to this useful route. Cllr Stuart asked all three Councillors 
    (Parsons, Bennett and Mrs Clark) to try harder to create this cycle path.<br>

    <b>REPORT BY CLLR TONY SQUIRE ON BEHALF OF THE VICAR, REV J CALVERT</b><br>
    <br>
    As there had not been an apology received from Rev J. Calvert, Church Warden 
    and Parish Councillor T. Squire thanked the Parish Council for its 
    contribution to the churchyard wall extension which was now complete.<br>

    <b>REPORT ON ANN EDWARDS SCHOOL, WRITTEN BY STEPHEN RICHARDSON, HEADTEACHER 
    AND READ BY MR ROGER EDGAR ON BEHALF OF MR B. CLIFFORD, CHAIRMAN OF SCHOOL 
    GOVERNORS</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Personnel</b><br>
    Before I started at the school in September I was involved in interviews to 
    replace two established members of staff. Pam Nelmes and Tamsin Wallis. We 
    appointed Vicki Mauler and Ben Stirling, an NQT, to our team at KS1. We have 
    also taken on new learning support workers this year, Helen Bennett and 
    Melanie Holling to replace members of staff who have moved on or to work in 
    the school as part of our inclusion funding. Diana Goodinson left the school 
    when the statemented child she was linked to left the village and the 
    funding for her post was lost. We are in the process of appointing a 
    replacement for Ellen Vincent who has been with the school for more years 
    than anyone can remember. The governing body has seen changes also with the 
    appointment of Brian Clifford as chair and Roger Edgar as vice-chair. 
    Currently we have 278 children on roll and it looks as if there will be 
    about 42 children joining us in September.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Curriculum and SATS</b><br>
    Our SATs results for 2003 were very pleasing, with excellent progress being 
    made by children within the school pupils achieving well. The school 
    continues to offer a good quality of education for its pupils and they 
    receive a broad and balanced curriculum. We are a category 1 school within 
    the LEA and our Investors in People status has just been confirmed for the 
    next three years.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other extra curricular school activities</b><br>
    The school offers a full range of after school clubs including for example, 
    football, netball, tag rugby, cricket, rounders, cookery, gardening, 
    Spanish, computer, chess, racquet skills, bug club. These are well attended 
    by the pupils. We have held adult learning courses at the school working 
    with the Family Learning centre and Parentline Plus.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Footsteps – Educating towards a more sustainable future</b><br>
    We have continued our link with the Joel Omino School in Kisumo and we have 
    sponsored them to take part in the Commonwealth Tapestry Project which will 
    result in the tapestries made by both schools being displayed at the Games 
    when they are next held.<br>
    <br>
    <b>D.A.R.E. Project</b><br>
    P.C. John Smith of the MOD police 29th Regiment has again run the drug 
    awareness programme for our Year 6 Pupils. Unfortunately this will be the 
    last year that the course will run in its current format due to the funding 
    being withdrawn.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other projects</b><br>
    Our Year 4 children has been on a trip to the Wijderness Centre again this 
    year. We have had visits from the Lifestyle Education Bus, various theatre 
    groups, Nick Williams the Birdwise man and the children have visited SCOEC 
    for 2 days. Pupils have taken part in the Dance Festival, schools swimming 
    gala and played a number of sporting fixtures against other schools.<br>

    <b>REPORT BY MRS A. STUART, SECRETARY VILLAGE HALL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</b><br>
    <br>
    At the end of the 2002-03 year, we thought that we were in the final throws 
    of the major improvements at our village hall, but these works continued 
    into this year just finished. In fact, they are still on going! It’s a bit 
    like the painting of the Forth Bridge. My big regret is that we still have 
    to get the main Hall decorated but even that being delayed has resulted in 
    our saving a lot of money – money we did not have in any case! We are hoping 
    to have the work done by people on the Punishment in the Community scheme as 
    and when there is a space in our calendar that matches one in theirs. All we 
    pay for will be the cost of materials.<br>
    <br>
    The most obvious change made since last year’s meeting is the removal of the 
    old fixed stage. The extra floor space this released is amazing. So many 
    users have commented on this improvement. The demountable staging is 
    excellent and easy to use, not only by the Players, but also by anyone else 
    who needs it. For example, the two Flower Shows have both utilised the 
    staging as display tables to best advantage. We hope to purchase four more 
    sections in the near future to make up the full size required by the 
    Players.<br>
    <br>
    Our heating system is now fully modernised with new quiet radiators supplied 
    by a new state of the art condensing boiler. What a difference this has made 
    to the comfort of our users this last winter.<br>
    <br>
    Another major improvement to the comfort has been the arrival of fifty new 
    upholstered chairs. Not a cheap exercise but well worth it. It might be 
    coincidence, but since the arrival of these chairs, the numbers of people at 
    the monthly cinema shows has increased quite dramatically.<br>
    <br>
    The Cerney Cinema has had mixed fortunes in the past year but all in all, it 
    is an enjoyable way to spend a Saturday evening and we have made a useful 
    sum towards our funds. A major vote of thanks to Sarah and David Smith for 
    doing so much to organise the events. Not only does Sarah deal with the 
    advertising and the arranging of the events but also she drives many miles 
    to collect the equipment all at no cost to us what so ever. David is the top 
    man when it comes to setting up the equipment. Also, thanks to Hilary 
    Thornton and Tommy Walker for the work they do in setting out the chairs, 
    doing the teas and raffle and clearing up afterwards. A good team effort.<br>
    <br>
    The final function that we organised was the Open Day last Saturday when we 
    celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Brownies in South Cerney, albeit a 
    year late. Whilst not many from the village came along the Brownies were 
    well supported by mums and friends. It turned out to be an excellent 
    afternoon. The hall was buzzing. The Brownies successfully took a number of 
    their badges. Hilary and I had three excellent helpers with the food and 
    drink as they took their hostess badge. Thanks go to all those who came 
    along, Hilary for buying and helping with food and Mike Smith who negotiated 
    what appeared to be a rather wobbly ladder to place the Brownies time 
    capsule in the roof. Fortunately Mike (Chairman Village Hall Management 
    Committee) was weighty enough to counter balance the ladder – he would, also 
    have been a soft landing for Mike Smith!<br>
    <br>
    So all in all a good year – here’s to 2004–2005.<br>
    <br>
    <b>COMMENTS</b><br>
    <br>
    Cllr M. Stuart, Chairman of the Village Hall Management Committee praised 
    the Committee for their commitment to the various projects which they 
    organised and their enthusiasm and dedication to the management of the 
    village hall.<br>
    <br>
    A resident from Kingfisher Place was concerned that trees on the peninsula 
    of Lake 16 may be removed when redevelopment takes place. Cllr Bennett (CDC) 
    assured him that the site manager and Cotswold District Council were aware 
    of the protected trees there and a schedule for their protection was being 
    prepared although some would be removed the majority were to remain.<br>
    <br>
    There being no further business Cllr M. Stuart closed the meeting at 9.45pm.<br>
