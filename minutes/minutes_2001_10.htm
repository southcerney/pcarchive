    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Nicholas that the Minutes as amended
    were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council agreed unanimously and the Minutes
    were signed by the Chairperson Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Village Floods</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on a meeting he had attended at Abberley House, Cirencester on 28
    September to discuss flood preventative measures. Representatives of the concerned
    agencies present included Charles Davis (Thames Water), Chris Blackler (Environment
    Agency), Martyn Summerell (GCC Highways), Steve Cook (Fosseway Housing Association), Cllr
    L. Jones (CDC) and CDC officers. The meeting was chaired by Andrew Grant Director of
    Community Services at CDC. Chris Blackler made the confident prediction that flooding will
    not happen again. A new sluice system at the end of School Lane would move more water to
    the Mill Stream. A feasibility study was in progress and would was expected to begin
    2004­5. Cleveland lakes were to be lowered soon. Charles Davis reported that two flow
    monitors and two anti flooding sewer valves were to be installed in South Cerney. He
    suggested that the floods were due to overland flows and that £250,000 had been earmarked
    for improvement work, including CCTV surveys, in the Cirencester, Siddington and South
    Cerney areas. The hydraulic modelling would be done again. Steve Cook reported that a
    survey had shown some cracks and one collapse in the system. Jetting out the system and
    remedial work was underway. A newsletter, coordinated by CDC, would be published with
    contributions from the agencies and distributed to all residents. Cllr Jones (CDC) added
    that the action taken and planned is a significant step in the right direction. The next
    meeting is scheduled for 18 January 2002.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Residents Association Meeting</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart had attended a meeting on 27 September of the Residents
    Association. Cllr Harris reported that it was a good natured meeting under the
    circumstances. Nick Brown Fosseway Housing Association property maintenance representative
    described the sewerage/drainage system in better condition than at first thought. A CCTV
    survey had detected that there were some cracks and one collapse but work was underway to
    repair the damage. More worrying was a survey of the flats which found that the external
    walls have no foundations. Measures to control sewerage discharge included the temporary
    installation of two anti flooding sewer valves which will shut automatically when flooding
    occurs sending an alarm signal. This will isolate the Berkeley Close system and the pipe
    work will then act as a septic tank which will be pumped out when necessary. Flood water
    will be prevented from entering the system by sealing man holes and other lifting holes.
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner read a Fosseway's reply to the Parish Council's query regarding their
    intentions for land at the rear of Berkeley Close. Fosseway confirmed that they had no
    current plans for development of land outside of their land ownership.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Casual Vacancy</strong><br>
    Notices had been placed informing electors that there was a vacancy on the Parish Council.
    The closing date for electors to request an election was 23 October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Personnel Committee</strong><br>
    In the absence of any other nominations Cllr Nicholas agreed to stand for the vacancy on
    the Personnel Committee. This was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Dunn. The
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which had met on 8
    October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Election of Chairman &amp; Vice Chairman</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas was proposed for Chairman by Cllr Dunn, seconded by Cllr Mrs Pearse and
    approved unanimously by the Committee. Cllr Dunn was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and
    seconded by Cllr Nicholas for Vice Chairman and approved unanimously by the Committee.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Best Value Review</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas had drafted a letter to Kim Cooper at CDC outlining objections to the Best
    Value Review. A copy would be sent to all Parish and Town Councils who had responded to
    the Parish Council's original communication on the matter.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Responding to Applications</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas proposed that the Planning Committee meet two weeks after Parish Council
    meetings to determine those applications which required a response before the Parish
    Council could discuss them. He asked that the Parish Council empower the Planning
    Committee to comment or object on those applications which would be out of time before the
    Parish Council met. If an application was considered contentious then a deferment would be
    requested from CDC and the Clerk would notify Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC). It was proposed by
    Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Mrs Gardiner that the Parish Council accept these new
    arrangements. The Parish Council agreed to this but to review the situation after a trial
    period of three months. Meetings would be held on a Wednesday at 7pm at a venue to be
    decided. The Clerk would provide Cllr Nicholas with the relevant applications on the
    Tuesday prior to the meeting.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    CT.0006/3/E<br>
    Construction of 58 holiday lodges and car park, replacement of sailing club house and
    boat-house (revised scheme) The Committee had agreed to object to this application as the
    new club house, boat park, car park and some of the lodges would be visible from the edge
    of the village and proposed bridle path. Cllr Nicholas asked that this decision be
    ratified as the Committee did not have the benefit of the Parish Council's input due to
    the time restraint imposed. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    OBJECT<br>
    <br>
    CT.1454/3/P<br>
    The construction of a children's tree play house at Horseshoe Lake, Wildmoorway Lane,
    South Cerney No objection provided that a condition be set that the proposed development
    would not be used for sleeping accommodation.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.2003/P<br>
    The raising of the boundary wall and installation of clear glazing into east elevation
    first floor window at land at School Lane, South Cerney Windows of the dwelling would be
    an intrusion to the privacy of those occupying Vine Cottage not withstanding the erection
    of the proposed wall.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4067/2<br>
    Erection of conservatory/sun room to side of dwelling at 27 Sudeley Drive, South Cerney,
    Cirencester. The Committee had agreed not to object to this application. Cllr Nicholas
    asked that this decision be ratified as the Committee did not have the benefit of the
    Parish Council¹s input due to the time restraint imposed. The Parish Council agreed.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4233/E<br>
    Minor amendment to proposed Cricket Pavilion, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.4454/G<br>
    The erection of a side extension at Quarry Farm, Cricklade Road, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION subject to Parish Council approval<br>
    <br>
    CT.4919/C<br>
    Alteration and extension to dwelling at Clover Cottage, School Lane, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8163/B<br>
    Erection of 2 (two) detached two storey dwellings at Orchard House, Upper Up, South Cerney
    The size of the development would be alien to the area. Two very large houses in such
    close proximity to other adjoining dwellings would be detrimental to the overall visual
    amenity of the Conservation Area. Houses of this size would probably have several vehicles
    associated with each of them potentially causing high vehicle movement. Far too many
    mature trees would have to be destroyed.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8173<br>
    Erection of a 10 metre mobile ³telegraph² telecommunications column supporting an omni
    antenna and an equipment cabin positioned adjacent not exceeding 2.5 cubic metres at the
    junction of Station Road/Spine Road, East Spine Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. The
    Parish Council decided not to object to this application provided that it does not
    interfere with the proposed Spine Road cycle path.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    CT.8184<br>
    Two storey extension at 17 Broadway Lane, South Cerney, Cirencester The property is set in
    a row of similar, modest semi-detached houses on one side of the road and the proposed
    development would be inappropriate at this location. The design, and in particular the
    size of the proposed development in relation to the size of the whole site, would have a
    detrimental effect on the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and on the
    surrounding area. The front elevation of the proposed extension would destroy the rhythm
    of a row of regular semi-detached properties, and set an undesirable precedent. A letter
    had been received from a resident objecting to the proposed development.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Gardiner that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee and to ratify the decisions
    taken on applications CT.0006/3/E and CT.4067/2. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning Applications granted by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    CT.1454/3/H<br>
    Relocation of 48 units on previously approved development of 87 holiday lodges at Lake 7

    <br>
    CT.CONTR 1138<br>
    Notification of intention to undertake tree work at Avery Cottage, Silver Street, South
    Cerney Various works as per notification<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>

    Various works as per notification ­ Alder at gate: trim lower branches; Pine: trim sides,
    reduce top; Alder opposite Hillview House: fell and replace with more suitable tree; Ash
    trees: trim overhanging branches<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Spriggs and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council
    agrees to accept the deliberations of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council was all
    in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner reported on the deliberations of the Finance Committee which had met on
    8 October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>District Audit</strong><br>
    No reply had been received from the District Auditor to a letter from the Parish Council
    enquiring why it was advised that under Asset Values the Village Hall and the Upper Up
    playing field be valued at £1 and why these items were not to be included in the Balance
    Sheet.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Disabled Access</strong><br>
    An application for grant aid made by the Parish Council to Cotswold District Council for
    the erection of the disabled access at Upper Playing fields had been successful. The panel
    awarded a grant of £4,507.50 which was 50% of the total quoted. Cllr Mrs Gardiner signed
    the letter to accept the grant conditions which the Clerk would return to CDC. Cllr Mrs
    Gardiner, in reply to a query from Cllr Nicholas, stated that the Parish Council would
    fund the other half from the general reserve. The Clerk was asked to add this item to next
    month's agenda. The Parish Council expressed its thanks to the Clerk for his efforts in
    managing the application.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Fidelity Guarantee</strong><br>
    On advice from the District Auditor the Committee recommends that the Parish Council renew
    the Fidelity Guarantee which is part of the insurance. The sum insured in the policy for
    the indemnity limit was £70,000. It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Gardiner and seconded by
    Cllr Nicholas that the Parish Council agree to renew the Fidelity Guarantee. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>

    Cllr Mrs Gardiner inspected and agreed the Clerk¹s travel expenses for September.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Dunn and seconded by Cllr Gardiner that the Parish Council agrees
    to make the above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields &amp; Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 8 October.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>CCTV Survey</strong><br>
    Three Counties Drainage Services would carry out a CCTV survey of the culvert in High
    Street but needed to liaise with Derek Taylor of Glos County Highways before work could
    commence. David Green from the CCTV company had agreed to a reduced rate of £400 to make
    the survey which had previously been agreed by the Parish Council.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Lines on Basketball area at Upper Up</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris was still awaiting confirmation from Ermin Toolhire on the supply of suitable
    equipment to paint the lines.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Litter</strong><br>
    It was not known whether or not Cllr Stuart had contacted Mr E. Curtis to enquire as to
    his willingness to pick up rubbish at both playing fields and generally throughout the
    village.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Drain Cleaning</strong><br>
    A verbal quote for £700 plus VAT had been received to dig out the open drain in Station
    Road from Mr F. Timbrell. The Committee was all in favour and recommended that the Parish
    Council agrees. The Clerk was asked to obtain a written quote and add it to the agenda of
    the next Finance Committee meeting in November. Cllr Harris had met with Martyn Summerell
    Assistant Divisional Surveyor at GCC Highways who had suggested that part funding may be
    available from GCC Highways for the drain clearance. The Clerk was asked to apply to the
    Highways for a grant to help with the cost of the project.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Mole Clearance</strong><br>
    Able Pest Control Services had given a verbal quote of £150­£170 to remove the moles
    currently infesting parts of the playing field at Upper Up. As the moles were on land used
    by the public it would not be possible to use poison to remove them. Traps would have to
    be laid which could not be guaranteed to totally remove the vermin. It was proposed by
    Cllr Gardiner and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council agrees to spend up to
    £170 in trying to clear the moles. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Hedge at Cerney Wick play area</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas declared an interest and took no part in the discussion. Mr Taffinder had
    replied to the Parish Council objecting to the pyracantha hedge being cut down to ground
    level. He had no objection to the hedge being cut back to give access to repair the fence.
    Ian Fairbrother, Chairman of the Cerney Wick Village Committee, had verbally agreed with
    Cllr Mrs Chapman to arrange for the repair of the fence when the hedge is cut back. Cllr
    Harris volunteered to contact Mr Taffinder to arrange for the pruning of the hedge.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Inspection Report</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb carried out the playground inspections. At Upper Up rubbish bins needed to
    be emptied. Pot holes were getting larger on the car park. At Robert Franklin Way play
    area the play bark required replenishment. Cllr Gardiner would arrange collection of new
    supply of play bark. Cllr Harris had replaced the round pole which was part of the play
    bark enclosure. At Cerney Wick play area autumnal leaves were collecting on the safety
    surfaces. The litter bins needed to be emptied. Cllr Stuart would be responsible for
    carrying out the inspections for the coming month.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>MILLENNIUM PARK</strong><br>
    Due to an objection from the Environment Agency it had been necessary to withdraw the
    planning application. Cllr Harris reported on a meeting held on 18 September with Paul
    Bergin from the Environmental Agency and Martin Portus to discuss the Environmental
    Agency¹s objections to the proposed building of the Millennium Park on the flood plain.
    At the meeting Cllr Harris and Mr Portus had been able to persuade Mr Bergin to withdraw
    his objection by convincing him that the plan would not create a problem. Children had
    suggested that a half pipe for skateboarding be added to the plan and this addition was
    currently being costed.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP CAR PARK EXTENSION</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris explained the proposed new layout of the car park at the entrance to the Upper
    Up playing field. He estimated that the parking area could be increased to 100 square
    metres to accommodate approximately 50 cars. The project would be included in the
    Millennium Park plan. It had been previously ascertained from CDC that planning permission
    was not required for the alteration to the car park. Cllr Mrs Gardiner suggested spending
    the Bledisloe Cup prize money on bulbs, plants or trees in the pentagonal shaped area to
    the left of the car park entrance.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Westbury Homes</strong><br>
    On 14 September Cllr Harris spoke to Mr Bacchus, Site Manager at the Limes, regarding the
    state of the verges in the vicinity of the development. Mr Bacchus apologised for their
    state and agreed to make good the untidy verges.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Tree Planting</strong><br>
    On 22 September Cllr Harris met with Sue Clark of the Gardening Club to discuss the
    positioning of two trees the Club wished to plant along the verge in High Street. Mrs
    Clark would check with GCC Highways on the site's suitability. Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Mrs
    Pearse, Cllr Mrs Spriggs and Cllr Stuart agreed to the location.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Youth Action Day</strong><br>
    The Youth Action Day organised by Bernie Cox, Cotswolds Area Team Leader for the
    Gloucestershire Youth &amp; Community Service for Sunday 30 September was a non-event with
    not one child from the village in attendance. The Parish Council was disappointed with the
    response and the Clerk was to ask Mr Cox for an explanation as to why this situation had
    occurred.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bledisloe Cup</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris showed the cup and two framed certificates which had been presented to the
    village. Mr &amp; Mrs Kingsbury were willing to display the cup in the Post Office. The
    Parish Council thanked Cllr Gardiner and Cllr Stuart for the erection of the plaque at the
    Old Cross. Cllr Harris confirmed that the Bledisloe Cup organisers were responsible for
    its insurance. Cllr Stuart was also thanked for organising the document outlining
    activities and achievements in the village which would form the basis of the presentation
    in the next round of the Village of the Year competition. Allocation of the £100 prize
    money would be decided at the next Parish Council meeting in November.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Weeping Willow in Meadow Way</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had removed excess growth from the tree but more pruning of the lower branches
    was necessary. CWP Countryside Services, Mark Cox and one other should be asked to quote
    for this work.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way play area Sub-Committee</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas had no response from residents to join the play area sub-committee. Cllr Mrs
    Chubb, Cllr Gardiner, Cllr Harris and Cllr Nicholas volunteered to form the committee and
    the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>South Cerney Parish Council Web Site</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas argued that a web site would be pro-active means to swiftly disseminate
    Parish Council information. It would increase community involvement. It was an untapped
    media which could involve a significant number of local residents who had access to the
    web. He had obtained a quotation from Commatic Ltd to provide, service and manage a web
    site on behalf of the Parish Council. Set up costs would be in the region of £500 with
    approximately £200 per annum for servicing, licencing and tuition. It was agreed that
    Raymond Fenton be approached for a comparative quote. The Clerk was asked to add this item
    to next month's Parish Council agenda.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Alteration to Bus Service timetable</strong><br>
    A petition with 40 names had been received protesting to the change in the timing of the
    51 bus service by Stagecoach. Users of the service had not been informed in advance of the
    alteration and the Clerk was asked to complain about the inconvenience caused to
    passengers.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Community Hall</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas suggested that the Parish Council should seek professional help in
    negotiating with Westbury Homes regarding the provision of the new Community Hall. Cllr
    Nicholas asked that the Parish Council agree to his offer to approach a consultant, on an
    informal basis, for advice. The Parish Council was in favour. Cllr Mrs Spriggs suggested
    that local advice should be sought from Parish Councils who had similar experiences. Cllr
    Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Nicholas and the Clerk would attend a meeting with Hunter Page Planning
    to discuss costings of the new Community Hall on 18 October.<br>
