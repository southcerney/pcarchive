    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    I would like to welcome all Parish Councillors, especially the five new members attending
    this evening, to this new term.<br>
    On Thursday 10 April I took delivery of a radar gun from Alf Reynolds and Cllr King
    collected it from me that evening. The gun was returned to Mr Reynolds on Thursday 24
    April.<br>
    Regarding the ramp at Upper Up playing field. On advice from the DDA office I contacted Mr
    Roger Jarvis who is an architect under a scheme managed by the Architect Advisory Service
    whereby the first hour of consultation is free. I rang Quattro Design and arranged with Ms
    Pauline Dewhurst to visit the site to suggest an alternative design and the cost of
    alterations. On 6 May I had a meeting with Roger Jarvis for similar discussions. Both
    professionals have replied.<br>
    In April of the 20 working days available I logged 66.5 hours which I averages 3.325 hours
    per day. Over the period this represents approximately 2.5 hours more per week than is
    allowed for in my contract. Last month it was 3.5 hours per week and I forecast that in
    May my duties will also exceed my contract due to the formation of the new Parish Council
    and the extra meeting at this time of year.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Upper Up Ramp</strong><br>
    Correspondence had been received from Roger Jarvis and Quattro Design Ltd. Roger Jarvis
    was uncommitted as to exactly what work would be entailed in modifying the ramp for use by
    disabled persons. Quattro Design Ltd was more explicit stating that complete
    reconstruction would be necessary if access was to provided for people with disabilities.
    In principle the ramp is not to be recommended for people with disabilities due to the
    poor visibility of the road crossing at this point and the absence of a connecting
    footpath from the car park entrance. Quattro Design Ltd recommends access for disabled
    people at the car park which offers better visibility and has level access and indicate
    alternative disabled access by clear signage. They further suggest that the speed bump at
    the car park entrance be removed, replace the gravel surface with tarmac and provide
    designated disabled parking spaces in an appropriate location. In any event these works
    would be required in order to comply with the DDA as at present there is no suitable
    provision for disabled users arriving by car and the gravel surface is deemed unsuitable.
    The Parish Council decided that Glos County Highways be instructed to erect the barriers
    as agreed and when complete T. Sibbick will be asked to finish off the lower platform.
    Members of the Village Maintenance and Playing Fields Committee will arrange to have a
    site meeting to decide how much of the car park should be tarmaced.<br>
    <strong>Clerk's Hours</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to continue to keep a log of his hours worked.<br>
    <strong>Mill Close and Boxbush</strong><br>
    Planning Conditions relating to the development CT.3887/1/J (27.3.81) for the erection of
    18 O.A.P. bungalows and 52 houses at Boxbush had been received from CDC.<br>
    <strong>Golf Balls</strong><br>
    It was noted that Mr Franklin had not as yet erected a warning notice on the stile from
    Webb's field to the Canal.<br>
    <strong>Play Equipment</strong> <br>
    Cllr Harris had been asked by Mr Groves of Ash Moon, owner of a property adjacent to
    Robert Franklin Way playing field, to be kept informed of alterations to the design and
    layout of the play area.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas' offer to deal with planning matters was agreed to by the Parish Council.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Planning applications received by Cotswold District Council</strong><br>
    <strong>CT.0006/3/L</strong><br>
    (1) Amendment to location of club house further towards the eastern boundary; (2)
    Amendment to location of storage compound; (3) Landscaping revision at Lake 16, Spine
    Road, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.0649/1/Z</strong><br>
    Revision to extension roof at jointing point with main dwelling at 13 Meadow Way, South
    Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.0649/2/B</strong><br>
    Demolition and replacement of kitchen extension at 55 Meadow Way, South Cerney<br>

    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.1854/A</strong><br>
    Minor amendment. Erection of detached garage at Hailwood, Station Road, South Cerney<br>
    Although this application has been granted subsequently, the Planning Committee strongly
    objected to this proposal. The garage would be a substantial structure in a very
    conspicuous position in front of the 'building line'. It would have an adverse effect on
    the visual amenity of this part of the village and would set an unwelcome precedent for
    other garages to be built in front of the building line<br>
    OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    <strong>CT.2249/F</strong><br>
    Erection of 1 (one) dwelling and garage. Revision to previously approved scheme at
    Fairholm, Silver Street, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.2475/1/N</strong><br>
    Industrial unit with associated site works at land at Evergreen Industrial Estate,
    Broadway Lane, South Cerney<br>

    unacceptable for premises so close to the edge of this densely populated village. There
    would be undue disturbance to the residents of Beverstone Road and all other nearby
    neighbourhoods if this industrial unit were to be in use from 7.30am six days per week.
    Cllr Jay and Cllr Smith disagreed with the Committee's objection to the hours of work.<br>

    dormer windows on southern elevation (drawing no 9644/17/B) on application to erect a

    highway and drainage infrastructure and landscaping at Lake 75, Cotswold Water Park, South
    Cerney, Glos.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <strong>CT.4204/B</strong><br>
    Replacement of culvert with a navigable underbridge to include a pedestrian and cycle
    underpass (revised details). Site: Thames &amp; Severn Canal Crossing SU073 972, Western
    Spine Road 2086 Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney<br>
    NO OBJECTION (RATIFIED)<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council agrees to
    accept the above deliberations and to ratify the decisions of the Planning Committee on
    those applications which it determined.<br>
    <br>

    The Clerk had asked CDC Planning that the Parish Council be given an opportunity to
    comment on the travellers development at Shorncote. Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) and Cllr Baines
    (CDC) were urged to voice the Parish Council's objection to the encampment to CDC and
    reiterate its request to be involved in the consultation.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>FINANCE</strong><br>
    The Clerk made a report on the financial activities of the Parish Council for the previous
    month.<br>

    The Clerk informed Parish Councillors that two letters requesting payment from Mr Hewer
    had been ignored. He asked for permission to use the Small Claims Court to pursue Mr Hewer
    for payment. It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Squire that the Clerk
    use the Small Claims Court to recover the debt. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Payments</strong><br>

    Cllr Stuart inspected and agreed the Clerk's travel expenses for April. It was proposed by
    Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr Smith that the Parish Council agrees to make the
    above payments. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Bank Signing Instructions</strong><br>
    The Lloyds TSB form to change the signing instructions for the Parish Council's account
    was completed. New signatories added were Cllr Jay, Cllr Smith, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb.
    Cllr Nicholas remains a signatory. Ex parish Councillors Mrs Gardiner, King and Mrs
    Spriggs were to be removed as signatories.<br>
    <strong>CPRE Membership Renewal</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Harris that membership of CPRE be
    renewed at a cost of £25. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris' offer to deal with playing fields and village maintenance matters was agreed
    to by the Parish Council.<br>
    <strong>Wildmoorway Lane</strong><br>
    The Clerk would ask GCC Highways to consider erecting speed restriction signs on
    Wildmoorway Lane.<br>
    <strong>Children at Play signs</strong><br>
    The Clerk would ask GCC Highways to consider erecting 'Children at Play' signs either side
    of the entrance to Jubilee Gardens entrance in High Street.<br>
    <strong>Open Drain in Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    The Clerk would enquire from D. Taylor GCC Highways when it was intended to fill in or
    repair the open drain between the Long House and Oklahoma in Cerney Wick.<br>
    <strong>Flower Tubs</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman had not made contact as yet with Mr M. Chamberlain but hoped to do so
    shortly.<br>
    <strong>Radar Speed Gun</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Spriggs had used the speed detector between 8.30am and 9.15am on a
    Monday but found, generally, the speed monitored was not significantly above the set
    limit. Cllr Nicholas stated that the results from Cllr Dunn and Cllr King who took
    readings during an evening period were similar to those that he had recorded. The Clerk
    will forward the data for analysis to Alf Reynolds, GCC Highways Road Safety Officer.<br>
    <strong>Tree in River</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that a tree had fallen into the river Churn alongside the Robert
    Franklin Way playing field. The Clerk would report the incident to the Environment Agency.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Park</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris declared his prejudicial interest as contractor and stated that work had
    started on the Upper Up scheme. He proposed changes to the design of the water feature
    which included the formation of an island. He then left the meeting for the Parish Council
    to debate his suggestion. After a discussion it was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by
    Cllr Mrs Chapman that the Parish Council reject the proposed changes to the original plan.
    The Parish Council was all in favour. The Parish Council was minded to accept the cost
    incurred for the re-tendering of the scheme after the first exercise collapsed. The Clerk
    was asked to negotiate a site inspection fee compromise, which had not been already
    agreed, with Whitton Associates. Cllr Harris was invited to return to the meeting. Cllr
    Jay was said that he was wholeheartedly in favour of the Upper Up development scheme. Cllr
    Harris then explained that various extra unaccountable problems had arisen since work had
    started. For example a portion of ditch would have to be cleared adjoining the scheme and
    part of the second team football pitch needed levelling. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and
    seconded by Cllr Squire that the contingency fund specified in the contract be used in
    these cases. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Churchyard Wall Extension</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that probate on the late Lord Fanshawe's estate had been settled.
    Quotes had been received to move the stone wall and a decision would be taken in the near
    future.<br>
    <strong>Gloucestershire Village of the Year 2003</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart said that as the judging would take place between 16­28 June there was not
    enough lead time to create a presentation.<br>
    <strong>SEB Activity in High Street and Station Road</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to enquire from SEB on the purpose of their recent work.<br>
    <strong>Aircraft Noise</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that an enquiry was held in 2002 into the activities of the Silver
    Stars and Williams Air Services. This went through the military chain of command to the
    Under Secretary of State. He concluded that flying could continue at South Cerney by both
    the Silver Stars and Williams Air Services with some restrictions as suggested by the
    military command: (i) only flying three weekends out of four or approximately 39 weekends
    per year; (ii) restricted flying times at weekends (not before 10am and early evenings
    depending on time of year but not into summer dusk.<br>
    Cllr Stuart continued stating that other aircraft do fly and land at South Cerney at these
    set times into the prevailing wind but these are not for parachuting purposes. Also,
    Kemble has several light aircraft which often overfly the village at times outside of the
    restricted periods imposed on South Cerney.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart had carried out the inspections for the last period. At Upper Up the
    basketball net was still tattered, the grass had not been cut in the vicinity of the play
    equipment and the Clerk was asked to contact whoever was responsible for its maintenance.
    At Robert Franklin Way one seat on the swing had quite a bad split and a serious attempt
    to lever off the top fixings had been made. The base was useless and empty of bark. The
    area between the goal posts was showing signs of deterioration and Cllr Stuart suggested
    that if one post was moved it would then create a more suitable play area. At Cerney Wick
    the rubbish bin needed to be emptied. The bases of the play equipment required to be
    swept. Bushes were overgrowing and limited the visibility of the area from the road. Cllr
    Stuart proposed that instead of one councillor inspecting the three sites, Playing Fields
    and Village Maintenance committee members living in the vicinity of a play area should
    make the weekly inspection. Cllr Harris volunteered to inspect the play area at Robert
    Franklin Way, Cllr Mrs Chapman, although not a committee member, agreed to inspect the
    Cerney Wick play area and Cllr Stuart would inspect the play area at Upper Up. Cllr Mrs
    Chubb agreed to make a regular report on the overall condition of the play areas. The
    Clerk was asked to redesign a form to suit these new arrangements. Cllr Harris reported
    that a pyracantha hedge near the Robert Franklin Way play area near Lakeside Road was
    overgrowing and needed to be cut back.<br>
