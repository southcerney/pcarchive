    Apologies had been received from Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC).<br>

    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 12 JUNE 2002</strong><br>
    Page 6 ­ South Cerney Village Hall ­ Annual Accounts: last word ... require.... change
    to read: invite.<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Pearse and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Minutes as
    amended, were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour and the
    Minutes were signed by the Chairman Cllr Mrs Gardiner.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Burial Authority</strong><br>
    Cllr Dunn had determined that the Parish Council was ultimately responsible for the
    provision of a churchyard. He ascertained from the Diocese of Gloucester that the present
    churchyard cannot be closed until full and the CDC had no obligation to provide for a new
    one. Lady Fanshawe had indicated that she was prepared to honour her late husband's offer
    to donate land adjacent to the present churchyard thereby extending its use for burials.
    So, therefore, it was in the interest of the Parish Council, through its Burial Authority
    Sub-Committee, to provide funding for the stone wall extension and both parties legal fees
    in the transfer of the land. If the Parish Council did not take advantage of this
    situation it would be obliged to purchase new land for burials when the existing
    churchyard reached capacity. The Clerk was to enquire from the Parochial Church Council
    what action had been taken regarding the funding of the wall extension and to establish
    from the Rev J. Calvert the precise cost of providing the wall.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLANNING</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee whichhad met on 8
    July.<br>
    <br>
    Matters Arising<br>
    CT.3115/E (known as Plot 2)<br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported that Cllr Mrs Clark (CDC) had investigated the behaviour of
    planning officers regarding this application. Planning officers were adamant that proper
    procedure had been adhered to with changes to the original plan considered as minor
    amendments being duly approved by planning officers. It was to be regretted that planning
    officers did not keep Mr Beard fully informed of all the changes. The Clerk was asked to
    notify Mr T. Jones, Head of Planning at CDC that the way this application was handled by
    CDC was far from satisfactory. The Parish Council considered that the development, with
    its history of appeal, was a sensitive scheme to adjacent households and more care should
    have been taken in informing interested parties especially Mr Beard.<br>
    CT.5804/R<br>
    Major Bob Pratt, Property Manager and Quartermaster at the Duke of Gloucester Barracks had
    explained the necessity of siting the shelter/hanger in its isolated position on the
    airfield. As the hanger would be used as an ammunition preparation facility regulations
    dictated that it must not be sited within 405 metres of residential housing. Major Pratt
    made it especially clear that the building would not be used as an ammunition storage
    facility. Cllr Jones (CDC) would make further enquiries as the Planning Authority was
    sympathetic to the Parish Council's original objection.<br>
    Phase 1 Section 106 Agreement (Commuted Sum) CAMAS site&nbsp; It was proposed by Cllr
    Stuart and seconded by Cllr Mrs Gardiner that the Parish Council asks Westbury Homes
    directly for the £13,000 agreed when it entered into the Section 106 Agreement with it
    for the transfer of land for future maintenance and improvement of the play areas in lieu
    of play equipment. The Parish Council was all in favour. Correspondence to be copied to
    CDC.<br>

    Clerk was ask to congratulate the planning officers at CDC for the care and foresight
    shown in drawing up the Conditions on this permission. Condition 2 is noteworthy.
    &quot;Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted
    Development) Order 1995, or any other statutory instrument amending or replacing it, no
    extension, structure, building, hardstanding, fence, wall or other means of enclosure
    shall be erected, constructed or inserted on the application site, other than those
    permitted by this Decision Notice. The site has a distinct and attractive character and
    appearance which should be maintained. In order to protect these qualities, it is
    essential for the Local Planning Authority to maintain control over the types of
    development listed above, in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 1, 29
    and 40, PPG1 and PPG15.&quot; Since Cllr Stuart was concerned that the contractors were
    removing the hedge adjoining Upper Up, the Clerk was asked to notify Mr M. Grace
    Enforcement Officer at CDC urgently to inspect the work as Conditions 15, 18, 19 and 21 of
    the Consent were not being applied.<br>

    <br>
    <strong>Stile on BSC17</strong><br>

    Highways.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Spine Road Warning Signs</strong><br>
    Cllr Gardiner reported that the new cycle track on the Spine Road had created new hazards.

    Highways.<br>
    <br>

    <br>

    The Committee decided to invite Mr Mould, South Cerney Trust Footpaths Officer, to its
    next meeting in August to discuss the general condition of public rights of way in the
    Parish.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Ramp at Upper Up</strong><br>

    of the new access ramp to the Upper Up playing fields.<br>
    <br>

    Cllr Harris had spoken with S. Clark who assured him that work would start shortly on the
    reinstatement of the car park.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Wall at Englefield, Station Road</strong><br>
    The Clerk reported that Westbury Homes would repair the wall adjoining the Limes and
    Englefield. Mr Hament (Westbury Homes) had apologised for the delay.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Station Road Mud</strong><br>
    Complaints had been received about the mud deposits left on Station Road to the Spine Road
    from heavy vehicles leaving the development site. Earlier today the Clerk had used this
    stretch of highway and found it to be very clean and clear of any mud deposits.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Football Club</strong><br>
    The Football Club had asked for permission to prepare two temporary junior football
    pitches behind the tennis courts for a period of two years. It was proposed by Cllr Harris
    and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish Council grants permission to the football club
    for two temporary football pitches.The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <br>
    Fly Tipping<br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that a motorbike frame had been dumped near the timber garages in
    Upper Up and asked the Clerk to report the incident to the Environment department at CDC.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris had carried out the inspections over the previous period. Cllr Harris will
    liaise with Cllr Stuart and organise white lines to be painted on the basketball apparatus
    at Upper Up. Safety tiles at Upper Up and Cerney Wick were slippery and power spraying
    should be considered if the weather does not improve. The old fence posts at Cerney Wick
    had not been removed but Cllr Mrs Chapman would raise the problem at the next Cerney Wick
    Village Hall meeting. Cllr Harris requested that she also asks that the overgrowing hedge
    on the playing field be cut back. The Clerk reported that he was awaiting a quotation for
    replacement seats and a rope climbing frame from Wicksteed Leisure. Cllr Gardiner will
    carry out the inspection in the coming period.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPPER UP PARK REPORT</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the Sub-Committee had met to discuss grant aid for the project.
    Cllr King and Cllr Nicholas, who was absent from the meeting, agreed to liaise with Dr
    Simon Pickering and CDC to progress grant applications. Cllr Harris reported that
    negotiations on the tender were continuing with Creoda. Cllr Harris stated that CDC
    acknowledged that planning permission had been applied for on 25 April but as yet
    determination was awaited. Cllr Nicholas reminded the meeting that as CDC had restricted
    the Community Fund and Ward Fund grants it was not realistic to depend on these sources
    for substantial funding. It was therefore likely that there would be a shortfall in the
    amount needed for the project. Consequently either part of the plan would have to be
    curtailed or a further increase in the next year¹s precept would be necessary in order to
    make up the difference.<br>

    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Cerney Pre-School Playgroup ­ Appeal for support to enhance
    the group's facilities Mike Svensson attended the meeting for discussion on behalf of the
    South Cerney Pre-School Playgroup. He explained that the GCC Education Authority, owners
    of the land, were only prepared to grant a 7 year lease because of the uncertainties
    generated through the appeal by Westbury Homes on the remainder of the CAMAS site. If the
    Playgroup was to benefit from certain grant applications a 21 year lease was required.
    Cllr Nicholas recalled that at the Westbury Homes appeal enquiry the Education Authority
    had submitted that it would not be a requirement to upgrade facilities at Ann Edwards
    School if their appeal was successful and he did not understand that it should now be a
    reason to reduce the lease period to 7 years. The Playgroup had asked the Parish Council
    to write to the Playgroup Committee expressing its support for the project. The Parish
    Council was all in favour and earlier in the meeting had donated £600 to the Playgroup.<br>

    <strong>COUNCILLOR'S REPORTS</strong><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported on a consultation organised by the CDC to discuss the future of
    Cotswold District Council and the services it provides at theVillage Hall recently had
    been poorly attended. Besides a contingent from CDC, three Parish Councillors including
    Cllr Mrs Gardiner, Cllr Harris and Cllr Stuart, the Head Teacher of Southrop School and
    two residents of Stratton, Cirencester were in attendance. Cllr Stuart wished to
    compliment CDC for the presentation which he found very informative but suggested that
    perhaps the start time of 6pm was too early to attract a larger audience. Cllr Jones
    reported that the review of the Local Plan was nearing completion and a draft would
    available for consultation in the autumn. Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to inform D.
    Taylor, GCC Highways that overgrowing grass was obscuring the sightlines at the junction
    of Cerney Wick Lane and the Spine Road. She also requested that the Sailing Club be asked
    to trim back the hedge adjoining Cerney Wick Lane.<br>

    There being no further business Cllr Mrs Gardiner closed the meeting at 9.40pm</td>
