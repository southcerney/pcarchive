    <td>The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>APOLOGIES</strong><br>
    Apologies had been received from Cllr Caunce, Cllr Pollard, Cllr Baines (CDC), Cllr Mrs
    Clark (CDC) and Cllr Parsons (GCC). Cllr Baines (CDC) informed the Clerk that he had been
    appointed Chairman of the Priority Action Team which was formed to look after the
    interests of youth aged 12­24 in the District.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 13 AUGUST 2003</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Smith that the Minutes were a true and
    accurate record. Cllr Harris and Cllr Nicholas abstained from voting as both were absent
    from the August meeting. The rest of the Parish Council was all in favour and the Minutes
    were signed by the Chairman Cllr Stuart.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>MATTERS ARISING<br>
    Pedestrian Crossing</strong><br>
    Cllr Nicholas asked for clarification of the decision made at the August meeting objecting
    to a GCC Highways proposal to install a pedestrian crossing in High Street as part of a
    planned impact scheme. Cllr Nicholas said that he was aware of a sizeable opinion in
    favour of a zebra crossing. Cllr Jay explained that GCC Highways had presented an impact
    scheme which included resurfacing the carriageway from the Royal Oak public house in High
    Street to Greystones in Station Road together with the construction of a pedestrian
    crossing and associated parallel parking bays opposite the Mitie works. If a decision was
    not forthcoming on whether or not to accept the impact scheme then the total scheme could
    be delayed. As plans for the full scheme were not available the Parish Council objected to
    the proposed scheme.<p><strong>CLERK'S CONTRACT</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay reported on a meeting of the Personnel Committee held on 26 August to discuss
    revising the number of hours worked by the Clerk in the light of the ever-increasing
    workload experienced. It was agreed that Cllr Nicholas be allowed to withdraw from the
    Committee as the Clerk was a client of his firm. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded
    by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish Council increases the weekly employment of its Clerk
    from 15 hours to 18 hours with the increase in hours backdated to 1 April 2003. With the
    exception of Cllr Nicholas, who abstained, the Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    Cllr Jay wished to alert members of the Parish Council that this decision to increase the
    Clerk's working hours would exceed the amount budgeted in the accounts.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>CLERK'S REPORT</strong><br>
    On 19th August on behalf of the Parish Council I made an Attachment of Earnings order on
    Robert Hewer at Swindon Magistrates Court. The original debt of £295 was increased with
    initial fees by £30 to £325. To make an attachment of earnings order a further fee of
    £60 was paid boosting the total outstanding to £385.<br>
    Various people had been in contact about ground maintenance in South Cerney since Jeremy
    Simmons Landscapes Ltd went into liquidation. To obtain the most competitive quote I have
    been referring interested contractors to our web site, especially to read recent Minutes
    which will give a guide to what the Parish Council was paying the previous contractor.<br>
    The Parish Council meeting in April 2004 is scheduled for Wednesday 14. Normal Committee
    meetings would therefore take place on Easter Monday which falls on 12. This means that
    the Committee meetings and Parish Council meeting must be changed to either the 5 and 7 or
    19 and 21. As the March meetings are planned for 8 &amp; 10 may I suggest that the Parish
    Council agrees to meet on the 5 &amp; 7 of April which would give a 4 week gap rather than
    the 19 &amp; 21 which would mean a break of 6 weeks between meetings. The Parish Council
    decided to discuss this matter at its next meeting. In August I worked 77.75 hours which
    averaged 3 hours 40 minutes per available working day which justifies the extra time
    allocated in my revised contract.<br>
    On 9 September I attended a meeting of the reorganised Robert Franklin Way Playground Sub
    Committee in the Village Hall. Also present was Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Squire and Mr Simon
    King. Mr King outlined the history and achievements of the previous Sub Committee which
    had started to disintegrate at the end of the previous Parish Council term. Difficulties
    and delays experienced in sourcing suitable grant funding was also a factor in its lack of
    action. Nevertheless the plan for the project was still viable and the Sub Committee
    agreed that new tenders should be sought. The Le Spa and Hags units were ready for
    installation but it was agreed to delay this until the rest of the plan had been costed
    and grant funding achieved. Loosely it was envisaged that Phase 1 of the scheme would cost
    about £40k. It was decided to break Phase 1 into four elements: 1. Safety Surface, 2. Le
    Spa and Hags equipment, 3. Paths and fence work and 4. The supply and installation of new
    equipment. The Parish Council had budgeted for approximately half of this. One third or
    £13k may be forthcoming from a CDC Community grant which left a shortfall of £7k. The
    Clerk would contact various agencies to see if they might fund this. Mr King agreed to
    meet up with the Clerk on Tuesday 16 September to prepare a contract tender and the Sub
    Committee agreed to meet in the first week of October to consider what progress had been
    made.<br>
    <br>

    permission stated: &quot;The residential accommodation shall be occupied only by persons
    who are employed solely or mainly at Lake 10, Cotswold water Park, or the immediate family
    of such persons.&quot; The Clerk was asked to obtain a copy of any response made.<br>
    <strong>CT.7318/D Mill Cottage, Cerney Wick</strong><br>
    Mr Colin Davis CDC Enforcement Officer confirmed that amended drawings had been received
    for the door in the gable. Mr Davis would visit the site to inspect the roof height.<br>

    Mr C. Davis (Enforcement Officer) confirmed that he had written to Ms Lloyd advising her
    to abide with the conditions of the planning permission for the wall at Orchard House
    within 28 days. Cllr Nicholas asked the Clerk to obtain confirmation that an enforcement
    notice had been issued. He was to ask for clarification on whether the stone pillars were
    to be reinstated and to enquire about the new metal gates with stone pillars which was not
    detailed in any application to date. The Parish Council also wished to know what action
    was to be taken regarding the larch lap fence which was still in place although permission
    had been granted only for a temporary fence.<br>

    &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; were treating the building as an advertisement hoarding
    and as such would have an adverse impact on the visual amenity of this rural setting.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council agrees to
    accept the above deliberations and to ratify the decisions of the Planning Committee on

    <strong>Dentist's Sign in Sudeley Drive</strong><br>

    occupied for more than six years. The Clerk had forwarded a copy of the correspondence to
    Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) who had acknowledged receipt and promised to investigate the
    circumstances. The Parish Council agreed with Cllr Nicholas who suggested that the Parish
    Council could encourage GCC to expedite the adoption.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>PLAYING FIELDS &amp; VILLAGE MAINTENANCE</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance
    Committee which had met on 11 August.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Litter Picking</strong><br>
    Mr Curtis had attended the Committee meeting to discuss litter picking throughout the
    village of South Cerney. Mr Curtis made it clear that he would be responsible only for the
    play areas, paths and roadsides in the village excepting that area in Berkeley Close
    around the Flats and would not consider any maintenance. Mr Curtis agreed to a proposal
    from the Committee to include but not be restricted to the following areas: The War
    Memorial, Cross, Upper Up and playing fields, Robert Franklin Way and play area, Bow Wow,
    Clarks Hay, Ditch in Station Road, outside Londis, the path from the Village Hall to Upper
    Up, the Piece and around all public seating. It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by
    Cllr Harris that the Parish Council should pay £5 per hour for 1 hour per day Monday to
    Friday inclusively for litter picking and the arrangement to be reviewed by both parties
    after 6 months' trial. The Parish Council was all in favour. The Clerk then suggested that
    he negotiate with Mr Curtis and offer him £100 per month and the Parish Council
    concurred. Cllr Harris had thanked Mr Curtis at the Committee meeting for his
    conscientious cleaning of the bus shelter outside the Limes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Matters Arising</strong><br>
    <strong>Basketball Net</strong><br>
    The Committee decided to remove the damaged basketball net and not to replace it.<br>
    <strong>Grass Cutting throughout the public areas in the Village</strong><br>
    Two quotations for grass cutting had been received. It was proposed by Cllr Smith and
    seconded by Cllr Webb that the cheaper quote from Lee Ponting be accepted. With the
    exception of Cllr Squire who voted against, the Parish Council was in favour.<br>
    <strong>Graveyard Grass Cutting</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Squire that the Parish Council
    agrees to a verbal quote from Tim Stephens to mow and strim the graveyard at a cost of
    £70 per cut. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>GPFA</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish Council
    agrees to renew its membership of Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association at a cost of
    £50. The Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way play area</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Stuart that the Parish Council accepts
    a quote from R. O. W. Berry of £145 to replace the play bark under the swings. The Parish
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Hedge</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council agrees to
    a verbal quote from David Chubb to cut back the hedge surrounding the playing fields with
    a flail at a cost of £20. Cllr Mrs Chubb declared a prejudicial interest and did not
    vote. The remainder of the<br>
    Parish Council was all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Storage of Le Spa equipment</strong><br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council agrees to
    a suggestion from Macventure Play Co. that the storage rental outstanding of 5 weeks to
    the end of August be charged at the current rate £12 per week and a fixed charge of £125
    be levied to cover the 5 months from 1st September to 31st January. The Parish Council was
    all in favour.<br>
    <strong>Path from Upper Mill to Meadow Way</strong><br>
    The Clerk was asked to enquire from GCC Highways if it was possible to make the sign more
    visible to prevent bicycles from being ridden on this path.<br>
    <strong>Upper Up Park</strong><br>
    After a request by Cllr Harris, Cllr Stuart proposed and Cllr Jay seconded that the Parish
    Council agrees to accept that the weeds and other growth on the Upper Up Park are mown and
    the residue left in situ in lieu of the hay cut as stipulated in the contract. Cllr Harris
    declared a prejudicial interest and did not vote. The remainder of the Parish Council was
    in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>INSPECTION REPORTS</strong><br>
    <strong>Upper Up Play Area</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chubb noted that the safety tiles around the junior, senior swings and activity
    area were coming apart. One rung was missing from ladder at left hand side of activity
    area and other rings have been hacked. The Chairman asked Cllr Harris for an immediate
    quote in view of the urgency of the situation. Cllr Harris quoted £110 to replace all the
    rungs with solid aluminium bars. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Mrs
    Chubb that James Harris Contracting should proceed with the repair as quickly as possible.
    Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest and did not vote. The remainder of the Parish
    Council was in favour. The Parish Council agreed with a suggestion from Cllr Nicholas that
    the cycle mounds be added to the list of items on the inspection form.<br>
    <strong>Robert Franklin Way Play Area</strong><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the play bark level needed to be refilled. The old goal mouth
    needed to be levelled and seeded. The top of the pyracantha bush, which sides had recently
    been pruned, should be reduced in height to around 5 feet from pavement level. In the den
    alongside self seeded ash trees and other low growth should be removed to give a view to
    the inside of this area. The Clerk was to ask R. O. W. Berry and James Harris Contracting
    to quote for this work. Mr Groves of Ash Moon, had written to warn that youths were using
    the den for nefarious purposes.<br>
    <strong>Cerney Wick Play Area</strong><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that two cross members of the fence needed to be replaced and
    another required to be re-fixed. The hedge near the entrance to the front of the play area
    needed to be trimmed back.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Council was in favour.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Maintenance Quotations</strong><br>
    The Finance Committee had agreed that all the recommendations by the Playing Fields and
    Village Maintenance Committee be accepted.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Graveyard Stone Wall Extension</strong><br>
    Cllr Squire reported that the PCC had received four quotations to extend the natural stone
    wall at the graveyard and the Finance Committee recommends that the Parish Council agrees
    to accept the lowest at £9,323. Cllr Squire calculated that the final grant required by
    the PCC, which would include a registry charge albeit defrayed by a CDC grant, will be
    £8,410. Cllr Squire agreed that the PCC will supervise the construction contract. It was
    proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish Council agrees to make a
    grant of £8,410 to the PCC to extend the graveyard wall.<br>
    Cllr Squire declared a prejudicial interest and did not vote. The remainder of the Parish
    Council was in favour.<br>
    <strong>Committee Meeting Arrangements</strong><br>
    Cllr Jay suggested that the timing of the Committee Meetings should be rearranged
    permanently to allow decisions on budget expenses by the Playing Fields and Village
    Maintenance Committee to be agreed by the Finance Committee. The Parish Council agreed
    that Monday evening committee meetings start with the Playing Fields and Village
    Maintenance, followed by the Finance and Planning committees.<br>
