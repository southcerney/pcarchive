 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Walker and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chapman that the Minutes, as amended, were a true and accurate record. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour and Cllr Nicholas signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge (YPC) apologised on behalf of the group as no 
 one had been available to attend the August meeting. He explained that YPC 
 members had been otherwise committed to summer activities. The group had been 
 involved with Claire Dowan (CDC) on a plan for the future and how the YPC might 
 develop. Currently it was researching the possibility of providing a youth 
 shelter but a longer term plan was to have a permanent youth club building. 
 Cllr Nicholas read part of a letter detailing changes in the criteria for the 
 award of grants from CDC for future projects. The Clerk was asked for forward 
 an email from Mary Mychaleckyj (Youth Worker) for the attention of the YPC. 
 Mary had asked if there was funding available and Cllr Nicholas explained that 
 the Parish Council will inform her of the YPC funds and that the Parish Council 
 itself had funds available through allotment for the advancement of the Parish 
 Plan. Joe informed the Parish Council that there were now seven members of the 
 YPC but a questionnaire was being prepared to promote the activities of the 
 group and encourage others to join. Cllr Caunce enquired if feed back could be 
 gathered on the use and proposed changes to the Upper Up bicycle humps and 
 bumps area. Cllr Harris would also welcome any comments about the future use of 
 the Scout Hut. Joe Lodge replied that mostly the observations were positive but 
 there was criticism about the height of the roof which was generally considered 
 to be too low. Joe enquired if there was anything to report on the provision of 
 the MUGA. The Clerk replied that Cllr Stuart, Cllr Webb and himself had met 
 with a supplier Steven Woodd from Kompan Ltd who had supplied costings. Cllr 
 Stuart was actively sourcing grant funding for the project. Joe then left the 
 meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 14th August I asked Gloucestershire Highways if they 
 would analyse the sludge in the open ditch in Station Road. As it was suspected 
 that the deposits were contaminated with sewage they referred me to the 
 Environmental Health at CDC who had previously suggested the Highways or the 
 Environment Agency. Eventually I spoke to Rob Bull at CDC who advised that any 
 sewage left for 6 months or more would become inert and therefore not 
 dangerous. He did agree to investigate if there was a budget available at the 
 District Council for such an analysis. Kate Bishop, Environmental Public 
 Protection Manager at CDC informed me that if the Parish Council wanted to 
 analyse the detritus it would have to make its own arrangements but did arrange 
 for me to meet with Hilary Beach (CDC) and inspect the ditch. On Friday 31st 
 August I met with Ms Beach, Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Stuart to discuss the 
 sludge in the ditch. Ms Beach agreed that the sewage sludge, which Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb confirmed had been in the ditch for nearly 9 months, would more than 
 possibly be classed as inert. It would be the responsibility of the contractor 
 who extracted the deposit to dispose of it according to the law governing that 
 procedure. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Martyn Midgeley, Gloucestershire Highways emailed that 
 provisionally the meeting to discuss the junction of Cerney Wick Lane, Station 
 Road and Spine Road had been rearranged for Friday 28th September at 12.30. 
 Consequently, I booked the Committee Room in the Village Hall if a follow on 
 meeting was required. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Lady Fanshawe informed me, after receiving the letter from 
 the Parish Council, enquiring about the availability of the keys to unlock the 
 sluice gate, that Peter Spielberg had reacted immediately to the crisis. The 
 key is always available through Lady Fanshawe although control of the sluice is 
 in conjunction with the Environment Agency. Lady Fanshawe was concerned about a 
 ditch which had been filled in when her neighbours, the Greenbergs, excavated a 
 pond in a field adjacent to her land. For the first time in 40 years her yard 
 had flooded as a result of the contractor filling in the ditch. Currently she 
 is employing a surveyor to determine the responsibility for her dilemma. Later 
 Mr Spielberg telephoned to report that on the day of the flood he had been in 
 regular contact with the Environment Agency and acted on its advice throughout 
 the crisis. He emphasised that he frequently greased and oiled the mechanism 
 and lock on the apparatus. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On the evening of Wednesday 29th August I attended a 
 meeting of the South Cotswolds Neighbourhood Area Police and Community 
 Consultative Meeting at Rencomb Village Hall. There was a good turnout with 
 approximately 45 people attending. The meeting was chaired by Mrs Vera Clouston 
 a member of the Police Authority for nearly 5 years. An analysis of crime and 
 its detection in the area compared to the past year was given by Inspector 
 Steve Williams. PCSO Pooley and Police Sergeant Phil Mohamed in charge of 
 community policing in the south Cotswolds also attended. Another permanent PCSO 
 will be joining Lesley Pooley shortly on her patrol. It is now possible to 
 contact Community Support Officers through www.gloucestershire.police.uk or by 
 emailing callcentre@gloucestershire.police.uk. The next meeting of the group is 
 scheduled for 28th November and will be held in the Watermoor area of 
 Cirencester. The actual venue has yet to be determined. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 4th September I accompanied Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb 
 to a meeting at CDC with Dr Andrea Pellegram and Kevin Field Development 
 Control Officer to discuss concerns about the imposition and enforcement of 
 planning conditions attached to granted applications. It was a very 
 enlightening meeting with Kevin Field primarily, explaining in detail the 
 reasoning behind the procedures employed. The Officers agreed to consider a 
 suggestion from Cllr Nicholas that instead of the wheel washing condition it 
 might be perspicacious to request a commuted sum to keep the road clean. Mr 
 Field explained that Mike Napper a Planning Officer in charge of many of the 
 applications considered was presently engaged in a public enquiry but would 
 attend to outstanding matters presently. Overall the PC delegation was 
 encouraged by the responses of Dr Pellegram and Mr Field. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">This afternoon I had a telephone call from Derek Sutton, 
 Bloor Homes’ Estate and Adoption Manager enquiring if the Parish Council would 
 take over the management of the public open space on Winchcombe Gardens, the 
 new development off Berkeley Close. I explained that if certain conditions 
 could be agreed it was possible that the Parish Council would consent. I asked 
 him to either make the Parish Council a monetary offer or ask how much it would 
 settle for to take over the ground maintenance. He would report back to Paul 
 Baker, Regional Survey Director at Bloor Homes, who would probably ask for a 
 meeting to discuss the business. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Stuart Milsom, our agent dealing with the sewerage 
 contractors, telephoned to enquire whether the Parish Council would be 
 interested in financial compensation or “work in kind” for the disruption 
 caused by Murphys to the Upper Up playing fields and its facilities. I advised 
 that more than likely “work in hand” would be more appealing. Mr Milsom then 
 asked if the Parish Council could draw up a “wish list” of such work and he 
 would negotiate a deal with Thames Water Ltd. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After some discussion the Parish Council agreed to such a 
 list with the following proviso. On honouring previous commitments by Thames 
 Water to dredge the open ditch in Station Road the Parish Council’s wish list 
 is as follows with no particular precedence attached. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">1. Tarmac on gravel base to provide hard standing for a 
 MUGA (multi user games area) which the Parish Council intends to provide on the 
 Upper Up playing field. 2. Tarmac on gravel base to improve the surface of the 
 car park (although there was a suggestion that a honey-combed plastic/resin 
 base sown with grass to create a hard standing for vehicle parking would be 
 considered). 3. Foot bridge over ditch to connect the footpath from Upper Up 
 towards the Cotswold Water Park at Shorncote (western end of playing field). 4. 
 A large steel builders container to house tables and chairs and other street 
 fair furniture to be placed behind the Vicarage (near the Parish Church). If 
 any of the above scheme(s) are acceptable to Thames Water the Parish Council 
 Playing Field and Village Maintenance Committee needed to be aware of the 
 specifications before work begins. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During August, of the 22 available working days, I 
 averaged 3 hours 30 minutes per day which is about par my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE
 COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 10th SEPTEMBER
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas, 
 Cllr Mrs Tunbridge and Cllr Walker attended the meeting which Cllr Caunce 
 opened at 7pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had apologised for his absence as he was off on holiday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Replacement Curfew Restriction Sign</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to remind Cotswold Sign Co Ltd that the sign was still 
 awaited. Cllr Harris reported that a replacement sign had been delivered this 
 afternoon (Wednesday) but another sign was now needed as the one remaining 
 original sign was missing. The Clerk will place a new order with the supplier. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VAS Station Road</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the vehicle sign in Station Road was not operating. 
 The Clerk had reported this to Gillian Portlock, Gloucestershire Highways five 
 days previously. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Stuart and the Clerk had met with Hilary Beach, CDC 
 Environmental Health to discuss the sewage deposit in the ditch. <i>See</i> <b>
 Clerk’s Report</b>. Cllr Nicholas will raise the question of clearing the ditch 
 with personnel from Thames Water Ltd when the Flood Forum meets on Friday 14th 
 September. Cllr Harris produced a copy of a letter (file no 28 November 2006 
 correspondence) from Thames Water Ltd stating it would remove spoil from the 
 ditch bed. Cllr Harris had accompanied Cllr Jay and inspected the plant growth 
 in the ditch. It was determined that there was nothing of exceptional botanical 
 interest and the Clerk was to ask the contractors to strim the banks as per the 
 agreed ground maintenance schedule. Cllr Harris suggested that Harry Franklin, 
 Sisters Farm, South Cerney be asked to quote for removing silt and spoil from 
 the open ditch after the contractors had cleared it. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn Bank Reinstatement</b> <br>
 No reply had been received from Chris Franklin to the Clerk’s query as to how 
 the scheme was progressing. The Clerk was asked to repeat the question. The 
 Clerk had sourced correspondence from Gloucestershire Highways which 
 acknowledged its commitment to the refurbishment. Cllr Nicholas will bring the 
 communication to a meeting of the Flood Forum and ask for an explanation for 
 the delay. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Review of Recent Floods</b> <br>
 Lady Fanshawe telephoned the Clerk in reply to his letter which enquired about 
 access to the sluice gate at Fanshawe Weir during the recent floods. <i>See</i>
 <b>Clerk’s Report</b>. Her Ladyship stated that her manager, Peter Spielberg 
 had been in contact with the Environment Agency and available throughout the 
 emergency. She explained that in times of emergency, the sluice gate is under 
 the control of the Environment Agency and Mr Spielberg operated to their 
 instructions. Cllr Nicholas will highlight the various problems encountered 
 during the crisis with members of the Environment Agency at the forthcoming 
 meeting of the Flood Forum.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that there were two brackets missing on the side panel of 
 the platform on the Adventure Unit. The 360 degree swing had been chained up to 
 prevent its use as the base within the tyre had been removed and returned 
 broken. The Clerk was asked to order a replacement from the manufacturers. 
 Grass seed laid by the Payback in the Community team was germinating on the 
 areas recently covered with top soil. Cllr Mrs Chubb had deputised for Cllr 
 Harris during weeks two and three of the period as he was on holiday.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas gave a report on the Upper Up playing fields on behalf of Cllr 
 Stuart who was on holiday. Top up sand was required on the safety surfaces. The 
 fireman’s pole on the Activity Area had been repaired. The Football Club had 
 installed a large metal store container near to their changing rooms without 
 informing the Parish Council. Use of the cycle mounds had been curtailed by 
 large deposits of spoil from the work being carried on the new sewerage 
 pipeline.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce had reported that the rubbish bin had not been emptied otherwise 
 there was no issue to report at the play area.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>UPPER UP BIKE RAMPS REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Harris and Cllr Walker had met with five 
 users of the bike ramps to discuss with them the installation of concrete 
 launch areas to facilitate the use of the installation. According to the users, 
 too much time at present was being taken up refurbishing the launch areas and a 
 solution was needed to make them more durable. Cllr Nicholas was concerned that 
 concrete could become a safety hazard but was assured that the design and 
 installation would make that unlikely. Nevertheless, it was necessary that any 
 alteration to the present design should be monitored carefully with all sharp 
 edges rounded off to minimise risk. Cllr Nicholas added that it was incumbent 
 on the Parish Council to demonstrate due diligence in its management of the 
 amenity. Cllr Mrs Chubb suggested that the GPFA be contacted for advice. Cllr 
 Harris stated that another potential scheme was the use of hard plastic and he 
 would like the users to explore this possibility. Overall, the Parish 
 Councillors attending the meeting were comfortable with the plan. Cllr Caunce 
 will arrange another meeting with the users to review the safety aspects. Cllr 
 Nicholas added at the Wednesday meeting that he was also concerned for the 
 safety of inexperienced children using the ramps unsupervised. Cllr Harris 
 suggested that a new ramp, for use by beginners could be built. The Clerk will 
 contact with GPFA for advice.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 10th 
 SEPTEMBER</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb had attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas opened the meeting at 9:12pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart had sent his apology for absence as he would be on holiday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising</b> <br>
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Webb and the Clerk had a meeting on 4th September with CDC 
 Planning Officers. <i>See</i> <b>Clerk’s Report.</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications Received by Cotswold District 
 Council</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.0108/2/A</b> <br>
 Applicant: Greatmoor Lakes Ltd, Spine Road, South Cerney <br>
 Improvements and re-development of Lake 17 including 104 holiday lodges, 
 landscaping, replacement of clubhouse and improved access of Broadway Lane at 
 Lake 17, Spine Road, South Cerney (R) <br>
 The Committee objected on behalf of the Parish Council for the following 
 reasons: 1. The number and density of the dwellings proposed in the 
 application. There are already far too many such holiday second homes in the 
 parish – literally hundreds! 2. The Parish Council remains very concerned that 
 the public main sewerage infrastructure in South Cerney must first be proven to 
 be capable of accommodating the additional volumes that will be created by this 
 and other impending developments in the area. 3. It is concerned about the 
 likely piecemeal nature of the proposed development: “one-by-one replacement of 
 caravans” would result in the site being partially redeveloped over many years. 
 4. It is also concerned about precisely what material will be used for the 
 dwellings, and how this will impact visually, having regard to the contemporary 
 nature of the design. <br>
 Cllr Aram (CDC) in response to an observation from Cllr Harris, about the 
 increasing amount of holiday homes being erected in the area, stated that 
 currently she was studying the details of the Local Plan 2007–2011. There was a 
 statement in the document which precluded any more development of holiday 
 lodges in our area but through various means this objective was being eroded. 
 She would investigate further and would keep the Parish Council informed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Jay 
 that the Parish Council ratifies the decision of the Planning Committee. The 
 Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas declared a prejudicial interest in the next 
 application as the applicant was a friend of his and left the room. Cllr Webb 
 took over as Chairman for this item.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.1498/C</b> <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">After some discussion Cllr Webb called for a vote. It was 
 proposed by Cllr Caunce and seconded by Cllr Walker that the Parish Council 
 does not object to this application. Eight voted in favour and one against. The 
 motion was therefore carried. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">NO OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas returned to the room and resumed as Chairman 
 of the Committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planning Applications Granted by Cotswold District

 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9.45pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FLOOD PREVENTION</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay reiterated that the Parish Council had no 
 facility to provide direct assistance in times of flooding. Advice on where to 
 get help would, of course, be given but generally it was up to individuals to 
 protect their properties. Cllr Nicholas stated that the main objects were the 
 dredging of the river Churn through Bow Wow and solving the Clarks Hay problem. 
 Cllr Harris highlighted the drain or small stream which ran through Franklin’s 
 property in Bow Wow which he considered to be badly maintained and a probable 
 cause of recent flooding. Cllr Nicholas will enquire, at the next meeting of 
 the Flood Forum on Friday 14th September, from representatives of the 
 Environment Agency if a roadshow was available to promote awareness for 
 residents.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>2007 RISK ASSESSMENT </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay proposed and Cllr Harris seconded a motion that 
 the Parish Council adopts the conclusions and recommendations of the 2007 risk 
 assessment. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>GLOUCESTERSHIRE HIGHWAYS PROPOSED STREET LIGHTING PLAN</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Parish Council agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Jay 
 that wider consultation was necessary before a reasoned response could be made. 
 When Cllr Webb argued that the costs of the proposed changes were not 
 justifiable, Cllr Nicholas pointed out that the Parish Council had previously 
 voted in favour of the outline plan. Cllr Jay stated that the Parish Council 
 was here to discuss which lights operated and which could be could be left off 
 through the period. The Parish Council agreed that a consultation be arranged 
 to be held in the Village Hall to ascertain the thoughts of residents. Cllr Jay 
 volunteered to attend and the Clerk will book the venue for early October. Cllr 
 Walker requested that Col. McKend, Commanding Officer at Gloucester Barracks be 
 sent a copy of the map and correspondence as security patrols from the camp 
 regularly used the village especially through the hours of darkness. This was 
 agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TRI-SERVICE EMERGENCY CENTRE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Jay 
 that the Parish Council supports a petition to the Prime Minister to 
 acknowledge the vital role played by Gloucestershire’s TriService Emergency 
 Centre in co-ordinating the response to recent flooding in the county. We call 
 upon the Prime Minister to scrap plans to remove the county’s 999 Fire Control 
 from the TriService Centre and relocate it to the Regional Fire Control at 
 Taunton, Somerset. A discussion ensued on the benefits of a local service as 
 opposed to one at a more remote location. Cllr Nicholas said that he was 
 reliably informed that the TriService operation was considered a success by 
 those involved although the trend overall was for a service with less 
 availability. Cllr Webb opposed the report that the TriService operated 
 successfully during the recent flood crisis. This was not the case he said, as 
 accounts of the backlog of unanswered 999 calls demonstrated and urgent 
 messages being transmitted by fax communications. Modern technology provides 
 enough expertise to manage the emergency services through the region. Cllr Webb 
 approved the plan to introduce a new system for control from Taunton. The 
 system works well in Wales he argued. Cllr Nicholas ended the debate saying 
 that the Parish Council would have to accept that it had limited knowledge on 
 the fitness or disadvantage of the operation or the consequences of moving the 
 control centre and called for a vote on the motion. Nine Parish Councillors 
 were in favour of the petition and one voted against. The motion was therefore 
 carried.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PERSISTENT ABSENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker proposed and Cllr Jay seconded a motion that 
 this Parish Council accepts Cllr Walker’s statutory excuse for persistent 
 absence, due to duty in the service of Her Majesty, as promulgated in the Local 
 Government Act 1972 s.85(3). The Act stated: “A member of any branch of Her 
 Majesty’s naval, military or air forces when employed during war or any 
 emergency on any naval, military or air force service, and a person whose 
 employment in the service of Her Majesty in connection with war or any 
 emergency is such as, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, to entitle him 
 to relief from disqualification on account of absence, shall not cease to be a 
 member of a local authority by reason only of a failure to attend meetings of 
 the local authority [or of a failure to attend meetings of the executive] if 
 the failure is due to that employment.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas explained the provision of the exception 
 regarding the absence of Cllr Walker when his duty in Iraq, due to 
 circumstances beyond his control, would mean he would miss six and possibly 
 more meetings. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker accepted the invitation to leave the room as 
 he would have a prejudicial interest in the proceedings. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The support and solidarity of the Parish Council for Cllr 
 Walker was stated by Cllr Jay and approved unanimously. It was proposed by Cllr 
 Jay and seconded by Cllr Webb that the Parish Council accepts the reason for 
 Cllr Walker’s absence as perfectly justifiable throughout the duration of his 
 secondment to Iraq. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Walker returned to the room.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS' REPORTS</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Messenger (CDC) left a series of documents regarding 
 the future plans for the protection of historical structures on the Severn &amp; 
 Thames Canal (Coates to Lechlade) and requested that Parish Councillors 
 acquaint themselves with the content. He asked that the Parish Council 
 considers supporting the plan and would welcome comments, critical or otherwise 
 on the aims outlined, to be made at the next meeting of the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb gave a brief report on the meeting of the 
 Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee he had attended on 27th July, part of which 
 discussed the Cotswold Water Park Strategic Review and Implementation Plan. He 
 highlighted a proposal in a recent planning application, for the permission to 
 create a depository for inert waste which could affect Cricklade, Latton and 
 therefore possibly Cerney Wick. Policy in Wiltshire was in favour of infilling 
 redundant pits to eventually create farm land rather than creating lakes. On 
 the 26th September a workshop will be held at the Gateway Centre to formulate 
 ideas and options for developing the future of the Cotswold Water Park hosted 
 by Scott Wilson. This will be part of the Master Planning Process the purpose 
 of which is to ensure that change, which will occur as extraction continues, 
 happens in a structured and co-ordinated manner.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb further commented on the dangerous state of the 
 surface of the highway through the built up area of Broadway Lane. There were 
 more and more complaints from residents and something must be done sooner 
 rather than later although he was aware that the recent floods in other parts 
 of the county might forestall any action. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Other residents from the eastern part of the village were 
 complaining about the malodorous stench which emanated from the drains from 
 time to time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay stated that the South Cerney Trust had been 
 unsuccessful in a recent bid for funds from the CDC as the application did not 
 satisfy the criteria. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris asked for permission to attend a conference 
 for tree wardens. There was a small charge for refreshment included. The Parish 
 Council had no objection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman asked the Clerk to inform Mr Taffinder 
 that hedges on his land used by South Cerney Riding School needed to be cut 
 back. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ITEMS FOR INCLUSION IN CERNEY NEWS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">1. Lighting consultation </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">2. Cycling on footpaths </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">3. PCSO email contact address </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">4. Closure of the bridleway on the old railway line </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business, Cllr Nicholas closed the 
 meeting at 10:02pm.</p>
