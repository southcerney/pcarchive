    <p align="left">The meeting began at 7pm when the Chairman, Cllr M. Stuart 
    welcomed Claire Dowan, CDC Youth Co-ordinator. Claire informed the assembled 
    Parish Councillors that the Youth Parish Council had been up and running for 
    a year and was proving successful and spoken about favourably by members of 
    the Cotswold District Council. During a brief appraisal of its activities 
    she highlighted the evaluation training which had taken place over a 4 week 
    period in 1 hour sessions. This helped to produce an action plan to take the 
    group forward for the next 4 months. Other schemes included how to write 
    press releases and how to deal with positive and negative scenarios. 
    Achievements by the YPC included the charity Fun Run organised for all ages 
    which took place on the Upper Up playing fields and gave an insight into the 
    associated problems of such an event, for example the Risk Assessment. It 
    was a huge learning process for members of the YPC and a very valuable 
    experience in organising a public event. An innovative idea was the 
    provision of grant funding to other youth groups in the community through a 
    “Funding Application Form” which had been designed. The position of Clerk in 
    the organisation had been split into two with a member selected to take the 
    minutes and another to action business and communication. Cllr Nicholas 
    admired the prudent way the group handled its finances and suspected that 
    the members njoyed the whole procedure. He praised Claire Dowan whom, he 
    stated, had handled the group brilliantly. Parish Councillors at the meeting 
    all agreed. Cllr Nicholas went on to say that a practical way to involve the 
    YPC would be to include them in the planning for the MUGA (Multi User Games 
    Area). Cllr Jay said that the Parish Council must be prepared to accept the 
    limitations of the group. He argued that South Cerney must demand equal 
    status with communities of similar size suggesting that when compared to 
    Fairford and Lechlade the village was not getting its fair share. He 
    emphasised the youthful make up of South Cerney stating that according to 
    recent statistics there were 400 in the 11-19 year old group and there was 
    precious little local infrastructure provided for this group in South 
    Cerney. Proximity to Cirencester should not be a barrier for the provision 
    of facilities in the village. Cllr Nicholas appealed that professional 
    advice be available on how to approach and interact with youth. Claire Dowan 
    would facilitate his request. Cllr Caunce would like to see the YPC 
    encouraged to spend more of its budget. The meeting then focused on the 
    forthcoming preparations for the Big Lottery Fund bid and how the District 
    Council was planning to develop a play strategy to access the potential 
    £200k ring fenced for such activity. Claire Dowan stated that suggested 
    schemes from the 450 square mile area comprising the District are being 
    evaluated. Strict criteria have been imposed but funds would be available 
    for goal ends, basket ball areas and similar schemes. Projects must be able 
    to “go” in 6 to 12 months and Parish and Town Councils must take 
    responsibility of any installations given a grant. Match funding would also 
    play a part. Claire Down then left the meeting.</p>

 The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the meeting at 7.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">PCSO Lesley Pooley and PCSO Tracy Garcia-Cote attended.

 <p>Cllr S. Walker apologised for his absence as he was on duty and unable to 
 attend. Cllr C. Bennett (CDC) had made an apology as he was on vacation, Cllr

 9th May 2007</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Page 2250 – 1st paragraph, 3rd line: delete stumps … 
 insert trunks <br>
 It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Minutes, as 
 amended, were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council was all in favour 
 and Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">No member of the YPC attended. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart welcomed PCSOs L. Pooley and T. Garcia-Cote to 
 the meeting. PCSO Pooley introduced her companion whom she explained was being 
 trained as a PCSO. Cllr Nicholas enquired if a curfew was imposed on the 
 playing fields could it be enforced? PCSO Pooley would ask her superior 
 Inspector Steve Williams for his opinion. Cllr Stuart informed her that he 
 would be attending the next meeting of the Safer Cotswolds Forum on Thursday 
 12th July where he would raise the question. Cllr Harris explained that the 
 notice restricting access to the Robert Franklin Way play area was in the form 
 of a polite request which gave some authority to control noisy behaviour after 
 10pm but a byelaw could be enforced by statute. Cllr Harris alleged that the 
 behaviour of a group of youths from outside the village was leading to 
 potential trouble. PCSO Pooley said that she was aware and monitoring the 
 situation. Cllr Mrs Land thanked PCSO Pooley for her quick response and 
 reaction to unsavoury instances which she had reported happening in Berkeley 
 Close. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">PCSO Pooley gave a report on reported crime in the area 
 from the beginning of May until 12th June. Out of 12 recorded crimes three had 
 been detected to date which can be compared to the same period last year when 
 there were 39 recorded crimes with five being detected. Crime could be broken 
 down into five categories – Burglaries (Commercial and Domestic): two, with 
 none being detected yet; Violent Crime: two, with one detected; Drug Offences: 
 None; Criminal Damage Offences: None. Theft Offences: 8, with one detected. 
 Total reported crime was 12 with three being detected compared to last year 
 over the same period when there were 39 reported crimes and 5 detected which is 
 a decrease on the previous year and largely accounted by the fact that the 
 community has begun to give information on offenders to the police, thus 
 deterring offenders. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">After making the report the Chairman enquired if the PCSOs 
 could inform the Parish Council before coming to a meeting so that they could 
 be included in the agenda. Every effort would be made to promote their 
 attendance as it was appreciated that their duty was of paramount 
 consideration. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Both PCSOs then left the meeting at 7.50pm to continue 
 their patrol.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb informed the meeting that Mr Tony Squire would 
 be attending a meeting of the Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee that evening 
 and would raise the problem of the state of the car park opposite Spring Lake. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas explained that the Revised Model Code of 
 Conduct for Parish Councillors had come into force on 3rd May. Cllr Jay stated 
 that it was a massive improvement on its predecessor. Cllr Nicholas commended 
 its adoption to members of the Parish Council. Cllr Nicholas proposed and Cllr 
 Jay seconded a motion that the Parish Council adopts the revised Code of 
 Conduct for all its members. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was asked to contact Nigel Adams, CDC Monitoring 
 Officer regarding on how to proceed in recording Declarations of Interest for 
 new and existing Parish Councillors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>HOUSING NEEDS SURVEY</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas explained that the information was now to be 
 presented as statistical and not specific which was acceptable. It was proposed 
 by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Caunce that the Parish Council agrees to 
 the publication of the Housing Needs Survey excluding confidential financial 
 information. The Parish Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I collected a change of signatory document from 
 Lloyds/TSB, removed the two ex-councillors and inserted Cllr Mrs Land as a 
 replacement. Any two of the signatories must sign to validate and the Clerk is 
 empowered to deposit funds in both accounts and transfer funds from the deposit 
 to the current account. Councillors entitled to sign are: Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr 
 Jay, Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Webb. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 15th May I attended the RIAT briefing at RAF 
 Fairford. The Air Show will take place on the Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th 
 July. The theme this year will be the 60th anniversary of the USAF and the 
 highlight of the show will be a flying display by the Thunderbirds which is the 
 top USAF display team. For those interested it will be a rare opportunity to 
 see this team perform outside the United States. Overall, a maximum of 300 
 aircraft will partake in the gala which is approximately 200 less than the 
 maximum. Last year there was 167,000 in attendance which is approaching the 
 records set pre-Nine Eleven. The various traffic routes were explained with the 
 closest to South Cerney being the “Brown” route which will take traffic from 
 the south and west after leaving M4 junction 17 to the B4696 Spine Road and 
 merging with the “Green” route from the M5 to the A417/A419 to the “Green” car 
 park area. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Wednesday 16th I attended the Annual Parish Meeting of 
 the Parish Council in the Village Hall.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Hilary Beech (CDC) informed me that the District Council 
 had no plans to supply dog fouling bins or signs. There were already 300 plus 
 throughout the district which was considered sufficient. Two new environment 
 wardens will shortly be appointed and dog fouling will be on their agenda. If 
 the Parish Council wishes to install such signs and receptacles the District 
 Council will arrange for the bins to be emptied if a map describing their 
 location is made available. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Notice of the start of the audit inspection period has 
 been displayed on the notice board. By law any one entitled and registered to 
 vote in local elections has the right to inspect the accounts and supporting 
 documents. The inspection period will last for 20 working days and is from 
 Monday 4th until Friday 29th June inclusive. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">So that there will be no confusion I would remind all 
 Parish Councillors that the dates for the meetings in August are as follows. 
 Committee meetings take place on 6th and the Parish Council meets on the 8th. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During May, of the 22 available working days, I averaged 3 
 hours 25 minutes per day which is par for my contract. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING FROM ANNUAL PARISH MEETING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There were no matters arising.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
 </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reported on the discussions of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 11th June. Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Stuart had attended the meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk opened the meeting at 7pm and enquired if a 
 member was willing to stand as Chairman of the committee. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Chairman</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Stuart 
 that Cllr Caunce be elected as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee. Cllr Caunce accepted the nomination. <br>
 The Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce chaired the remainder of the meeting </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Election of Vice Chairman</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Harris and seconded by Cllr Mrs 
 Chubb that Cllr Stuart be elected as Vice Chairman of the Playing Fields and 
 Village Maintenance Committee. Cllr Stuart accepted the nomination. The 
 Committee was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apologies</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had made an apology for her absence as 
 she would be away on a school trip. Cllr Walker had sent a sincere apology for 
 his absence as he was on duty and unable to attend.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Stop Signs</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris informed the Committee that the bus stop sign 
 on the Spine Road near to the entrance to the Education pit had been repaired. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that she had been informed by Mrs 
 Margaret Gardiner that Jonathan Roberts Gloucestershire Highways (01452 425628) 
 had promised speedy action to repair the broken bus stop sign in Station Road. 
 The post was now upright although there was no information flag at the top. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Station Road Ditch</b> <br>
 Despite reassurances from Thames Water that either the work had been completed 
 or would be completed no action had yet been taken by them to clean out the 
 ditch. The Clerk was asked, yet again, to remind Thames Water it had been 
 agreed that, following the sewerage pipe fractures and the consequent ingress 
 of sewage into the drain, Thames Water undertook to remove the polluted sludge 
 with a digger and bucket attached over the full length of the open ditch in 
 Station Road. Vegetation now obscured the polluted sludge but the problem 
 remained, albeit hidden beneath the new growth.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Advertising Signs Station Road/Spine Road/Cerney Wick 
 Lane crossroads</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris was disappointed with the report from Michael Grace, CDC 
 Enforcement Officer regarding the display of advertisements at the crossroads. 
 Cllr Nicholas advised that as the item was on the Planning Committee’s agenda 
 he would suggest that a proper audit of the permissions granted be carried out 
 to determine which advertisements had been agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Curfew Signs at Robert Franklin Way play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that the new signs restricting access to the play area had 
 been erected. Residents living close by were generally in favour of the new 
 arrangement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Big Lottery Fund Bid</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce and Cllr Stuart volunteered to attend a meeting at CDC on Friday 
 22nd June at 1.15pm to discuss plans to promote a bid for the funding of play 
 resources throughout the Cotswold District.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damaged Manhole Cover (outside “Content”) <br>
 </b>Thames Water replied to a request to repair the damaged manhole cover 
 outside “Content” in Station Road alleging that the cover was in the ownership 
 of the occupants. The Clerk was asked to inform the Revd J. Lugg that the 
 Parish Council considered the state of the manhole cover to be dangerous and 
 steps should be taken to affect its repair. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damaged Manhole Cover (outside “Londis”)</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to inform the Environmental Health at CDC about a broken 
 manhole cover outside the entrance to the flat at the Londis store in Broadway 
 Lane. The Parish Council is concerned with the potential health hazard and the 
 proximity of a food outlet. <br>
 The Clerk was asked to report another broken grille behind the public seat at 
 the corner of Berkeley Close and Broadway Lane, on the grass triangle opposite 
 Londis store. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resiting of public seat at Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris would install the seat in the near future. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tower Slide Reinstatement</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that he was experiencing some difficulty, for various 
 reasons, in contacting Steve Hanson, Pay Back in the Community supervisor in 
 arranging for the soil and reseeding of the area on which the Tower Slide had 
 stood on Robert Franklin Way play area. He hoped that the situation would be 
 resolved shortly. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fenplay Surface</b> <br>
 The Clerk was asked to enquire from George Taylor, safety surface contractor, 
 which particular type of sand was needed to refurbish the Fenplay surface. Mr 
 Taylor had emailed a reply stating the sand needed was Garside 2 EW. It was 
 vital that this is used as it is rounded and non-staining. Mr Taylor can supply 
 it to order in 25kg bags although the more sand in the surface the more 
 difficult it becomes to vandalise. The repair is best made professionally and 
 if a photograph of the damage and more information was available he would be 
 able to offer a precise quote. A very rough estimate would be £275.00–£350.00 
 subject to the above. It was agreed by the Parish Council that Mr Taylor be 
 asked to quote and this would be evaluated at next month’s committee meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BSC21 (opposite Education Lake)</b> <br>
 Mike Barton PROW officer at Gloucestershire County Council had inspected the 
 erosion of the river Churn bank and the adjacent path. Although the erosion is 
 a potential problem there is no need for immediate action. The contractor has 
 been requested to ensure that the path is cleared right up to the mesh fence so 
 that people can keep away from the edge of the bank. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Replacement Dog Bin</b> <br>
 The Clerk reported that Hilary Beech, CDC Dog Warden informed him that no new 
 dog bins would be installed. The Committee pointed out that it was a 
 replacement bin which was needed and asked the Clerk to inform her accordingly. 
 The worn out bin was near to the stone bridge at the beginning of Bow Wow, near 
 the Old George public house. The Clerk reported that after informing Hilary 
 Beech that the bin had worn out she agreed to replace it. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that two sections of timber are 
 missing from the Activity Area. Specifically the top rung of the ladder and the 
 end plank of the top walkway both need to be renewed. The Clerk had contacted 
 R.O.W. Berry who had quoted £55 to carry out the repairs. The Parish Council 
 agreed. The Fenplay safety surface needed attention in places. Cllr Harris and 
 Cllr Stuart will inspect the damage and report their findings to the Parish 
 Council (see previous item: Fenplay Surface). The Tennis Club pavilion has not 
 yet been repaired. The Clerk was asked to inform the Tennis Club Secretary, 
 Sheila Dickson that the Parish Council is concerned. Litter problem needs 
 attention. Replacement signs informing users of the play area where the nearest 
 telephone and hospital facilities could be found had been supplied by the 
 Clerk. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris did not have his report at the committee 
 meeting and made it at the Parish Council. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris invited Parish Councillors to inspect the 
 Train and Adventure units in the toddlers play area as he had detected rot to 
 the floors and steps of the equipment. The ring latches on the fencing gate 
 needed to be replaced. On the play equipment Cllr Harris reported that a plank 
 had been broken on the Hags play unit and a post of the Goal Posts needed to be 
 moved. A rail on the Lakeside boundary needed to be replaced and top soil was 
 required on the site of the old Tower slide. One limb on a tree needed to be 
 removed from the site and the resulting scar cleaned. Cllr Harris then costed 
 the work needed, offered his services and after declaring a prejudicial 
 interest left the room while the rest of the Parish Council discussed his 
 quotations. It was agreed that the three jobs in total costing £55: sawing off 
 the broken plank to level with sides, replacing the rail on the boundary fence 
 and servicing the tree limb which had broken off represented excellent value 
 for money and accepted the quotation. Cllr Harris returned to the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the installed play equipment was all in order. 
 Replacement signs informing users about the rule on dogs’ non-access and 
 nearest telephone and hospital facilities had been supplied by the Clerk. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BSC7 Permissive Path</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart noted that sewage contractors are using the playing field to access 
 the new pipeline works and have laid a temporary roadway from the car park to 
 the pipeline. Moore Allen &amp; Innocent are fully aware and will negotiate 
 suitable compensation in due course. A probable outcome could be that Murphy 
 (Contractors) will reinstate the car park at Upper Up and install a foot bridge 
 from the playing field to Earl Bathurst’s land thereby creating a permissive 
 path to link up with the overall plan to create a route to the Cotswold Water 
 Park facility at Keynes Park. Discussions with the Environment Agency 
 ascertained that it was not in favour of rounded pipes but preferred square box 
 section type to act as a bridge. A possible compromise would be to use 
 supported tannalised sawn timber as a bridge.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>South Cerney Trust Concerns</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Peter Jay on behalf of the South Cerney Trust had emailed 
 its concern about Japanese Knot Weed, an overgrowing oak tree and public seat 
 in the vicinity of the river Churn bridge at Clarks Hay and Silver Street. Mr 
 Jay also reported that the fence at Robert Franklin Way play area was damaged. 
 The Committee concurred that the Environment Agency had previously been 
 informed and agreed that the problem was not getting any worse. There was a 
 difficulty in applying chemical to control the weed with the proximity of the 
 water course. Cllr Harris had removed some protruding branches from the oak 
 tree, albeit that it was not in the ownership of the Parish Council. Mr Jay’s 
 suggestion that an audit of all public seats is carried out was agreed but no 
 decision was taken on who should take responsibility. Cllr Caunce will 
 accompany Cllr Stuart and the Tree Wardens, Cllr Harris and Cllr Webb to carry 
 out an audit of the public seats within the Parish. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Notice Board at Limes</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the surface of the notice board was peeling away in 
 places. The Clerk will contact R.O.W. Berry and ask him to make the necessary 
 repairs. R.O.W. Berry reported that the notice board was beyond repair and 
 needed to be replaced. The Clerk had asked him to quote for building a new one. 
 Alternatively, a bespoke one could be purchased. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Village Sign</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the large sign at the entrance to the village at 
 Upper Up had been removed. The Clerk was asked to report the incident to 
 Gloucestershire Highways who had forwarded the report to its Gloucester office 
 for action. Preferably it was agreed that the sign should be replaced with a 
 resin version rather than a metal one to dissuade thieves. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wildmoorway Lane <br>
 </b>Cllr Stuart reported that Mike Barton emailed to say that the long term aim 
 is to clear out the ditch on the bund side and cut the vegetation right back. 
 The Environment Agency prefers to wait for the promised Flood Plan from 
 Watermark to appear before it takes a decision. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing Hedges obscuring road signs</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce asked the Clerk to inform Gillian Portlock, 
 Gloucestershire Highways that the 30 mph speed limit signs on the lane entering 
 the hamlet of Cerney Wick from Latton/Down Ampney direction were obscured by 
 overgrowing branches. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb reported that the “Give Way” road signs at the 
 Broadway Lane/Spine Road junction were also obscured by overgrowing hedges. The 
 Clerk will inform the authority. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>River Churn bank reinstatement <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris asked the Clerk to enquire from Gloucestershire Highways on how 
 the engineers’ survey of the river bank was progressing. Jennifer Watkins, 
 Gloucestershire Highways Senior Highway Representative had emailed a reply 
 stating that discussions were in progress with the Environment Agency as the 
 water course was a main river. A meeting has been arranged for 21st June on 
 site to resolve the problem. After that Ms Watkins should be in a position to 
 progress the matter and will update the Parish Council thereafter. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>War Memorial Chain</b> <br>
 Cllr Harris reported that one of the links in the chain around the War Memorial 
 had broken. The Committee agreed to instruct James Harris Contracting to make 
 the repair. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Stop Sign at Berkeley Close/Broadway Lane</b> <br>
 Cllr Webb reminded the Committee that it had been agreed to change the sign at 
 this junction from a “Give Way” to a “Stop”. The Clerk will enquire from 
 Gloucestershire Highways as to when this might be expected. A reply from Martyn 
 Midgley, Gloucestershire Highways Area Programme Manager explained that the 
 scheme to replace the signs had been discounted. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb had enquired why Condition 7 had not been 
 implemented. Condition 7: No dwelling hereby permitted shall be occupied until 
 Berkeley Close is subject to a prohibition of driving order under the Road 
 Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and the associated road works as submitted have 
 been completed to the satisfaction of the Local Highway Authority. Reason: In 
 the interests of highway safety in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan 
 Policy 46 and PPG13. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In an emailed reply Michael Grace CDC Enforcement Officer 
 stated: “I have spoken to Bloor Homes concerning the prohibition of driving 
 order. The person dealing with the matter no longer works for the company. 
 However, as I understand it, the details have been agreed between Bloor Homes 
 and Gloucestershire County Council and the necessary public consultations have 
 been completed. I am expecting written confirmation that it is in the Bloor 
 Homes planned scheme of work.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land had enquired which Conditions applied to the 
 public open space within the development. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Condition 13 states: Prior to the development being 
 brought into use, the public open space illustrated in drawing TE04-21(E) shall 
 be permanently provided and equipped, including provision for long-term 
 management and maintenance, in accordance with details to be submitted to and 
 approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Reason: To ensure the 
 permanent provision of the public open space in accordance with Cotswold 
 District Local Plan Policies 1 and 45, and PPS1 and PPG17. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk had asked the Enforcement Officer at CDC to 
 investigate the non-compliance of this Condition and to provide the Parish 
 Council with a copy of the details submitted by Bloor Homes Ltd</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">In an emailed reply Michael Grace CDC Enforcement Officer 
 stated: “As noted in my letter of 14th August 2006, Condition 13 of CT.2443/P 
 has been superseded by a Legal Agreement attached to CT.2443/Q. Therefore there 
 are no submitted details. However a landscaping scheme has been incorporated 
 into the Legal Agreement. This includes a public open space to be administered 
 for 12 months by the developer and then passed to South Cerney Parish Council. 
 As the Parish Council is a signatory to the agreement I assume that the Council 
 will have seen the plans of the scheme. I can find no record on our files of 
 the agreement being signed. I will follow this up with our Legal Department.”</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Nicholas pointed out that CT.2443/P was an 
 application for 23 dwellings and CT.2443/Q was for 5 and one application did 
 not supersede the other. Further the Parish Council was not a signatory to any 
 agreement with Bloor Homes but had been involved in negotiations which had not 
 been concluded. The Clerk will inform Michael Grace, CDC Enforcement Officer. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CT.2648/3/R and CT.2648/3/S</b> <br>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb enquired why Condition 23 of CT.2648/3/R and 
 Condition 6 of CT.2648/3/S are not being applied. Both conditions state: Prior 
 to the commencement of development wheel wash facilities shall be provided on 
 site in accordance with details to be submitted to and approved in writing by 
 the Local Planning Authority. The facilities shall then be installed and 
 maintained for the duration of the development in accordance with the approved 
 details. All vehicles shall use the facilities prior to their exit from the 
 site. Reason: to ensure that mud and earth deposits are not brought onto the 
 public highway in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Cotswold 
 District Local Plan Policy 38.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mr Colin Davies, CDC Enforcement had emailed the following 
 in return to a query from the Clerk: “I must say that I am a little surprised 
 to receive your e-mail as I had understood that I had fully explained the 
 current situation regarding the wheel wash facility at Lake 11 to your Council, 
 or should I say the lack of, on a number of occasions. The letter I sent your 
 Council on the 31/10/06 as well as subsequent e-mails lay out the position.” </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Advertising at Spine Road, Station Road, Cerney Wick

 Cllr Webb agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Nicholas to carry out an audit of 
 the granted applications regarding advertising in the vicinity of the Spine

 agenda for its meeting next month. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed
