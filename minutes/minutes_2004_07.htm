    The Chairman Cllr Stuart opened the Parish Council meeting at 7.30 pm.<br>
    <br>
    <b>APOLOGIES</b><br>
    Apologies for their absence had been received from Cllr Caunce and Cllr 
    Baines (CDC).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON 9 JUNE 2004</b><br>
    Page 1842: CT.0144/4/T – penultimate line: delete “object” insert: refuse<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Mrs Chapman and seconded by Cllr Mrs Pollard that 
    the Minutes as altered were a true and accurate record. The Parish Council 
    was all in favour. Chairman Cllr Stuart signed the Minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>MATTERS ARISING</b><br>
    Matters arising would be dealt within Committees’ deliberations.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>CLERK’S REPORT</b><br>
    I attended to Parish Council business and met with the Chairman to discuss 
    minor events. During the month the Parish Council’s part of the noticeboard 
    in Clark’s Hay received damage as a result of a storm but I was able to 
    reinstate it and replace the missing notices. Notification of residents’ 
    rights to inspect the accounts was posted in accordance with Audit 
    Commission Act 1998 and the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003. Electors 
    are given 14 days notice of their right to inspect the accounts. Under the 
    new regulations the inspection period has been increased from 15 to 20 
    working days and this period will be from 14 July until 11 August.<br>
    <br>
    In June of the 22 available working days I averaged 3 hrs 10 mins per day 
    which is less than the 3 hrs 36 mins my contract allows.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; PLAYING FIELDS</b><br>
    Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Village Maintenance &amp; 
    Playing Fields Committee which had met on 12 July.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Ham Lane/Sudeley Drive Ramp</b><br>
    The Clerk reported that correspondence sent by recorded delivery had been 
    returned annotated “Return to Sender”. Phil Cluley PROW had advised that Ham 
    Lane was not a definitive path and GCC Highways should be consulted. The 
    Clerk was to write to Mrs G. Portlock, GCC Highways Area Supervisor for help 
    and guidance on how to proceed to create a ramp to access Ham Lane through 
    Sudeley Drive.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Footpath/Bridleway Work</b><br>
    Cllr Squire will ask the installing team to adjust the gate at the Church 
    Lane end of the path which leads to Bow Wow. All three gates are now 
    installed. Phil Cluley had asked that the Parish Council supply the “as dug” 
    gravel and edging boards for the path. The Finance Committee had agreed to 
    recommend that a request for a maximum of £500 should be allocated to this 
    scheme. The Parish Council agreed. The Clerk was asked to write to Mr Cluley 
    informing him of this decision and that the Church Warden would permit the 
    spoil to be left in the new area of the churchyard.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Village Plan</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart is still working on the plan and will call a meeting of the sub 
    committee when ready.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b><br>
    <b>Upper Up play area</b><br>
    Cllr Stuart reported that there was a continuing problem with the safety 
    tiles although the situation was no worse than previous. The back board of 
    the basketball net will need to be repainted in the next year. The Clerk was 
    asked to obtain quotations to cut and strim the weeds and herbage on the 
    cycle mounds and all areas inaccessible to the normal cut. Drainage work has 
    been completed by the contractor but it will be necessary to await heavy 
    rain to see if the job is satisfactory. Camping is taking place by the pond 
    on some nights. Cllr Harris has spoken to some of the youngsters involved 
    and Parish Councillors should be on the lookout for this behaviour. 
    Photographs of the access to the tower slide had been sent to Julie Tegg at 
    GPFA who would report shortly if there was a solution to making the 
    apparatus more user friendly to smaller children. Cllr Stuart reported that 
    the basketball board supporting post had been bent about 15 degrees after 
    the meeting on Monday evening but that the youths responsible had been 
    reported to the police. Cllr Stuart was verbally abused when he stopped the 
    rider of a motorbike trials bike from using the Upper Up field and jumps. He 
    asked that a sign be prepared stating that no unauthorised motorcycles or 
    power driven vehicles be allowed on to the playing fields. He also asked 
    that a copy of the byelaws relating to the use of the playing fields be 
    displayed in a prominent position.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Robert Franklin Way play area</b><br>
    Cllr Harris reported that the 360 degree swing was still inoperable and the 
    safety surface beneath the swing needed to be relaid as some damage had been 
    caused by the grass cutting contractor. The bridge on the adventure unit in 
    the toddlers play area needed to be tightened. The bottle screws had become 
    undone as the clamps had not been tight enough when originally fitted. The 
    Clerk informed the Committee that Steve Griffiths of Macventure Play Co had 
    a solution for the repair of the swing but had requested payment of the 
    outstanding £1,000. The Clerk was asked to inform him that payment would be 
    made when the contract was satisfactorily completed. Cllr Harris reported 
    that the proposed new gate had not yet been fitted and the high fence on the 
    Lakeside boundary still needed to be repaired. Cllr Squire had informed A&amp;B 
    Fencing Ltd. The old concrete seat had been taken away and the other seat 
    moved. The fence on the Lakeside needed to be replaced and the chain link 
    mounted on the field side, not the road side.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Cerney Wick play area</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the broken fence had not yet been repaired. 
    She would inform the Chairperson of the Cerney Wick Village Hall Committee. 
    The rest of the play area was in good order.<br>
    <br>
    <b>New Litter Bins</b><br>
    The Clerk was to ask CDC to either increase the capacity of the bins or 
    their number at Londis, next to the Noticeboard in Clarks Hay, Upper Up car 
    park and the Churchyard.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Entrance to Lake 16 (CT.0006/3/V)</b><br>
    The Clerk had contacted the Enforcement Officer at CDC after Cllr Webb asked 
    that he report a breach of Condition 9. Mr Grace confirmed that permission 
    had been granted by the County Council to access the site from the Spine 
    Road and he would shortly forward a copy of the letter authorising this. 
    Cllr Webb remarked that vehicles leaving the site were no longer abiding by 
    the Condition requiring them to have their wheels washed. Cllr S. Parsons (GCC) 
    recommended that the Enforcement Officer at the County Council be informed. 
    The Clerk will write to Sara Scrivens GCC Development Co-Ordination officer 
    at Shire Hall.<br>

    PLANNING<br>
    Cllr Nicholas reported on the deliberations of the Planning Committee which 
    had met on 12 July.<br>
    <b>Matters Arising</b><br>
    <b>Westbury Homes</b><br>
    The Clerk had been informed that the Enforcement Officer at CDC would be 
    recommending to the Planning Committee at CDC that Westbury Homes be 
    prosecuted under section 187a sub section 9 of the Planning Act 1990 for

    NO COMMENT<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0144/4/V</b><br>
    Applicant: Mr J. Hartshorne, 37 Oak Way, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. 
    GL7 5XX<br>
    Erection of single storey garden room extension on land adjacent to Hailwood, 
    Station Road, South Cerney, Cirencester, Glos. (R)<br>
    The proposed ground floor windows in the west elevation of the ‘garden room’ 
    would be unduly intrusive on the privacy of the adjoining dwelling.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish 
    Council ratifies the decision of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council 
    was all in favour.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.0650/E</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Pollard declared an interest as a close neighbour and left the 
    Committee room while this item was being discussed.<br>
    <b>Estate of the late Miss Grace Johnson</b><br>
    Conversion of existing building to two (2) dwellings and erection of four 
    (4) dwellings and carports at Old Post Office, High Street, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    It is the view of the Committee that the car ports are not in keeping with 
    the local style and should be abandoned. The wide verge needs to be of an 
    appropriate design to complement the grass verges on either side.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Chubb that the Parish 
    Council approves the recommendation of the Planning Committee. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>
    NO OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.1756/E</b><br>
    Cllr Mrs Chapman declared a prejudicial interest as the mother of the 
    applicant and left the Committee room while this item was being discussed.<br>

    Erection of single storey outbuilding at Deerhurst, Cerney Wick, 
    Cirencester, GL7 5QH<br>
    The Committee agreed that the material to be used in construction and the 
    building design was not suitable due to its positioning in front of the 
    building line.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish 
    Council approves the recommendation of the Planning Committee. Cllr Mrs 
    Chubb abstained and the remainder of the Parish Council was in favour.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.3704/J</b><br>
    Applicant: Ms J. Dixon, Rose Cottage, Station Road, South Cerney,

    Outline erection of single dwelling with vehicle access for Good Intent, 
    Cerney Wick, Cirencester, Glos. (R)<br>
    Development here would be extending the ‘built envelope’ of the village into 
    open land. Moreover, the design and appearance of the proposed dwelling 
    should be shown in detailed plans before approval can reasonably be given.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish 
    Council ratifies the decision of the Planning Committee. The Parish Council 
    was all in favour.<br>
    OBJECTION<br>
    <br>
    <b>CT.4031/G</b><br>
    Mr &amp; Mrs K. Isles, Atkyns Lodge, Atkyns Manor, Silver Street, South Cerney, 
    Cirencester, Glos.<br>
    Replace flat roof over existing ancillary outbuilding with pitched roof 
    covered in reconstructed stone slates/tiles at Atkyns Lodge, Silver Street, 
    South Cerney, Glos.<br>
    Due to its conspicuous position and because it is within the curtilage of a 
    listed building the proposed use of reconstructed stone slates/tiles would 
    adversely affect the character of this part of the village.<br>
    It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Harris that the Parish 
    Council approves the recommendation of the Planning Committee. The Parish 
    Council was all in favour.<br>

    must also show details of all planting areas, species and proposed means of 
    enclosure and screening, including mounding, walls and fences, with details 
    of the materials of which they will be built and details of all the paving 
    and other hard surface materials to be used throughout the proposed 
    development. Reason: The proposed development and its location is such that 
    in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policy 41, landscaping is 
    necessary to enable it to fit in with its surroundings, enhance the locality 
    and to enhance the quality of the development itself for those using it. The 
    Council places a high priority on good quality landscaping.<br>
    12. Any trees or plants shown on the approved landscaping scheme to be 
    planted or retained which die, are removed, are damaged or become diseased, 
    or grassed areas which become eroded or damaged, within 5 years of the 
    completion of the approved landscaping scheme, shall be replaced by the end 
    of the next planting season. Replacement trees and plants shall be of the 
    same size and species as those lose, unless the Local Planning Authority 
    approved alternatives in writing. Reason: To ensure that the planting 
    becomes established and thereby achieves the objection of Cotswold District 
    Local Plan Policy 41.<br>
    13. Before any site preparation work or development starts each tree to be 
    retained or that is protected by a Tree Preservation Order, shall be 
    securely fenced to protect the area within the crown spread of a radius 
    equal to half of the height of the tree, whichever is the greater to accord 
    with BSI 58371991, Trees in Relation to Construction. Within the area or 
    areas fenced off no fires shall be lit and the existing ground level shall 
    remain the same and no building materials, temporary buildings or surplus 
    soil shall be placed, tipped or stored on it. If any trenches for services 
    are required in the fenced off area, they shall be excavated and back-filled 
    by hand and any tree roots encountered which have a diameter of 2cms or 
    more, shall not be severed. Reason: to ensure that the trees are protected 
    during construction work, in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan 
    Policy 25.<br>
    16. No floodlighting or external lighting of any kind shall be installed at 
    the site unless details have been submitted to and approved in writing by 
    the Local Planning Authority prior to their installation. Reason: To 
    safeguard the appearance of the area and/or the amenities of neighbouring 
    dwellings. This condition is imposed because of Cotswold District Local Plan 
    Policy 18 and PPG1.<br>
    17. No power craft other than emergency boats and those powered by LPG or 
    electric motors shall be used on the lake. Reason: To protect the amenity of 
    the locality, especially for people living and/or working nearby, in 
    accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 2, 18 and Water Park 
    Policy 8.1, and PPG24.<br>
    18. No lodge hereby approved shall be occupied prior to the permanent 
    cessation of the existing jet-ski use of the site. Reason: To protect the 
    amenity of the locality, especially for people living and/or working nearby, 
    in accordance with Cotswold District Local Plan Policies 2, 18 and Water 
    Park Policy 8.1, and PPG24.<br>
    19. The development shall not commence until a scheme for treating fumes and 
    odours, so as to render them innocuous before their emission to the 
    atmosphere, has been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and 
    the means of treating the fumes and odours shall be permanently installed 
    and operational before the development is brought into use or occupied. 
    Reason: To ensure that any concentration of air pollutants in the vicinity 
    is minimised and/or a nuisance is not caused in accordance with Cotswold 
    District Local Plan Policies 2, 18 and Water Park Policy 8.1 and PPG23.<br>
    25. Notwithstanding Classes C2 and C3 of the Schedule of the Town and 
    Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, the accommodation shall be used 
    to provide holiday accommodation only, which shall not be occupied as 
    permanent, unrestricted accommodation or as a primary place of residence. 
    Reason: The site is not suitable for permanent, unrestricted accommodation 
    or as a primary place of residence because of its open countryside location. 
    This condition is imposed in the light of PPG21 and Policy 37 of the 
    Cotswold District Local Plan.<br>
    26. The holiday units to be erected as part of the development will not be 
    occupied from the 6th January until 5th February inclusive in each year. 
    Reason: To control the occupancy of the holiday units in an area where 
    unrestricted residential accommodation would not normally be permitted.<br>
    27. If at any time hereafter any holiday unit is let out by the developer, 
    or sub-let by a leaseholder, the lease or sub-lease shall contain a covenant 
    on the part of the leaseholder to comply with conditions 25 and 26, the 
    wording of such a covenant to have been previously submitted to and approved 
    in writing by the Council’s solicitor, such approval not to be unreasonably 
    withheld. Reason: To ensure the restriction on the occupancy of the unit is 
    strictly controlled in an area where unrestricted accommodation would not 
    normally be permitted.<br>

    and Hills to request that they cut them back.<br>

    without cross bars had been under discussion for over 12 months. It was
