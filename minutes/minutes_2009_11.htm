    <p align="left">Chairman Cllr Stuart welcomed Peter Watson of Digital UK who 
    gave a presentation on the forthcoming switchover from analogue to digital 
    television reception. Some of the village would switch to digital reception 
    from the Mendip transmitter on 24th March 2010 and the remainder from the 
    Ridge Hill transmitter in 2011 although a final date had not yet been set. 
    Those in the first group would have their analogue signal completely 
    switched off on 7th April. The digital signal will be boosted by at least a 
    factor of 10 then. Signal reception can be investigated on page 284 of 
    Teletext. Further information can be found on the internet
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/">www.digitaluk.co.uk</a> 
    or on 08456 50 50 50. On 6th January there will be a mobile information van, 
    painted pink, operating from the Tesco car park at Greenmeadow, Cirencester. 
    Mr Watson emphasised that only accredited representatives of Digital UK 
    should be invited into your home for advice. There will be further 
    information sent to every household in the area before the switchover. Cllr 
    Stuart thanked Mr Watson for his presentation.</p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">The Chairman , Cllr Stuart opened proceedings at 7.46pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>APOLOGY</b> <br>
 Cllr Kimberley had sent an apology for his absence as he was engaged on a 
 family matter. Cllr Bennett (CDC) had sent an apology as he was attending 
 another meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON
 14th OCTOBER 2009</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr P. Jay and seconded by Cllr J. 
 Caunce that the minutes were a true and accurate record. Members of the Parish 
 Council were all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL REPORT</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Joe Lodge gave a report on recent activities of the Youth 
 Parish Council. Of the current six members, three would be going to University 
 in July, one was stepping down which left two. This core group would continue 
 to function and concentrate on recruiting new members to the YPC through the 
 Cerney News and local paper. Its next meeting was provisionally scheduled for 
 Tuesday 1st December and Joe invited as many Parish Councillors as possible to 
 attend. He promised to email the date and venue of the meeting to Parish 
 Councillors. Cllr Jay remarked that it was obvious to him that people will move 
 on and will need to be replaced. Cllr Jay showed Joe the artwork which he had 
 provided and explained that it would not reproduce properly on the duplicating 
 equipment used for Cerney News. Joe will reconstruct the artwork and email Cllr 
 Jay a revised version. Cllr Mrs Land arranged a meeting with Joe for Wednesday 
 18th November at 6pm at her house. Cllr Stuart thanked Joe for attending the 
 meeting and confirmed that he would sign his Duke of Edinburgh document.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>MATTERS ARISING</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart reported that he had sent an email to Paul 
 Swift, Gloucestershire Highways about the graffiti on the Bow Wow to no 
 immediate effect. Cllr Stuart and Cllr Jay went to a meeting of the Police 
 Neighbourhood Panel meeting at Siddington and raised this matter with the 
 police who said that they had in fact already inspected the area but did not 
 treat the damage as significant and took no action. The Clerk was asked to 
 write to Gloucestershire Highways and request them to remove the offending 
 writing on the carriageway and inform Les Haines, CDC Community Safety Officer 
 that the Parish Council was disappointed with the lack of reaction from the 
 Gloucestershire Constabulary to the incident. Cllr Harris reported that he had 
 detected further graffiti applied to play equipment on the Robert Franklin Way 
 play area and will report it to the police.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 15th October I attended meetings of the 
 Charter Group and the AGM of the GAPTC held in the Cabinet Room at Shire Hall, 
 Gloucester. Hester Hunt chaired the meeting. Amendments to the Charter had been 
 published in the GAPTC Update magazine and these should be inserted into the 
 original document. Mark Parker, Head of Flood, PROW and Travellers spoke at 
 length on the progress the County Council had made since the July 2007 floods. 
 On the prickly problem of riparian rights the focus now was on surface water 
 management by agreement with landowners. Enforcement was not a priority. After 
 the floods a levy was imposed which raised and extra £2.3m from Council Tax. 
 Most of this had been used, but not all, on capital projects. Partnerships had 
 been formed with other agencies and amounts of funding had generated many times 
 its initial worth. Now that the money was nearing exhaustion the budget was 
 reducing exponentially. In 2008 the budget was £8m, in 2009 it was £4m and in 
 2010 would be £2m. Properties flooded throughout the county in the disaster 
 amounted to 4,500. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Mike Reid, Construction Admin Manager of Road Management 
 Services, the company responsible for maintaining the A419 and A417, described 
 his work. There was some criticism about the débâcle last year of a snow 
 clearing exercise which failed. Mike blamed the weather forecasters who had got 
 it wrong. Part of the difficulty is timing the salt run. Snow usually starts 
 off as slushy rain and if salt is applied it will be washed away. There is a 
 critical moment just before it freezes when the application is most efficient 
 and determining when, is problematic. Most decisions are taken around 2pm for 
 the coming night’s work but weather is unpredictable. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">I enquired when the concrete surface from Latton through 
 to the other side of Cirencester might be resurfaced with tarmacadam. 
 Originally it was thought that it would last for 10 years but was proving much 
 more durable and was likely to last for more than 30 years. The original 
 contract in 1996 to manage the road had been for 30 years. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Charter meetings are now on a quarterly basis and the next 
 one is scheduled for 14th January 2010.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>SLCC Annual Conference Report</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 23th, Saturday 24th and Sunday 25th October I 
 attended the annual conference of the SLCC at Daventry. The keynote speech was 
 given by Gerry Stoker, Professor of Politics and Governance at the University 
 of Southampton. He had strong views on political disenchantment and civic 
 behaviour. Thereafter I attended various workshops: finance in challenging 
 times which focused on interest rates, where and how to safely invest public 
 money and the problem with new electronic banking and its authorisation; a 
 planning case study; help available for clerks of smaller councils; employment 
 support session with Bethan Osborne the national HR advisor to the society; a 
 lecture on local government and its horizons by three local MPs, two of whom 
 would not be standing at the next election and another who would join the Upper 
 Chamber shortly. Two workshops on personal skills – one on mental toughness on 
 how to handle stress and another on negotiating skills. I found both of these 
 stimulating. In fact I volunteered as a Guinea pig and was hypnotised to 
 demonstrate the effect of how stress can be an unseen, unfelt part of our 
 makeup of which we are not aware. The highlight for me was the motivational 
 speaker Miles Hilton-Barber an internationally renowned blind adventurer. If 
 sighted pilots had to learn to fly blind, i.e. on instruments, then why 
 couldn’t blind people become pilots. He fascinated us with stories of his 
 exploits from flying a microlight from UK to Australia, to taking part seven 
 times in the world’s toughest marathons across the Sahara desert, walking to 
 the South Pole, to deep sea diving. Fear he said was only a word for false 
 evidence appearing real. All achievers are dreamers but not all dreamers are 
 achievers. How to handle bullying in the workplace was a recurrent topic and 
 Glenys Stacey, Chief Executive of Standards for England discussed a range of 
 incidents. As always I enjoyed the conference although this year there was not 
 the plethora of new legislation to contend with, probably due to the 
 forthcoming election. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On 2nd November I attended a meeting at CDC where Lynden 
 Stowe, Leader at CDC outlined the problems faced by the District Council in 
 providing services with a dwindling income. The gathering was divided into a 
 number of working groups to thrash out which discretionary services parish and 
 town councils would wish CDC to continue to provide. Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb also attended although Cllr Nicholas and myself had to leave before the 
 end as we both had prior appointments.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb added that his impression of the outcome of the 
 workshop was that local government would function just as well if it was under 
 the control of a Unitary Authority. This was evidenced by the collection of 
 waste which is a CDC responsibility but its disposal was that of the 
 Gloucestershire County Council. Surely, he argued, could not the whole 
 operation be controlled by a single authority?</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During October of the 22 available working days I averaged 
 3 hours 30 minutes per day which is about par for my contract. I did not 
 include attending the conference in the calculations which, if I did, would 
 have boosted my hours excessively.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE VILLAGE MAINTENANCE &amp; 
 PLAYING FIELDS COMMITTEE HELD ON MONDAY 9th NOVEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce, Cllr Mrs Chubb, Cllr Harris, Cllr Kimberley, 
 Cllr Nicholas, Cllr Stuart and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge attended the meeting. Cllr 
 Caunce had opened the meeting at 7pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matters Arising from previous Minutes</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">As Cllr Stuart had another meeting to attend at 7.30pm 
 Cllr Caunce promoted those items of Matters Arising which especially concerned 
 Cllr Stuart. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wildmoorway Lane. </b>Cllr Stuart reported that work is 
 well advanced on the clearance of the overgrown hedges and silted ditches along 
 most of the lane. Cllr Stuart accompanied Mike Barton and Phil Cluley from GCC 
 PROW to inspect the progress and all were delighted with the job. Cllr Stuart 
 was pleased with the way in which much of the pathway is not too wet although 
 the far end is quite muddy. The people carrying out the work stated that the 
 clearance of the silted ditch should result in the pathway drying out all along 
 the length. Landowner Mr Dave Read had installed an electric fence to keep his 
 cattle away from the workings but it was unknown if this would be a permanent 
 feature. GCC PROW is very keen to put in a pathway using some form of aggregate 
 but the Environment Agency will have to be consulted which might result in a 
 delay. Mike Barton would like to apply for further funds to build up the path 
 in the next financial year although there is an outside chance that finance 
 from another source may be available sooner. Cllr Stuart believes that if the 
 Parish Council was minded to contribute this would be seen as a positive sign. 
 Previously the Parish Council successfully contributed some £3,000 to the 
 Shorncote Link and a similar sum pledged to this scheme would be seen as a 
 convincing move to potential grant funders. The Parish Council had previously 
 indicated its willingness to make a contribution and the scheme is one of the 
 Village Plan objectives. It was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr 
 Caunce that the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee asks the 
 Finance Committee to agree to its plan and recommend that the Parish Council is 
 minded to contribute a sum to encourage the scheme. The Committee was all in 
 agreement. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up car park</b>. Cllr Stuart reported that he had 
 spoken with representatives of both the Football and Cricket clubs on the 
 redesign of car parking facilities at Upper Up. He also discussed the 
 proposition with Roger Sollis (CDCWaste Management) who confirmed that he had 
 no objection. A replacement bin for cardboard collection will be installed 
 shortly which will be more user friendly. The bin will be emptied on site every 
 7 days which will lessen the wear of the car park surface. Cllr Stuart will 
 have further meetings with potential contractors and hopes to be able to give 
 an estimate of costs at the December council meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hedge at Kewstoke.</b> Cllr Stuart had met with Mrs S. 
 Dickson who assured him that the hedge will be cut back to allow the public 
 light to show off the pathway. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Grass cuttings.</b> Cllr Stuart persuaded Mr D. 
 Higginson to deliver the grass cuttings from the cricket field to the 
 composting bins. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>BT Red Telephone Boxes</b>. Newspaper reporter Andy 
 Woolfoot informed Cllr Stuart that BT reportedly does not remove the kiosks if 
 they are unadopted. Consequently Cllr Stuart had enquired from BT as to the 
 validity of this action and a reply is awaited. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Scout HQ/Youth Facility.</b> Following a meeting with 
 local scout commissioners Ian Kennedy has not had a reply to his enquiry from 
 scout headquarters. Mr Kennedy will now press the County Commissioner on the 
 issue. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bus Shelters in Station Road.</b> The Clerk will 
 enquire from Garrick Outdoor on the delay in replacing the damaged panel of the 
 new bus shelter. A further request will be made to Jonathan Roberts (GCC 
 Transport) that timetables are installed at both bus shelters in South Cerney. 
 The light fitting replaced by Southern Electric in the shelter by the Limes had 
 stopped working and the company will be informed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overgrowing hedge in Bow Wow.</b> The Clerk had asked 
 Paul Swift (Gloucestershire Highways) if he would liaise with Lady Fanshawe on 
 the condition of the hedge overgrowing in Bow Wow. Mr Swift will cut back the 
 growth on the opposite side and then request Lady Fanshawe if she will arrange 
 for the growth on the other side of the lane to be similarly reduced. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Les Haines.</b> Les Haines, Community Safety Officer at 
 CDC will be retiring shortly. The Clerk was asked to write to thank him for the 
 advice and support he has provided throughout his time at CDC.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Barracks Footpath. </b>Cllr Caunce had met with Paul 
 Swift to discuss warning signs to alert road users of the new access of the 
 footpath. Mr Swift noted the potential and will discuss the provision of 
 suitable signage with his colleagues. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Car Parking in Berkeley Close.</b> Cllr Caunce reported 
 that he had met with Mrs Lancaster and discussed the parking problem in 
 Berkeley Close. However, he explained that it was not for the Parish Council to 
 become involved in parking disputes. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Damage to Cherry tree</b>. The Clerk reported that no 
 compensation had been received. Cllr Harris will make a further effort to 
 persuade the person responsible to make the promised payment. Cllr Harris 
 reported at the Parish Council meeting on Wednesday that the person had 
 returned to University and did not have funds available at the moment. He will 
 exert further pressure and make a further report on his progress at next 
 month’s meeting. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Allotments</b>. Cllr Nicholas reported that the 
 Gloucester Diocese Committee had turned down a request to provide additional 
 allotments in South Cerney. Cllr Stuart had written to The Archbishop of 
 Canterbury at Lambeth Palace asking him to intercede on behalf of applicants. 
 The Archbishop’s Correspondence Secretary Mr Nunn had replied that the 
 Archbishop had no standing in the deliberations of the Diocese Committee and is 
 not party to its decisions. Mr Nunn confirmed that a copy of the correspondence 
 had been forwarded to the Bishop of Gloucester for his information.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>INSPECTION REPORTS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb and Cllr Mrs Tunbridge had carried out the inspections. Both 
 Councillors reported that all was in order although the wheels were still off 
 the train. Cllr Harris confirmed that he was in possession of them and 
 arrangements would be made, possibly in the Spring, to reinstate them.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the play equipment was all in order. Cllr Caunce 
 volunteered to trim back the tree mid-way along the southern boundary to give 
 better visibility of the play area. Moss clearance of the safety surfaces had 
 been carried out satisfactorily.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that the Fenplay safety areas had new sand applied. The 
 work was satisfactory. There were some broken pallets on the cycle mounds which 
 needed to be removed. The electricity contractor had left piles of branches to 
 the north of the mounds. Cllr Harris volunteered to contact the contractor and 
 ask him to clear up. Alternatively the job could be accomplished when the 
 hedges are flailed later in the month. The area was generally tidy except for 
 the increase in mole activity between the cricket and tennis areas. The 
 footings underneath the youth shelter at Upper Up had not been repaired by Park 
 Leisure. Cllr Nicholas volunteered to remove the pallets.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CLEARANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF THAT AREA OF LAND BETWEEN 
 THE MILL STREAM AND BOW WOW</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce suggested that the Parish Council asks for 
 volunteer groups to become involved in the maintenance of a part of the bank as 
 a biodiversity project. Groups would be encouraged to compete and a winner 
 could be judged on the weekend of the Duck Race for a small prize. Cllr 
 Nicholas asked that Gloucestershire Highways is informed and agrees that the 
 Parish Council manages the bank in much the same way as it does the other grass 
 verges throughout the village. At the Parish Council meeting Cllr Stuart stated 
 that he was concerned about the health and safety aspect of people working on 
 the bank so close to the mill stream and the proximity of the carriageway, 
 especially if youngsters were involved. Cllr Jay said that professionals should 
 be used to do the initial clearance. Generally the Parish Council would welcome 
 the clearance of the area. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Harris and Cllr Jay volunteered to 
 walk the lane, decide on what needs to be done and draw up a specification 
 which the Clerk will forward to potential contractors. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REFURBISHMENT OF GUTTERING ON THE BUS SHELTER AT THE 
 LIMES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to enquire if the shelter was a Listed 
 Building or under any other planning restriction. Once determined a contractor 
 might be instructed to refurbish the guttering. Laurie Davis at CDC Planning 
 confirmed that the shelter was not listed and there was no planning 
 restrictions. She suggested that instead of plastic guttering the Parish 
 Council might consider using cast aluminium as an alternative to plastic. The 
 Parish Council agreed to an assessment by Cllr Stuart that replacing the 
 guttering was of no obvious benefit. Cllr Caunce, Cllr Harris and Cllr Jay 
 agreed to inspect the area to see if the broken gutters need to be disposed of. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>APPOINTMENT OF A PREFERRED CONTRACTOR </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee agreed that it considers the appointment of 
 a preferred contractor for a range of maintenance tasks. Such jobs could be 
 categorised as either urgent, that is work to be carried out within a week of 
 notice or non-urgent which would require action within three weeks. A contract 
 would be awarded for a term based on a fixed number of hours at a competitive 
 rate. The Clerk was asked to analyse ground maintenance work, excepting grass 
 cutting, over a period of three years and present a list to the committee at 
 its next meeting. Cllr Caunce was adamant that the term preferred is removed 
 from the description. Nevertheless the Parish Council debated the options. Cllr 
 Stuart was concerned that if a contract was awarded then the opportunity for 
 dishonesty was prevalent. Cllr Nicholas supported the point that further 
 thought should be applied before a commitment was made. The Clerk was asked to 
 include the subject as an agenda item for the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance agenda for next month. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that the Finance Committee is 
 minded to agree to support a contribution towards the cost of a pathway in 
 Wildmoorway Lane using some form of aggregate. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Committee recommends that Tim Bryant is paid as his 
 work has been considered satisfactory.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that a street furniture sign on 
 the entrance to Wickwater Lane, off the Spine Road, had been damaged. Cllr 
 Caunce encouraged her to report the incident to Gloucestershire Highways on 
 08000 514 514. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chubb reported that the glass in the new bus 
 shelter had not been replaced. She also noted that there wasn’t a timetable in 
 the shelter. The Clerk will ask Garrick Outdoor to replace the glass and inform 
 Jonathan Roberts at GCC Transport about the missing timetable. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris reported a pot hole in the vicinity of No.5 
 Robert Franklin Way. Cllr Caunce encouraged him to report the incident to 
 Gloucestershire Highways on 08000 514 514. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris presented a cheque for £140 from Mr &amp; Mrs 
 Veitch for the planting of a memorial tree.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce stated that work on gulley cleaning and flood 
 relief would begin in Cerney Wick during the last week of November. The road 
 could be closed during the period. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TASK LIST </b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris confirmed that work would start on cutting 
 back the hedgerow at Upper Up in two to four weeks time. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Clerk was to enquire from Gloucestershire Highways if 
 there was any update on the work in Bow Wow which was due to start sometime 
 later in 2009. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>CORRESPONDENCE</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Football Club had asked permission to erect additional 
 lighting at Upper Up in its efforts to improve the facilities and utilisation 
 of the Upper Up playing fields. The Clerk had written to Kay Allen and asked 
 her to enquire from CDC if planning permission was needed. Cllr Nicholas was in 
 favour if the facility was only used infrequently. He would like the Football 
 Club to confirm how often it intended to make use of the proposed facility. 
 Cllr Stuart had spoken to both Gordon Stratford Chairman of the South Cerney 
 Football Club and Kevin Messenger who informed him that the lights would most 
 probably be used for two evenings a week for two hour sessions. On that basis 
 the Parish Council had no objection. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Katie Spencer from Play Gloucestershire had asked 
 permission to provide a fire pit as part of the Play Ranger sessions at Upper 
 Up. Cllr Kimberley agreed in principle although he had reservations and would 
 like to see the Risk Assessment and Public Liability insurance of the Play 
 Rangers. The Clerk will contact Katie Spencer and let her know of his concerns 
 and ask her to liaise with him. The Committee agreed that if Cllr Kimberley 
 approved the arrangements then it would have no objection to the provision of a 
 fire pit. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Caunce had closed the 
 meeting at 8.35pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>REPORT ON THE MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE HELD ON
 MONDAY 9th NOVEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb attended the 
 meeting. Cllr Webb opened the meeting at 8.35pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Apology <br>
 </b>Cllr Jay had sent his apology as he was otherwise engaged.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Spread Sheet Analysis</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Webb noted that the expenditure detailed on the 
 spread sheet for period 7 was in order. Village maintenance expenditure was 
 below budget.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Recommendations for acceptance from the Playing Fields
 and Village Maintenance Committee</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee considers that it is minded to agree to 
 support a contribution towards the cost of a pathway in Wildmoorway Lane using 
 some form of aggregate. At the Parish Council meeting it was proposed by Cllr 
 Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Jay that the Parish Council is minded to make a 
 contribution of £4,000 to the scheme only on the understanding that this money 
 will unlock the rest of the funds needed to complete the work. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee 
 recommended that the Finance Committee agrees to pay Tim Bryant for the work 
 carried out on the safety surfaces at Upper Up and Cerney Wick and for the

 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Webb and seconded by Cllr Nicholas

 payments. The Committee agreed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The account for Exorno Ltd will be explained at the Parish

 <p class="MsoNormal">At the Parish Council meeting Cllr Stuart explained that 
 Exorno Ltd was importing two pieces of equipment from Sri Lanka on behalf of 
 Jinasena Ltd who had so generously donated the rotavator to our community and 
 was also supplying the shredder to the Composting Club at a very realistic 
 price. Cllr Nicholas was very hopeful that a grant from the Waste Management &amp; 
 Residual Waste Project at Gloucestershire County Council would defray all or 
 part of the invoiced cost. Cllr Jay warned that there could well be further 
 importation charges to follow. Cllr Nicholas stated that the chopper, when 
 operational, would provide an income for the benefit of the Parish Council. The 
 grant had been agreed to be made under the provision of the Village Plan. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Mrs Land 
 that the Parish Council agrees to make all of the above payments. The Parish 
 Council was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Correspondence
 </b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">The response from CDC to the query on the disposition of 
 Council Tax collected from Second Homes was still unclear. The Clerk was asked 
 to enquire how much revenue (both Council Tax and Business Rate) is raised in 
 the Parish from second homes and holiday homes and how is that revenue applied. 
 The Clerk was asked to arrange a meeting with Mr Rod Smith, Revenues and 
 Benefits Manager at CDC to include Cllr Jay, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr Webb. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">CDC requested notification of the precept amount not later 
 than 15th January 2010. The Finance Committee agreed it should meet on Tuesday 
 5th January at 7.30pm. Cllr Caunce, Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village 
 Maintenance Committee Cllr Caunce accepted and invitation to attend.</p>

 MONDAY 9th NOVEMBER 2009</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman, Cllr Mrs Land, Cllr Nicholas and Cllr 
 Webb attended the meeting. Cllr Nicholas opened the meeting at 9pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PLANNING APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BY COTSWOLD DISTRICT
 COUNCIL</b></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce and Cllr Harris both declared a prejudicial 
 interest in this application as the applicant was a business associate of 
 theirs and left the room. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>06/00540/FUL</b> <br>
 Applicant: Mr M. Thomas, c/o Watermark, Isis Lakes, Spine Road, South Cerney
 <br>
 Proposal: Construction of a motel with car park (revised scheme) on land at 
 Lake 7, Cotswold Water Park, South Cerney <br>
 The committee recommends that the previous objection is maintained. The amended 
 plans do not overcome the reasons for the previous objections made by South 
 Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council, namely: The proposed motel development 
 would fundamentally change the character of this rural location, as viewed from 
 the adjoining footpaths. The Parish Council is concerned as to the precise 
 appearance of the proposed buildings. The amended plans still show no details 
 describing the roof colour to be used. <br>
 Conditions requested if permission is granted as follows: <br>
 1. A wheel wash to be mandatory for all vehicles exiting the site during 
 construction. <br>
 2. A dedicated lane should be installed, to allow traffic accessing the motel 
 to turn right safely. <br>
 3. There is now sufficient reason with the level of new development along this 
 stretch of the B4696 (Spine Road) to reduce the speed limit to 40mph between 
 Station Road/Cerney Wick Lane junction north towards the A419 or to the line of 
 the old canal which is the Gloucestershire/Wiltshire border.<br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Stuart 
 that the Parish Council accepts the recommendation of the Planning Committee 
 and objects to this application. The Parish Council was all in favour. </p>

 two applications as he was a close neighbour of the applicant and remained 
 outside the room. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that work had started on the new 
 layby at Lake 10 as per the conditions imposed. The footpath was also under 
 construction. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Caunce reminded his colleagues that the restricted 
 occupancy condition of some holiday homes in the Parish would come into force 
 from 6th January until 5th February. Cllr Caunce asked Parish Councillors to be 
 vigilant and report any suspected breaches to Nigel Bowsher, Enforcement 
 Officer at CDC. Cllr Jenkins had raised this question at a CDC meeting but the 
 situation was complicated as various legal actions were either contemplated or 
 taking place on the validity of the condition restricting access. Cllr Nicholas 
 asked Cllr Jenkins to keep the Parish Council informed as it had an on-going 
 interest in the proceedings. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business Cllr Nicholas had closed 
 the meeting at 9.30pm. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ADOPTION OF RED TELEPHONE BOXES</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay who had proposed a motion, which Cllr Caunce had 
 seconded, that the Parish Council should decline the offer from BT to adopt the 
 red telephone boxes in South Cerney and Cerney Wick, agreed to withdraw the 
 motion. Then Cllr Caunce proposed and Cllr Jay seconded an amendment: as the 
 offer from BT would mean the removal of the telephone apparatus, the Parish 
 Council should refuse to adopt the boxes. The Parish Council was unanimously in 
 favour of this amendment.</p>

 that Section 106 money is not being used as agreed but seems to being spent on 
 keeping the company afloat. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay commented that on his recent travels in Cornwall

 initiatives for action notified to the constabulary were only effective for 
 three months as a priority it was pleasing to be informed that the police had 
 actually continued with such things as dealing with speeding traffic. Speed 
 checks had been carried out in the South Cerney area throughout the period but 
 only two people had been cautioned. The police officer reported that there had 
 been a marked improvement in the behaviour of individuals in the Robert 
 Franklin Way area. During the next period illegal parking in Clarks Hay, 
 throughout Station Road and the Lennards will be on the priority list for 
 action. Cllr Kimberley had forwarded his concern about parking outside the 
 Londis through the Clerk.</p>
