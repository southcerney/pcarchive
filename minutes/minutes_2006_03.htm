 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO Transport</b> <br>
 The Clerk was to ask Inspector Williams for a list of visits made to South 
 Cerney in January and February by PCSO Yeomans and the expected number when 
 transport is available.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chestnut Tree, Clarks Hay</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs A. Clark (CDC) reported that Matt Reid (CDC, Tree Officer) along with 
 Michael Grace (CDC Enforcement Planning Officer) had inspected the chestnut 
 tree in Clarks Hay. Both were satisfied that the recent work carried out in its 
 vicinity had not damaged the tree.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sewage</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart summarised various items of correspondence regarding offensive 
 odours and sewage problems in the village. Of particular note was the 
 installation of new soft start pumps which would hopefully reduce the pressure 
 on the rising main. Cllr Nicholas would represent the Parish Council at the 
 next meeting of the Flood Forum scheduled for 17th March.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">CLERK’S REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 10th February Cllr Squire and I completed the 
 grant application to the 2nd Homes Council Tax Fund.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Tuesday 22nd February I attended a meeting in the 
 Village Hall to discuss the formation of the Youth Council. Present were: 
 Claire Dowan, Les Haines (both CDC), Cllr Webb, Rachael King, Sinead Peare, Dan 
 Mills, Thomas Nicholas, Rebecca Lodge, Joe Lodge, Daniella Genillard, Seb 
 Genillard and Sandy Stewart. Claire Dowan opened the meeting at 6.30pm 
 outlining the plan and objective of forming a Youth Parish Council. On 
 formation of a YPC, a grant of £400 would be available from the CDC. Cllr Webb 
 was hopeful that the Parish Council might also make a contribution. Depending 
 on the number of volunteers it might be possible to hold an election but this 
 was not essential to the plan. It was envisaged that the numbers mirrored those 
 of the present Parish Council with members dividing into a Committee structure 
 although, once again, this was open to debate among members of the YPC. Les 
 Haines explained his role as Community Support Officer at CDC and I give a 
 short description of my duties as Clerk. Due to examination commitments neither 
 Seb Genillard nor Sandy Stewart would be able to commit to being members of a 
 Youth Parish Council. The group divided into two workshops to tease out how 
 they thought the plan might progress. It was suggested that clearer and more 
 visible advertisement of the scheme be made especially through the Cerney News. 
 Maybe something could be broadcast on the Parish Council’s web site. There 
 should be a period of preparation before formation. A Tuesday was the day 
 preferred for meetings. Other groups in the village should be involved in fund 
 raising. A request that the YPC should have its own film projector would be 
 discussed after formation. It was agreed that members of the YPC would be drawn 
 from the 11-18 age range. Joe Lodge consented to being the contact person for 
 those wishing to participate. When asked why a YPC was a good idea the group 
 responded that it will give them the chance to change the world around them. It 
 will enable the youth to get their opinion heard and are obviously the best to 
 ask what the youth really want. A final meeting to create a YPC was agreed for 
 Tuesday 28th March at 6.30pm. The meeting closed at 8pm.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Friday 24th February I attended a meeting in the 
 Village Hall organised by Chris Orphanides to discuss the offensive sewage 
 odour with Jenny Elliott and Peter Hankins both from Thames Water and Hilary 
 Beach CDC Environmental Health Officer. Also in attendance were Cllr Squire and 
 five other residents namely: Terry Brown, Peter Merson, David Spencer, Lesley 
 McCabe and Rob Andrews. Thames Water representatives were left in no doubt that 
 a problem did exist and it confirmed that odour monitors had been placed in the 
 system. First results will be known in early April and more when the high 
 occupancy of Watermark expires in late summer when comparisons can be made. 
 Peter Hankins informed the meeting that as Watermark had increased its dosage 
 of its system and no complaints were registered it was thought that the problem 
 had been eliminated. The discussion lasted about 1 hour 45 minutes and then 
 adjourned to inspect the system in the Kingfisher Place area. I have forwarded 
 a more detailed account of the meeting composed by Chris Orphanides to all 
 Parish Councillors.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday 2nd March I met with Cllr Nicholas and Sinead 
 Barker from GRCC and discussed how the Parish Council might interact to the 
 provision of affordable housing in the parish. Miss Barker would like to brief 
 Parish Councillors on the scheme prior to their meeting in May. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Inspector Williams had informed me that due to the 
 numerous invitations he had received on taking up his new post he was unable to 
 meet with Parish Councillors until the Annual Parish meeting in May. I will 
 formally invite him and the new Rural Beat Officer PC Palfrey to that meeting 
 on 17th May.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">During February over the 20 available working days I 
 averaged 3 hours 15 minutes per day which is par for my contract.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">PLAYING FIELDS AND VILLAGE
 MAINTENANCE COMMITTEE REPORT</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire reported on the deliberations of the Playing 
 Fields and Village Maintenance Committee which had met on 6th March.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>PCSO Transport </b><br>
 Cllr Caunce reported out of interest that in the course of business a Wiltshire 
 PCSO had informed him that officers in that constabulary were encouraged to use 
 public transport whilst carrying out their duties. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick Lane</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce and Cllr Mrs Chapman both complained about the dirty state of 
 Cerney Wick Lane. Since the last meeting Lake 10 has been closed. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way Slide</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart was still endeavouring to make arrangements with Steve Hanson of 
 the Community Pay Back group. Cllr Stuart explained that currently Mr Hanson is 
 on holiday. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The Piece &amp; Village Hall Deeds</b> <br>
 Cllr Mrs Chubb could find no record in her files on the transfer of the Piece 
 to the Parish Council but was willing, if needed, to confirm that fact in 
 writing. The Clerk thanked Cllr Mrs Chubb for her efforts. Ms V. Hancock, Davey 
 Franklin Jones (Solicitors), is to be informed of Cllr Stuart’s recollection 
 that, a few years ago, her firm was in possession of the deeds to the village 
 hall. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Litter at Old George <br>
 </b>The Clerk was asked to remind the occupiers of the Old George that litter 
 was still being thrown over the wall on to the river bank. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Honey Combed Safety Surface</b> <br>
 The Committee agreed to a suggestion from Cllr Squire that the Clerk write 
 directly to the suppliers of the safety surface, Technix Rubber Ltd, explain 
 the problem being experienced and ask if there was a remedy. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>2nd Homes Grant Application</b> <br>
 Cllr Squire confirmed that an application had been made to the fund.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">INSPECTION REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Upper Up play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Stuart reported that due to the very cold weather the cycle mounds had 
 hardly been used. The Community Pay Back team had almost completed its work on 
 the hedge between the lake and the cricket field. The rest of the play 
 equipment was in good order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Robert Franklin Way play area <br>
 </b>Cllr Harris reported that the equipment at Robert Franklin Way was in good 
 working order. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cerney Wick play area</b> <br>
 Cllr Caunce reported that the equipment at Cerney Wick was in good working 
 order although the sand on the new safety surface was still in evidence. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>TREE MAINTENANCE QUOTATIONS</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Harris declared a prejudicial interest in this item 
 and left the room, as he had quoted for the work involved.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Three quotations had been received and the Clerk was asked 
 to relate the prices quoted but not to make reference at this time as to who 
 had made the quotation. As James Harris Contracting was the most competitive 
 received it was proposed by Cllr Stuart and seconded by Cllr Squire that the 
 Committee recommends to the Finance Committee the contract be awarded to James 
 Harris Contracting. The Committee was all in favour.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
 <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">COUNCILLORS’ REPORTS</span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Squire gave a report on a meeting with 
 representatives from Thames Water, CDC and residents who had met on Tuesday 
 22nd February in the Village Hall to discuss offensive sewage odours in the 
 village. Thames Water had installed monitoring devices in the system the 
 results of which would be given to members of the public in April. It was 
 planned to leave the devices in situ and compare the data again in late summer 
 thereby giving a better picture of how the system performs during periods of 
 light and heavy use. The group then visited Kingfisher Place, Station Road and 
 Robert Franklin Way to inspect the drains. No immediate problems were 
 encountered but it was agreed that if and when the odour is noticed a Thames 
 Water engineer from Cricklade would be summoned.</p>

     the vicinity outlining the new arrangements. <br>
     The delay in sourcing power for the interactive speed limits surprised 
     members of the Committee who had attended a meeting with Mr Whittaker and

 1QT <br>
 Display of two non-illuminated fascia signs and three non-illuminated wall 
 mounted signs at the Eliot Arms, Clarks Hay, South Cerney <br>
 The Parish Council objects to the above application because it considers that 
 if permission is granted then there will be too many advertisement signs on and 
 in the vicinity of the building. It will be very detrimental to the visual 
 amenity of this picturesque focal point of the village. All signage in this 
 Conservation Area of the village must be strictly controlled especially that 
 which is faux-traditional and garish. Other signs, not included in this 
 application, are already in place and either must be applied for or removed. 
 These include the banner advertisement, the “Room at the Inn” sign and other 
 lighting. It is recommended that the Enforcement Officer acquaints himself with 
 the brightness of the illumination before a decision is taken on whether this 
 is acceptable. <br>
 OBJECTION </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">It was proposed by Cllr Jay and seconded by Cllr Caunce 
 that the Parish Council accepts the deliberations of the Planning Committee.

 Cllr Nicholas reported on a meeting he attended with Sinead Barker (GRCC) in 
 which she outlined her task to facilitate the provision of affordable housing. 
 Her first objective would be to determine need in the community and would 
 welcome the support of the Parish Council to make such an assessment. Cllr 
 Nicholas considered that the Parish Council would gain valuable insight into 
 the level of need for such housing provision in the parish and therefore be 
 better informed to comment on this subject in relation to residential planning 
 applications. Ms Barker would welcome an opportunity to meet with Parish 
 Councillors to discuss her plans in more depth. The assembled Parish 
 Councillors agreed that Ms Barker is invited to make a presentation to them 
 prior to the May meeting.</p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><b>VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Stuart began the discussion on how to make progress 
 with the village plan. Partnership with local groups would be encouraged and 
 Parish Councillors volunteered to support the 14 point action plan. Cllr Mrs 
 Pollard would produce bulletin boards to track progress and these will be 
 displayed in the Committee Room. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay was concerned with the erosion being caused to 
 both sides of Bow Wow lane. Spring bulbs on the northern side of the lane were 
 noticeably closer to the water course than in the past. On the Mill Race side 
 larger vehicles had widened the carriageway by gouging out the bank. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Jay enquired from Cllr Bennett (CDC) and Cllr Mrs 
 Clark (CDC) how bus passes would operate in the District in the light of the 
 Chancellor of the Exchequer’s recent pronouncement that they would only be 
 valid in the Districts which issued them. </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">Cllr Mrs Chapman reported that the carriageway at the 
 Barn/Manor Farm House corner in Cerney Wick flooded during periods of heavy 
 rain. The Clerk was asked to inform the Clerk at Latton about the accumulation
