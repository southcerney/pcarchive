    <h2>South Cerney Female Provident and Friendly Society</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">This is the earliest village society of which there are records.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was established in 1839 and was registered in
    1897, with the Vicar, the Rev W E Haddow as Trustee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A copy of the rules survives, belonging to the late Miss Kate Willis.</p>
    <h2>South Cerney Amicable Society</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">This was founded in 1849, and held its annual meeting at the George
    Inn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1852, upwards of 100 members attended
    the meeting and proceeded to the parish church, headed by a band of musicians.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the service &#145;the member then returned
    to the George Inn and dined in a spacious booth erected for the occasion; but we are sorry
    to add that several members were very dissatisfied with the accommodation, being obliged
    to dine with their hats on, and to make use of their pocket handkerchiefs to keep out the
    rain, which was penetrating through the booth in all directions.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the cloth was removed the usual loyal toasts
    were proposed and duly responded to.&#146;</p>

    <h2>Foss Inn Benefit Society</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1852 the annual meeting was held.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A procession of fifty people went to the church and attended a service.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They returned to an &#145;excellent dinner of
    roast beef and plum pudding prepared by the host, Mr and Mrs Pollard, which was very
    enjoyable&#146;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was held on 5<sup>th</sup>
    June, 1852.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(W &amp; G, June 1852)</em></p>
    <h2>The Women&#146;s Institute</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Women&#146;s Institute was started in South Cerney in 1917, with
    Mrs Cripps as President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Forty years later,
    thirteen of the original members still lived in or near the village.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A hundred people were present at the first
    meeting.</p>
    <h2>Clubs</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">There were at least five clubs in Cerney parish:<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#145;The Miller&#146;s&#146;, &#145;The
    Oak&#146;, &#145;The George&#146;. &#145;The Eliot Arms&#146;, and &#145;Horse and Groom,
    and &#145;The Plough&#146;.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Club days were held at Whitsun and each club has its own banner.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The day started with a march to the church, the
    leaders carrying big sticks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the church
    service, a return march with the Vicar leading ended at the public house and a dinner.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dancing followed outside the inns in a paddock
    with a band, side-shows, and horse-driven roundabouts, often hired from Ambrose Smith of
    Ashton Keynes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When dusk came everyone played
    &#145;Kiss-in-the-ring&#146; and began to pair off.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Long afterwards Mr R Stait found one of the big sticks, which was
    used when they marched, in a barn behind the Plough Cottage, Station Road.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was very worm-eaten.</p>
    <h2>The Girl Guides</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The South Cerney Guide Company was formed in 1921, and the first
    Captain was Mrs Smyth, with her two lieutenants, Mrs A C Stephens and Miss Whitcombe(Mrs
    Cooper), and sixteen girls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were two
    patrols: the Wrens with the older girls, and the Oak patrol with the younger members.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first uniforms were made by the Guides
    themselves, no doubt with the help of their parents.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">This Company has been going continuously for the last fifty years
    without a break.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The highlights during the first years were the Rally held in the
    Abbey Gardens, Cirencester, when South Cerney won the District Shield and came fourth in
    the County Shield Competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1933 the
    South Cerney Company was chosen to be the Company to be visited by representatives of the
    Indian Civil Service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1937 Miss Myrtle
    Street (Mrs Crowther) was chosen as one of the five Guides from Gloucestershire to attend
    the coronation of King George VI.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">During these fifty years the South Cerney Guides have entered many
    competitions and have done extremely well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
    have helped with innumerable activities in the village, and they have attended camps all
    over the County.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have raised money for
    Air Ambulances, Army Rest Huts, Recreation Huts and Mobile Canteens among other things,
    and they have never missed, even during the war, giving Christmas parcels each year to the
    older inhabitants of Cerney parish, and also parcels to the Cerney men serving during the
    last war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs Whiteman is the present Captain
    and has been for many years, and with a full company is continuing the Guide tradition and
    her Company have been doing extremely well.</p>
    <p><big><big><strong>COSY Club</strong></big></big></p>
    <p><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">This club was started in 1958
    by Mrs Waddington-Jones for the older people in South Cerney.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The initials mean &#145;Cerney Over Sixty
    Years&#146;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><big><big><strong>South Cerney Players</strong></big></big></p>
    <p><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">This dramatic society was
    started in 1936.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They began with one-act
    plays which were produced in aid of the Royal National Lifeboat Society.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In their first year they made £2.18.1d and they
    were also able to give £5.16.2d to the Village Hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Since then they have performed many plays which have been greatly enjoyed.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the last war this society lapsed, but it
    was revived in 1966 and since then it has put on four plays, which have been greatly
    enjoyed by the audience as well as by the actors and members of the company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <h2>The South Cerney Flower Show</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Flower Show was started in 1891 and has been held in various
    fields in the parish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1896 the Rev Hadow
    was president and the Cirencester Military Band was present.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a large horticultural tent and there
    were sports, of which a large number of races were cycling, the longest distance being two
    miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was dancing in the evening.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It is not known why the Show was not held from 1900 to 1904.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In 1907, in the horticultural section, there was an industrial
    section which included a prize for the best pair of trussed ducks, and the best ironed
    white shirt (which was won by Mrs C Wheeler), and home-made bread.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1908, as well as the horticultural section,
    there were flat races, a Gretna Green race, zig-zag race, sack race and a needle and
    thread race.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were also sleight-of-hand
    tricks by Mr Brockman, and the Oaksey United Brass Band for dancing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Entrance 2 &#150; 4 pm 1/- and 4 &#150; 7 pm 6d.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">1920:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The show was held

    usual other attractions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Rev A M Coode
    was president, and it was stated that &#145;the only pass-out check will be a stamp on the
    wrist&#146; (which is still used today).</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">1932:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr Luker, the
    honorary secretary for 24 years, resigned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
    this time the receipts for the previous show were £23 and the bank balance was £34.12s.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since he started in 1908 the prize money had
    increased by 75%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 35<sup>th</sup> show,
    was held in the Village Hall, as they could not get a fair, but there was dancing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the last show until it was re-introduced
    in the 1950&#146;s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The profits were put
    towards a playing field for South Cerney.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It was at first held on a Saturday, but then moved to August Bank
    Holiday, and was a great success, with a horiticultural tent, sports, athletics, and cycle
    races.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the last seven years of the
    Show half the profits have been given to organizations in South Cerney and half to a
    charity.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(W &amp; G)</em></p>
    <h2>The South Cerney Trust</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Trust was started in 1963 by Mr E C R Hadfield.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a civic amenities society, whose aims are
    to support all activities which increase the pleasure of living in South Cerney and to
    support the best modern standards of industrial and residential planning.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="right"><em>(Mrs Bert Harding)</em></p>
    <h2>Entertainments</h2>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Village entertainments were organized by Mrs Cripps with the
    co-operation of the school from 1908.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    programme usually consisted of songs, duets, mono- and duo-logues, and ended with an item
    by the children from the village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These items
    were written for the occasion, incorporating anything up to twenty children &#150;
    &#145;The Months of the Year&#146; and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
    entertainments were held at the school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    proceeds were for the rebuilding of the church spire, but this never came about.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the first World War prices rose so much
    that all the funds were needed for restoring the church.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At this time County Dancing was started in the village.<span
