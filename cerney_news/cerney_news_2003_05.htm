    <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000"><p>The South Cerney Annual Parish
    Meeting took place on 21 May 2003 at the Village Hall where the Parish Council, District
    Council and County Council gave reports on what had been achieved during the previous
    year. Other reports were given by the Church, the local Police, the Village Hall Committee
    and for the first time at such a meeting representatives from 29 Regiment RLC. The
    outgoing Parish Council Chairperson, Jenny Gardiner, was publically thanked for the
    excellent work she had done for this community and was presented with a bouquet of flowers
    by the new Chairman.</p>
    <p>Questions were asked to most of those giving reports and an especially lively debate
    took place between an objector to aircraft noise from the camp airfield and the rest of
    those assembled. This proved to be a most useful discussion as having a representative
    from the Army and a member of the Silver Stars Parachute Display team present meant that a
    number of misconceptions were cleared up and a line of liaison established which should
    minimise the risk of future ill feeling being generated.</p>
    <p>It was disappointing that only 7 members of the public attended this meeting but
    perhaps everyone out there must be satisfied with the way in which the village is being
    ran!<u><b></p>
    <p>UPPER UP LEISURE PARK</b></u></p>
    <p>Work is well advanced with the construction of the new leisure park at our main playing
    field at Upper Up. The virtually unused area at the far end of the field is being
    transformed. A lake has been dug, one that you will be able to walk around whenever you
    want, and the spoil from that has been piled up into hillocks designed for our young
    people to ride their mountain bikes up and down and over. It has taken over 4 years in
    planning and fund raising but now it is almost there. Go and have a look. It is yours so
    use it.</font></td>
