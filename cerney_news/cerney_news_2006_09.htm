    <font size="4"><b>DOG MESS</b></font><br>
    Some irresponsible dog owners exercising their animals on the Upper
Up playing fields are not collecting their pets’ excrement. It is totally
abhorrent when pets’ faeces are left on the football fields for
unsuspecting players to tread in. If this conduct persists then the Parish
Council will take measures to restrict access to the playing fields for
all pets. <b>You have been warned.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>RUBBISH COLLECTION</b></font><br>
    All residents are requested to only put out rubbish for removal the
night before it is due for collection. When rubbish is left out for days
animals are very likely to rip the plastic bags and scatter the contents
making an unsightly mess. Some residents of Wildmoorway Lane and
Edwards College have been noted for leaving their rubbish out too
early and all are asked to stop this behaviour.</p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>MUD ON THE SPINE ROAD</b></font><br>
    Mud on the Spine Road and other roads off is a problem which has
exercised the Parish Council for some time. The Cotswold District
Council’s Planning Enforcement Officer, Mr. Colin Davis wishes to be
informed when such instances occur. He can be contacted by either
emailing <b><a href="mailto:enforcement@cotswold.gov.uk">enforcement@cotswold.gov.uk</a></b> or telephoning 
    <b>Cirencester
623000.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>CRIME REPORTING</b></font><br>
    When any resident has been affected by or witnessed any sort of crime
it is important that the police are informed. Besides the emergency
numbers low level instances of crime or other antisocial behaviour
should be reported to <b>0845 090 1234.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>STREET LIGHTING</b></font><br>
    To report faults in street lighting please telephone Freephone <b>0800
252382 </b>at any time. Each street light has an identity number and must
be quoted when reporting any fault.</p>
