<p align="left"><b>MEMBERS OF THE YOUTH GROUP AND ITS VISIT TO CHEDWORTH</b> </p>


On Thursday 21st October Cllr Jay and Cllr Stuart accompanied by a good number of the South Cerney Youth Group attended a Cotswold Parish Network Forum at Chedworth village hall. These meetings run by Gloucestershire Rural Communities Council give an opportunity for all parish councils to discuss problems and situations and to share views. This meeting was primarily concerning how to provide best facilities for the younger members of communities and our team of young people gave a top class presentation which impressed the other adult delegates. It is so good to see our young people being so positively involved in such meetings.

<p align="left"><b>PRECEPT CONSIDERATIONS</b> </p>


It is still not too late to make an application to the Parish Council for a grant if you are a local group with a good reason for seeking financial support. The Precept Committee will meet during the first week in January 2011 when it will decide its spending recommendations for the next year, i.e. from April 2011 through until March 2012. These will be put to the Parish Council for it to discuss at its meeting to be held on 12th January. If you have any comments on what you feel should be included in future discussions, then please contact a Parish Councillor and put forward your ideas. The Parish Council cannot make grants to individuals.
