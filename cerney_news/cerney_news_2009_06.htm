    <b>COMPOSTING CLUB</b>
    <p align="left">

    The South Cerney Composting Club is up and running. We now have our garden 
    waste composting site by the Upper Up car park, behind the recycling 
    containers. Club members can deposit their garden vegetation at any time, in 
    return for the £10 annual membership fee. We need a balanced mixture of 
    suitable garden materials, such as grass cuttings and woody shrubs, to be 
    deposited at the receiving bay. Volunteer members will then mix this into 
    the composting bins and turn it at intervals. The resulting compost will be 
    bagged up and available to members, free of charge.
    <p align="left">

    To join the Composting Club, please email
    <a href="mailto:Philip.Nicholas1@googlemail.com">
    Philip.Nicholas1@googlemail.com</a> or post your contact details in the 
    Composting Club letter box opposite the Post Office. We will arrange to 
    collect your £10 membership fee and in the meantime you can start 
    contributing your garden waste to the Upper Up site.

    Please note that only garden vegetation is allowed at our site. Kitchen 
    waste is not permitted in a community composting scheme. Cooked kitchen 
    waste should be recycled using your CDC green kitchen caddy, and kitchen 
    peelings etc should be composted at home.

    <b>GAMES AND THINGS AT UPPER UP PLAYING FIELDS </b>
    <p align="left">

    The Play Rangers hold a session on the playing fields every Tuesday from 
    around 4pm. Youngsters of school age are welcome to participate. Come along 
    and sample what is on offer. No charge.<p align="left">

    <b>RECYCLING BINS AT UPPER UP</b>
    <p align="left">

    The Parish Council is becoming increasingly disturbed by inconsiderate 
    people who are dumping rubbish in the vicinity of the recycling bins. For 
    your interest there is NO facility for glass bottles or polystyrene 
    packaging. Don’t leave it at the site. If the behaviour persists the Parish 
    Council will have no option but to ask the Cotswold District Council to 
    remove the facility altogether. ABUSE it and LOSE it.</td>
