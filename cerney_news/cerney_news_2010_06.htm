    <p align="left"><b>"GET YOUR WAY"</b> </p>

    <p align="left">Mary Mychaleckyj from the Gloucestershire Youth and Community Service is organising an event to attract youngsters from between 10-17 to join in activities and perhaps the Youth Parish Council. The "fun day" will take place on Friday 30th July on the Upper Up playing fields and all are welcome. Please look out for posters In the village advertising the occasion.

    </p>

    <p align="left"><b>CCTV</b> </p>

    <p align="left">CCTV has been placed on the Upper Up playing fields at the request of the Parish council and the Police at a hotspot for anti social behaviour and/or crime. The relevant signage is also in place. The camera has privacy zones that can be set so no one property can be viewed and invade personal privacy.

    </p>
    <p align="left"><b>EXCESSIVE NOISE AND POLLUTION</b> </p>

    <p align="left">If any residents are experiencing disturbance through recycling activities in Broadway Lane could they please direct their complaints to Ray Brassington at Cotswold District Council. Email ray.brassington@cotswoldgov.uk or telephone: 01285 623422.

    </p>
    <p align="left"><b>DEVELOPMENT OF OLD CAMAS SITE</b> </p>

    <p align="left">The Parish Council is in favour of holding a public meeting if or when a planning application is submitted by Harrow Estates for the continuance of development on the old CAMAS site. In the mean time residents should think about what benefits could accrue to the community in the event that planning permission is granted. It must be stated categorically that permission may well be rejected.


    </p>


    <p align="left"><b>OVERGROWN HEDGES</b>

    <p align="left">It is that time of year again when the growth of shrubs and hedges flourish. Some residents allow such excess to interfere with users of public footpaths and every year we have to write to several residents to cut back their offending plants. To prevent this nuisance to all can those with hedges please cut them back. Thank you in anticipation.
