    <font size="4"><b>RECENT INTERRUPTIONS TO THE MAINS ELECTRICITY
SUPPLY<br>
    </b>Following the numerous interruptions to the
electricity supply over a ten day period, to properties
in the western end of the village and to Siddington,
we have been informed by SEB that they have
experienced terrible problems in locating the source
of the troubles. Hopefully they have now carried out
the repairs but it was surprising that their records
apparently show that only a very few people had
telephoned them to report the interruptions. It is
essential that as many as possible do ring<b> 0845 7 70
80 90</b> to report any future disruption to the electricity
supply. Only by our continually reporting the power
cuts will it become apparent to the Southern Electric
that the problem should be taken seriously</font>.
