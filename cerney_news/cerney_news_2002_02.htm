    The Parish Council would welcome members of the public to attend an open debate, on
    Thursday 28 February at 7.30pm in the United Church Hall in Clarks Hay, on whether or not
    the Parish Council should object at the forthcoming appeal to Westbury Homes' outline
    planning application to build approximately 150 new homes on the CAMAS site. The Parish
    Council will hold an Extraordinary Meeting on 1 March at 7.30pm in the Committee Room of
    the Village Hall to decide on its response.<br>

    Bernie Cox, Cotswold Area Team Leader from Gloucestershire Youth &amp; Community Service
    is planning to hold a Youth Action Day in South Cerney on Sunday 24 March. The venue as
    yet is undecided but Mr Cox will publicise the event locally when final arrangements are
    in place.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><big>Watermark Club Development</big></font><br>
    Cotswold District Council has granted permission to an application for outline planning
    for a new building to provide restaurant, gym and swimming pool at the Watermark Club
    development, Spring Lake (Lakes 14 &amp; 15), Station Road, South Cerney. One of the
    Conditions of the granted permission is that no development shall commence on site until
    details of a pedestrian/cycle link between the development and the existing footway in
    South Cerney have been submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority. A Section
    106 Agreement states that the new club house will not be brought into use until the
    existing club house is closed to the public and Lake 16 car park has been completed in
    accordance with the approval granted.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Flood Report</strong></big></font><br>
    As a result of a Flood Prevention meeting held on 18 January, the Environment Agency
    resolved four initial problems regarding river Churn strategy. Local landowners would be
    contacted regarding water storage up stream of Siddington and South Cerney which was
    predicted to be in place by 2004-05 but compulsory purchase orders would be needed and
    this could cause some delay. Thames Water had checked all the monitoring systems and
    reported that the two in South Cerney were being operated correctly under normal
    conditions. All six pumping stations appeared to be working correctly although the studies
    had been carried out in extremely dry conditions. Thames Water had undertaken to clean the
    whole system. Due to the absence of a representative, Fosseway Housing submitted a written
    report informing the meeting that all the work in the drainage system was now completed.
    Fosseway Housing required isolating valves but this has been delayed as a special licence
    is necessary which Thames Water would arrange. </td>
