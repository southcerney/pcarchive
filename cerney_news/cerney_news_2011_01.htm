<p align="left"><b>UPPER UP TREE PLANTING</b> </p>


What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of significance in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a park seat installed on the Upper Up recreation field? Over the past few years trees have been planted by the Parish Council on the Upper up playing field paid for by those who wish to have a lasting memorial for a loved one or maybe to celebrate a special occasion such as the birth of a child. The Parish Council is committed to maintain these trees so that they can grow and become a feature of the landscape. If you would like to have a tree planted please contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812. Due to the continuing demand we will soon be running out of space on the current site.

<p align="left"><b>TV SWITCHOVER (CENTRAL TV REGION)</b> </p>

In April 2011, the Central TV region will begin the switch to digital television. The analogue signal for part of Gloucestershire comes from the Ridge Hill transmitter group. This signal will be switched off and replaced with a new, stronger digital signal. Anyone who currently receives only BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel Four, and Five through their aerial will need to convert their television before 6th April 2011 otherwise they will begin to lose channels. When switchover completes on 20th April 2011 they will not be able to receive any TV channels at all if they have not converted.
