The Chairman, Vice Chairman, Parish Councillors and Clerk wish the residents of South Cerney and Cerney Wick a very happy Christmas and best wishes for the New Year.

<p align="left"><b>PRECEPT MEETING</b> </p>

On Wednesday evening 7th December Cllr Jay Chairman of the Parish Council's Finance Committee gave a presentation at the Village Hall to 23 members of the public on how the setting of the precept impacts upon Council Tax contributions. After explaining how the system works members of the Finance Committee were available for discussion on potential projects on a one-to-one arrangement. If any group in the community has a scheme worthy of support please let Maurice McKee Parish Clerk know before Christmas Eve. Either email:<a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk"> clerk@southcerney.org.uk </a>or write to him at 6 North Home Road, Cirencester. Glos. GL7 1DP..

<p align="left"><b>NEW DOG MESS BINS</b> </p>

Three new dog mess bins were installed recently. There is one near the end of School Lane, in the vicinity of the river flow monitoring cabinet, another at the far end of Riverside Walk, parallel with Riverway and one in Ham Lane, beyond the tarmac stretch. It was decided to keep the one in Clarks Hay because of its regular use. These bins were installed at the request of people in the village and the Parish Council encourages responsible pet owners to continue to make use of them.

<p align="left"><b>PLAYGROUND AND PLAYING FIELD OF THE YEAR COMPETITION RESULT</b> </p>

The Parish Council entered the Upper Up sports field amenities in the Glos Playing Field Association annual competition to find the best facility in the country. Some 14 entrants were judged and out of a possible 150 points the winner scored 127. South Cerney came joint fourth with a very creditable score of 124. Unfortunately, in the Playground competition we were severely penalised due to some idiot having broken a glass bottle on the play surface immediately prior to the judges' visit.
