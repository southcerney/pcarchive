<p align="left"><b>ROBERT FRANKLIN WAY PLAY AREA	</b> </p>

The Parish Council agreed to let Gloucestershire Highways use part of its playing field at Robert Franklin Way to erect a compound to house site facilities and to store building materials and plant for two four week periods while the two old railway bridges are repaired. The two periods are necessary to allow for bat roosting at the bridges but all the compound and buildings will be removed and the site renovated between the two events. Although there will be some loss of grass play area, there will still be a more than adequate space left for the youngsters to play football in. The Parish Council negotiated some refurbishment of the wooden fence and the larger play equipment as compensation for the use of the play area.
