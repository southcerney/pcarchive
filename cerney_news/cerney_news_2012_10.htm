<p align="left"><b>SPEEDING VEHICLES THROUGH THE VILLAGE</b> </p>

More and more complaints are being received from residents about vehicles allegedly speeding through the village with little respect for other road users or pedestrians going about their lawful pursuits. The Parish Council appeals to all those who are inclined to break the speed limit to desist and show respect to others who share the highway.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>PRECEPT MEETING</b> </p>

All residents are invited to attend a public meeting on <b>Wednesday 7th November at 7.30 pm</b> in the Village Hall. The meeting is to explain how the Parish Council makes its financial plans for the coming year starting April 2013. It will be shown how a grant from the Parish Council could help the aspirations of local groups which have the best interests of the Parish of South Cerney with Cerney Wick in mind. Parish Councillors will gauge the feelings of villagers if there should be a need to increase the amount collected in Council Tax which is currently £45.32 a year for a Band D dwelling. If a club or recognised grouping are intending to make a bid for a grant it is vitally important that a representative is present at the meeting. Be advised that failure to attend the meeting may exclude any bid for a grant.

<p align="left"><b>VILLAGE HALL THATCHING AND BOILER REPLACEMENT</b> </p>

The Parish Council unanimously gave a vote of thanks to Cllr Peter Jay, Gill and Roger Scott who together successfully applied for grants to subsidise the re-thatching of part of the village hall roof and a replacement boiler. Grants totalling £20,332 have been awarded for these projects.
