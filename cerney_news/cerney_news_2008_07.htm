    <font size="4"><b>Cerney's Communal Composting Campaign<br>
    </b>Your Parish Council is supporting an initiative being set up by a group of people in the village who wish to start a Communal Composting scheme. These volunteers have carried out considerable research and have visited other similar schemes being successfully run in other parishes. Various sites are being considered in our village but before going any further we need to have some idea as to what sort of support there will be from this village. The team have prepared a short explanatory leaflet regarding the project and that includes a questionnaire, both of which are being delivered to every dwelling in the Parish with this newsletter. Please do help us by answering the questionnaire and retuning it to our team. This is an excellent project that deserves your support. Please get involved.</font>

    <font size="4"><b>Upper Up Car Park<br>
    </b>At long last the car park has been improved with the levelling of the surface. This has taken a considerable time to get done but we had to wait for the completion of the laying of the new sewer pipeline as the contractors were crossing the area to get to their site. Murphys, as main contractors to Thames Water, have now done a good job on the car park. They have also reinstated the track they made to get to the working area at the far side of the cricket field. In the course of those works they have purchased and removed the turf and top soil from the area where we intend to construct a Multi Use Games Area for our young people.</font>.
