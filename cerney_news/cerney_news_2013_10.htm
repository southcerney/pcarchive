      <P align="left"><B>PRECEPT MEETING</B> </P>All residents are invited to attend a public meeting on Wednesday 13th November at 8 pm in the Village Hall. The meeting is to explain how the Parish Council makes its financial plans for the coming fiscal year starting April 2014. It will be shown how a grant from the Parish Council could help the aspirations of local groups which have the best interests of the Parish of South Cerney with Cerney Wick in mind. Parish Councillors will gauge the feelings of villagers if there should be a need to increase the amount collected in Council Tax which is currently £45.18 a year for a Band D dwelling If a club or recognised grouping are intending to make a bid for a grant it is vitally important that a representative is present at the meeting. Be advised that failure to attend the meeting may exclude any bid for a grant.

      <P align="left"><B>OVERGROWING HEDGES</B> </P>Every year this problem persists. The Parish Council does not wish to be over zealous in its insistence that residents who let their hedges inconvenience other members of the parish, including those in Cerney Wick, should take responsibility and cut them back. It is a last resort in writing to individuals who do not conform to show consideration for this property husbandry. Consequently could all residents who have hedges overgrowing public footpaths please make an effort to cut them back.

      <P align="left"><B>R-WAY REPORT</B>
      </P>R-Way’s summer finished off with some Bushcraft sessions at Cotswold Forest School for both youth groups and a BBQ at the beginning of September. The BBQ was very successful – thanks must go to Johno Kimberley for his excellent chef skills! Young people, parents and community members came along to view the photographs of the young people’s activities over the summer. Luckily the weather was beautiful. We’re now in the process of putting together our programme between now and Christmas. This includes a residential exercise for 10 young people to Skern Lodge in Devon over a weekend in October. Other activities planned for this term include trips, craft sessions, health issue based sessions, Halloween and Christmas parties.

      <P align="left"><B>UPPER UP CAR PARK</B> </P>Due to the prohibitive cost the Parish Council decided not to embark on a grand scale refurbishment of the surface of the car park. Instead it will concentrate on scarifying, levelling and compacting the ground on a regular basis.

      <P align="left"><B>MEETING TO DISCUSS THE FLOODING PROBLEM</B> </P>Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP will host a public Flood Resilience Meeting at 9.30 am on Friday 18th October in the Village Hall where representatives of all the many authorities and Thames Water will be present to report on what progress has been achieved towards improving the situation. Residents are welcome and encouraged to attend.

      <P align="left"><B>EARLY EVENINGS</B> </P>As the seasons progress, the lighting up time becomes ever earlier. In the interests of safety, cyclists especially should suitably attire themselves with high visibility jackets and have their bikes adequately lit, primarily to be seen by other road users.

      <P align="left"><B>RECRUITMENT OF YOUTH & COMMUNITY CENTRE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE</B> </P>It is anticipated that the new centre will be completed in mid 2015 and with that in view the Parish Council would like to hear from anyone interested in coordinating the activities and generally managing the scheme. Nothing as yet has been decided on how to run the centre but it is hoped that people with an interest in its well-being will come forward and become involved directly with the organisation.
