    <p align="left">

Every year concern is expressed about overhanging trees, hedges and shrubs as these may sometimes cause inconvenience to pedestrians. The Parish Council would be most grateful if householders could trim any overhanging hedges, trees etc. that may be causing an inconvenience to the public and traffic using the adjacent carriageway or pathway.<p align="left">


    <b>UPPER UP TREE PLANTING</b>
    <p align="left">

What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of significance in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a park seat installed on the Upper Up recreation field? For further information please contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812.</td>
