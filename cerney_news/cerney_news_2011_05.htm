<p align="left"><b>ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUM 2011</b> </p>

    There will not be an election for Parish Councillors in May as the present Parish Council has been returned unopposed. Cllr Julian Caunce who served the Parish Council as Chairman of the Playing Fields and Village Maintenance Committee is standing down. Members of the Parish Council would like to thank him for his excellent contribution to Parish matters over the 8 years he has been a Parish Councillor and wish him well in the future. It has been confirmed that the UK Parliamentary Voting System Referendum will be held on the same day as our District Council Elections, Thursday 5th May 2011. All residents of voting age are encouraged to use their vote in the interests of democracy.

<p align="left"><b>YOUTH GROUP</b> </p>
Members of the youth in the parish have formed themselves into a group to be known as "R-Way" and agreed a constitution. Chris Wearing is Chairman, Jack Stratford is Treasurer and Jasmin Tresadern is Secretary. There are various activities planned and all youths are encouraged to take part. For example there is a rock climbing course, a cinema night, an Easter egg hunt and a bush craft exercise to mention just a few of the exciting events available. About 30 youths are involved and all are welcome. So contact one of the above committee members and join in the fun.
