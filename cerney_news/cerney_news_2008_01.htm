    <font size="4"><b>EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE PARISH COUNCIL<br>
    </b>Following the heavy rain on Tuesday 22nd and Wednesday 23rd January the Parish Council met in emergency session on Wednesday evening and agreed to install a culvert across the bridleway on the old railway line near the Robert Franklin Way playing field in order to relieve the build-up of water flowing under the bridge. The river was at least seven inches above the top of the bridge arch and riverside properties were close to inundation. More properties in Robert Franklin Way were also under threat if the river overflowed its banks. At the time further rainfall was forecast and there were warnings from the Environment Agency that flooding was expected on rivers from South Cerney to Lechlade. The culvert was completed on Friday afternoon and within a short period a drop in the river level was noticeable. Thankfully the heavy rains did not arrive and the culvert will give reassurance to those residents in this part of the village that due to the prompt action by the Parish Council a potential disastrous incident had been averted.</font>

    <font size="4"><b>PARISH COUNCIL PRECEPT<br>
    </b>After careful budgeting the Parish Council agreed a precept which will mean a decrease of £1,455 from last year's figure.</font>.

    <font size="4"><b>HIGHWAY RESURFACING<br>
    </b>Although it is regrettable that Gloucestershire Highways have decided to postpone the resurfacing work in Broadway Lane and Silver Street their reasoning is that as new sewer pipes have to be laid it is better to wait for that scheme to be completed. In the meantime remedial work will be carried out to improve the potholes.</font>.

    <font size="4"><b>UPPER UP TREE PLANTING<br>
    </b>What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of significance in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a park seat installed on the Upper Up recreation field? For further information please contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812.</font>.
