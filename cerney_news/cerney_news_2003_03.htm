    FIRST DEPOSIT RESPONSE</b></p>
    <p>The Parish Council objected to the CDC that no mention had been made on the future of
    the CAMAS site in the Local Plan First Deposit and recommended that the area be considered
    as a public amenity or open space and be specifically designated for community purposes.
    It also recommended that paragraph 9.18 expressly acknowledges the rapidly increasing
    impact of traffic on the village as industrial sites develop.</p>
    <p>It further objected that there is no express designation of public open spaces, green
    lungs, community amenity land or historic landscapes in South Cerney. It recommended that
    the following areas be designated under Policy 11: remainder of Jubilee Gardens open
    spaces; Robert Franklin Way playing field; The Piece (alongside Station Road); the .grass
    area in front of the Village Hall in School Lane; both areas of allotments in the village;
    Upper Up playing fields; the old railway line; the Scout Hut plot and adjoining play area
    in Berkeley Close and the wide verges and open grass area in Berkeley Close. Under Policy
    12 the .areas numbered 1 and 5 in the South Cerney Conservation Area . Statement should be
    specifically incorporated in the Local Plan.</p>
    <p>The full text of the Parish Council's response may be accessed on the web site on 13
    March, which is the day after the Parish Council approves the Minutes of its February
    meeting.</font> </td>
