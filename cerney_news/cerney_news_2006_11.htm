    <font size="4"><b>STATION ROAD RESURFACING</b></font><br>
    Resurfacing work from the eastern end of the village limits out to the Spine
Road is programmed to begin on 13th December and should be finished by
20th December 2006. The road will be closed whilst the work takes place, but
access for residents, pedestrians and emergency vehicles will still be available.
Gloucestershire Highways Project Manager Nigel Overal said: "We are laying
a whole new surface to this section of Station Road and motorists should
notice a real difference once works are complete. We ask drivers to be patient
whilst the road is closed and remind people to allow a little bit of extra time
for journeys. We will make sure that diversions are clearly signed." The works
are taking place in early December so that they don’t affect sewer
improvements at the other end of Station Road in the New Year.</p>

    Parents are asked to remind their children that it is an offence to ride these
bikes on footpaths or public highways. The Parish Council is not in favour of
these bikes being used on its playing fields. Facilities are available however at
an indoor centre at RAF Hullavington and at the bottom of Blunsdon Hill,
near Swindon.</p>
