<p align="left"><b>SOUTH CERNEY OUTDOOR EDUCATION CENTRE (SCOEC)</b> </p>
The Parish Council is keen to work with all appropriate groups interested in continuing the operation of SCOEC. Gloucestershire County Council is actively seeking a suitable organisation to take over the running of the centre as due to cut backs, it cannot continue to run the centre. However, assurances have been given that the lake and surrounds are not being sold for development.

Phoenix Charitable Trust has very generously donated £200 to help with the provision of a defibrillator in South Cerney. Anyone else willing to contribute towards the cost of this unit should contact our Parish Clerk Maurice McKee 01285 644864.

Legislation recently changed the system of how long term planning is carried out. All current Local Plans will, over time, be replaced by Local Development Frameworks (LDF's). Over the past two years or so, CDC Planners have been working on the preparation of the new LDF for their area during which time they have widely consulted all manner of groups and individuals. Everyone is encouraged to see the new LDF and to make comment before 31st March 2011 using the web link as below
