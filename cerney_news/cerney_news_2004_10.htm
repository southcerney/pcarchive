    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">DID YOU KNOW THAT CERNEY HAS ITS OWN LAKE?</font><br>
    We have had several people complain that there is nowhere in the parish for 
    them to walk around a lake as virtually all lakes and their surrounds are in 
    private ownership and closed to the general public. Well, there is one that 
    everyone can get to and enjoy because we all own it.<br>
    It is at the far end of the wiggly footpath at the Upper Up recreation 
    field, just beyond the cricket pitch. It is not massive but it is in a 
    quiet, peaceful location and as the margins are colonised by rushes 
    and&nbsp;other plants, it becomes increasingly attractive each passing season.<br>
    Already there are ducks and geese enjoying it and there is no reason 
    whatsoever why you shouldn't do so as well. Go on, see for yourself.<br>

    <font size="4">WHY NOT PLANT A TREE TO REMEMBER A SPECIAL PERSON<br>
    OR EVENT?</font><br>
    Over the next year or so, the Parish Council are to plant trees and shrubs 
    to complete the Upper Up Park. Included in the scheme will be some 50 or 60 
    specimen trees such as oaks, limes, aspens etc.&nbsp;They will vary in size but 
    the larger ones will be about 10-ft or so and will make a marked&nbsp;impact on 
    the area.<br>
    Trees make wonderful memorials and you can pay for one or more to remember a 
    special person or event in your life. Each tree will have a plaque saying 
    who or what is being commemorated. Prices vary depending on species and 
    size. For full information, contact James Harris on 01285 861812.</b></p>
