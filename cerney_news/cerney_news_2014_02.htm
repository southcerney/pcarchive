      <P align="left"><B>FLOODING</B> </P>
      Although our parish was threatened with severe flooding over Christmas
into early January, thankfully few dwellings actually had water enter their
living accommodation. The flood relief works at the old railway
embankment at Robert Franklin Way carried out in 2012/13 kept the level
of the river Churn at the same maximum height as the previous
emergency. Also the more recent renewal of fractured drain pipes at
Upper Up prevented any re-occurrence of the highway being flooded in
the built-up area. Unfortunately, the sewers and the pumping stations
owned by Thames Water proved to be incapable of dealing with the
excess water draining into them. Far too many households had sewage
backing up making life very difficult. This time it seems that problems
were experienced over a wider part of the village and it would be helpful
if those who had problems could contact Parish Council to report what
happened. This information is needed to convince the authorities that
works have to be done to improve the situation. The Parish Council does
not and cannot provide sand bags or other flood prevention aids. If you
live in an area liable to flooding, you must make you own arrangements.

      <P align="left"><B>REPOSITIONING OF THE WAR MEMORIAL</B></P>
      The repositioning of the War Memorial as required to improve the safety
of the High Street with Broadway Lane junction will take place over the
next few weeks. Sometime in February the Memorial will be dismantled
and removed to a stonemason's yard for cleaning and renovation while
the new road junction is constructed. The Memorial will then be rebuilt
in its new position approximately four metres nearer the cottage. It is
planned that the works should be completed by the end of April. The
improvements to the junction of Spine Road with Broadway Lane are due
to commence in April/May and should take approximately four weeks to
finish.

      <P align="left"><B>NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR’S COUNCIL TAX PRECEPT</B> </P>
      The Parish Council has accepted the recommendation of its Finance
Committee regarding the precept for the forthcoming financial year, April
2014 to March 2015. Through prudent management of resources and
tight budgetary control the Parish Council has been able to set a precept
which will result in a small increase in the base Band “D” demand of 86p
annually. The Parish Council will support several community groups
through the Village Plan scheme. Those who will benefit include Cerney
Wick replacement play equipment, the South Cerney Art Group, South
Cerney Youth and Adult Football clubs, South Cerney Scouts, South
Cerney Street Fair and the Centenary Commemorations for World War I.
Other smaller donations will be made to groups which will be decided at
the March meeting of the Parish Council. The approved budget can be
viewed on www.southcerney.org.uk

      <P align="left"><B>WORLD WAR I COMMEMORATIONS</B></P>
      The Parish Council appeals for any relative of those who fell during the
	  1914–1918 World War who may have memorabilia or photographs and
	  willing to lend them to the Parish Council for display to contact Cllr
Peter Jay on 860641.

      <P align="left"><B>EMERGENCY PLAN</B> </P>
Working with a large team of volunteers from the community, the Parish
Council is setting up an Emergency Plan. Working with both CDC and
Gloucestershire County Council advisors and representatives from
Bromford Housing Association, it is intended that the Plan will cover
most eventualities for any disaster that might affect the parish. Further
details will be reported in this and other publications in due course.

      <P align="left"><B>2013 SOUTH CERNEY WITH CERNEY WICK PARISH PLAN</B></P>
Over the page is a list of objectives adopted by the Parish Council at last
month’s meeting for inclusion in the new Parish Plan. This will form the
mandate for schemes over the next few years. This Plan is the most
recent of a series of Plans. It is pleasing to see that a majority of
objectives in previous plans have been achieved.
