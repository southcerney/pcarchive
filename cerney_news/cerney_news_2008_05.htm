    <font size="4"><b>BLEDISLOE CUP INSPECTION<br>

If successful the second round will be between 19th July and 3rd August The final round will take place in early September, The judges will be looking for evidence of local pride and for communities which have made their surroundings as pleasant and attractive as they can. Judges will make appropriate allowances for villages which face special difficulties or temporary disruption such as road works.</font>

    <font size="4"><b>LAKESIDE RECREATION AREA<br>
    </b>The refurbishment of the Lakeside car park area on Station Road will be completed on 6th June. Many will be relieved that the facility has been finally upgraded. The Cotswold Water Park Society is to be congratulated for the innovative way it has allowed for the management of wildlife, especially at the edge of the lake.</font>.
    </p>
    <font size="4"><b>CYCLING ON FOOTPATHS<br>
    </b>Once again inconsiderate cyclists must be reminded that the public footpaths throughout the village are for the exclusive use of pedestrians. Cyclists should not ride their bikes on these paths particularly where signs prohibit the activity. It is dangerous to do so but more especially where residents' front doors open on to the pathway. Recently one elderly resident narrowly escaped serious injury when a cyclist passed by on the footpath just as the person left the property.</font>

    <font size="4"><b>PCSO<br>
    </b>PCSO Lesley Pooley has been transferred to Lechlade and Fairford. The Parish Council wishes her well in her new appointment. PCSO Michael Owen continues to look after this area and will be joined by a new PCSO in the near future.</font>.
