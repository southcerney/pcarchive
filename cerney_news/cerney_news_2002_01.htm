    <p><font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Precept for year April 2002 ­ March 2003</strong></big></font><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to precept £46,000 upon the Council Tax Collection Fund to
    finance expenditure planned in the coming year. The Parish Council voted 9 in favour with
    2 abstentions to increase the budget for the coming year by £14,460 which represents an
    increase of 91p per calendar month for band OD' households. It is planned to start work on
    a leisure park on Upper Up playing fields and the extra precept will enable groundwork to
    begin once the plans have been passed by the Cotswold District Council.<br>

    <font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>Disabled Access</strong></big></font><br>
    Confirmation has been received from the contractor that work on the disabled access ramp
    at Upper Up will start on the week beginning 27 May 2002.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><big><strong>New Street Lights</strong></big></font><br>
    Recently three new street lights have been installed in the village, two of which are in
    Bow Wow and the other in Berkeley Close opposite the Scout Hut. In Station Road, on a
    trial basis, the objective is to increase the illumination level on the carriageway
    without creating unacceptable glare from the lanterns. Existing low pressure sodium
    lamp/lantern combinations (stark orange light out-put) are to be gradually replaced in
    favour of high pressure sodium lamp/lantern combinations. This will rationalise the type
    of lamp/lantern combinations in the village but because of the improved optical control of
    emitted light will reduce light pollution (sky glow) and the whiter light will improve the
    comfort factor, particularly for pedestrians. This work is part of a 3­4 year programme
    to rationalise the type of lamp/lantern combinations throughout South Cerney. Parish
    Councillors agreed to contribute to the costs of these improvements. </td>
