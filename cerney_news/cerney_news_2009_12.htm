    &nbsp;<p align="left"><b>NEW ALLOTMENTS</b> <br>
    Following the great disappointment of the refusal of the owners of the old 
    allotments at the end of School Lane to reopen these, it has now been agreed 
    that Parish Council is to look into the feasibility of using the land behind 
    the tennis courts at Upper Up as allotment gardens. It is likely that we 
    could provide at least a dozen plots on the site. We already have a good 
    idea of the number of people wanting allotments in the village but if you 
    are interested but have not already contacted anyone, please ring Mike 
    Stuart 860439. </p>
    <p align="left"><b>PLAYING FIELD OF THE YEAR AWARD <br>
    </b>The Upper Up playing field was judged as Runner Up in a competition 
    organised by Gloucestershire Playing Fields Association (GPFA) and won a 
    prize of £75. On behalf of the Parish Council, Chairman Mike Stuart accepted 
    the cheque and a commemorative plaque at the AGM of the GPFA in Tewkesbury.

    <p align="left"><b>TV SWITCHOVER</b> <br>
    Peter Watson from Digital UK will be in attendance at the Village Hall from 
    2pm until 6pm on January 21st to give a running presentation and answer all 
    questions regarding the forthcoming switchover from analogue to digital 
    television reception. </p>
    <p align="left"><b>UPPER UP TREE PLANTING</b> <br>
    What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of significance 
    in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a park seat 
    installed on the Upper Up recreation field? For further information please 
    contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812. </p>
    <p align="left"><b>SEASON’S GREETINGS</b> <br>
    The Chairman, Vice Chairman, Parish Councillors and Clerk wish the residents 
    of South Cerney and Cerney Wick a very happy Christmas and best wishes for 
    the New Year.</td>
