<p align="left"><b>R-WAY COMMITTEE</b> </p>
This youth group, supported by the Parish Council, is now established in the village and is doing valuable volunteer work in the community. It has taken over from Mr Wrightson, who for many years kept the open ditch in Station Road free from rubbish. It is also involved in managing the compost material on the Upper Up playing fields. The group is currently advertising for a youth worker to coordinate its activities. It is also looking for more recruits to join in the fun and games. If you are 13 years old and up to 19 years you will be made very welcome. The group meets on Monday evenings at 6 o'clock mainly outside Londis and go from there to wherever for its activities. Contact Chris Wearing on mobile: 07581698353 (<a href="mailto:wickedwearing123@hotmail.co.uk">wickedwearing123@hotmail.co.uk</a>) or Jasmin Tresadern (<a href="mailto:jasmin_tresadern@hotmail.com">jasmin_tresadern@hotmail.com</a>) for further information.
