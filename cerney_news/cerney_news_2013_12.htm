      <P align="left"><B>FLOODING UPDATE</B> </P>Following the severe problems with backed up drains and overflowing
waterways during the flood emergency last winter the Parish Council
has been working with many agencies to minimise future
reoccurrences. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP has been leading attempts
to get Thames Water and the Environment Agency to carry out
remedial works to pipes and water courses. He has held two Flooding
Resilience meetings in the village hall and at the most recent
demanded that Thames Water take more steps than have been carried
out so far. The Environment Agency has approved the continued use
of the spillway dug across the old rail track by Parish Council and
piped by Glos Highways and have agreed to remove some gravel from
the river. Thames Water has installed electronic flow meters in some
main sewers to monitor potential emergencies as well as sealing lids
on manholes in areas likely to flood.<p>A further public meeting will be held in April 2014 to ensure that
improvement works continue. Notes of the two previous meetings can
be read on the Parish Council web site www.southcerney.org.uk </p>

      <P align="left"><B>R WAY UPDATE</B>
      </P>The R Way youth group has two new assistant leaders as Jasmin
Tresadern and Chris Wearing both passed their professional
qualifications after attending a six month long training course run by
Young Gloucestershire. A grant from Cotswold District Council
financed the training and the transport. Chris and Jasmin are long term
members of the R Way group and Chris is also a member of the Parish
Council.

      <P align="left"><B>EMERGENCY PLAN</B> </P>To ensure that the community is able to deal with any future crisis, an
Emergency Plan is being prepared by a team of local people assisted
by Gloucestershire Community Council. Details will be circulated at a
later date but in the meantime it is strongly recommended that every
one living in those parts of our village where flooding may occur
should take immediate steps to purchase their own sandbags and
consider having flood barriers fitted to all external doors. The
likelihood of there being supplies of free sandbags in future
emergencies is remote so please take action now.

      <P align="left"><B>THE UPPER UP PLAYING FIELD</B> </P>The Upper Up playing field, totally owned by the Parish Council was
judged as being runner up in the annual Gloucestershire Playing Fields
Association’s Playing Field of the Year contest and a prize of £50 was
awarded to the Parish Council.
Work has started on the replacement of the equipment at the play
ground owned by the people of Cerney Wick following some excellent
fund raising plus grants from the Parish Council and from other sources.

      <P align="left"><B>HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS</B>
      </P>A search of the hidden corners of Village Hall storage unearthed a
very interesting collection of village papers. A full set of minute books
recording every Parish Council meeting from its start in 1897 to when
records went onto the computer were discovered. These will be taken
to Gloucestershire Records at the end of January for safe keeping.
Until then should anyone wish to inspect them please contact Mike
Stuart on 01285 860439.<p>We have also found all the minute books of the Village Hall
Committee going back to 1922 when the barn, as it was then, was
given to the village for conversion into the Hall. Some of the
problems and situations recorded in these records make interesting
reading.</p>
