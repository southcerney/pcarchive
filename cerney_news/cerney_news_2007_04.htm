    <font size="4"><b>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE USE YOUR VOTE IN THE ELECTION ON 3RD
MAY</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">For the first time in many years we have more candidates than available
seats in the elections for both the Parish Council and the CDC. Please
support your local candidates by using your vote. Parish Councillors
can and do make a marked difference to the way in which your village
is run and over the past few years we have seen an increase in public
support in Cerney for our efforts. Please <u><b>VOTE</b></u> on May 3rd.
</p>
    <font size="4"><b>ANNUAL PARISH MEETING</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">Make a note in your diary to come to the parish Annual Meeting at the
Village Hall on Wednesday 16th May. This is your chance to hear
reports from and ask questions of the Parish Council and several village
groups plus from District and County Councillors, the Police etc. This
is an open meeting and all are invited.</p>

    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>SEWER PIPELINE</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">Work has started on this long awaited scheme. There will be some
disruption but it will be worth it.</p>

    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>DOG MESS</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">Although in general there has been a marked improvement in this
problem recently we have noticed that plastic bags containing dog mess
are being left around the village. This is not only illegal but is very
antisocial and whoever is doing it is liable to being fined in court.
Please stop it now!</p>

    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>RECYCLING OF CLOTHING AND FABRICS</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">Do not forget that we now have a Salvation Army’s clothing recycling
container at the Upper Up car park next to the Plastic Bottle Bin.</p>
