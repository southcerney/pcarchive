    <p align="left">What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of
significance in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a
park seat installed on the Upper Up recreation field? For further
information please contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812.

    <p align="left">Thames Water has unfortunately had to postpone the start of its
refurbishment programme. Due to above average rainfall for the last
three months and the predicted rainfall for January and February, the
ground water levels recorded at the nearby monitoring borehole are
very high. As the majority of the pipeline routes are through farmland,
adjacent to open water and alongside the village cricket pitch it is
considered prudent to defer the start on site for a few weeks until
March by which time the ground water level situation should have
improved as should the weather. A review by Thames Water has
concluded that it can still deliver the rising main replacement element
of the project by the end of the summer and the sewer flooding
alleviation element before next winter. It will also give a better
indication on progress with CDC in respect of the planning application
for the new pumping station – which is essential for the whole project.
Thames Water is aware that residents may be disappointed at a slightly
later than expected start but the rainfall since the meeting on the 13th,
the current ground water situation together with Met Office predictions
for the next 2 months, combined with other matters detailed above, all
point to a deferred start being a sensible decision for all parties.</p>
