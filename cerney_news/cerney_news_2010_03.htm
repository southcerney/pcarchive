    <p align="left"><b>AED (AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR)</b> </p>

    <p align="left">The Parish Council is minded to provide an automatic external defibrillator unit for use in South Cerney. This portable equipment is capable of providing essential life saving treatment by members of the general public with only modest training. With our emergency services being stretched and traffic conditions making it virtually impossible for ambulances and para medics to reach the scene of a heart attack victim within 15 minutes let alone the crucial 8 minutes of a heart attack it makes sense for the strategic placement of portable defibrillators in places where the public gather and to offer immediate response to saving a life whether it be an adult or a child. The Parish Council is actively seeking financial contributions from residents and local business to provide one or maybe two of these units.</p>

    <p align="left">If you are interested in any aspect of this cause please contact Cllr Philip Nicholas (01285) 860736 during the evening. </p>

    <p align="left"><b>REMOVAL OF RECYCLING BINS FROM UPPER UP CAR PARK</b>

    <p align="left">The Parish Council would like to stress that it is fully in favour of the recycling efforts of the Cotswold District Council and totally supports the scheme. Unfortunately the positioning of the bins at Upper Up and their popular use has been responsible for the current state of the surface of the car park. In order to reinstate the parking and access to the playing fields the Parish Council had to request that the bins are removed.</td>
