<p align="left"><b>COMPOSTING SCHEME AT UPPER UP PLAY AREA</b> </p>

Recently unmanageable amounts of garden material have been left at the composting site at Upper Up. If large shrubs or leylandii pruning bits cannot fit into a green bin as supplied by Cotswold District Council then it should not be taken to the composting site either. Recent abuse of the scheme has meant that the only way to dispose of these large amounts is to burn it which totally defeats the object of converting the mass to compost..
