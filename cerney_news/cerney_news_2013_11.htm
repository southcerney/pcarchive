      <P align="left"><B>VILLAGE PLAN</B> </P>At its meeting in October the Parish Council voted unanimously to
adopt the new Parish Plan. Helen Richards (GRCC), who advised
the Parish Council on its content will prepare a large display version
which can be viewed in the Village Hall in the near future.

      <P align="left"><B>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOUNDARY COMMISSION</B>
      </P>The Parish Council responded to the consultation on new ward
boundaries stating that the arbitrary numerical equation to divide
the district into manageable wards was flawed in relation to South
Cerney. On projected calculations South Cerney would be too large
for one ward and part would have to be syphoned off, or another part of the 
      district would be cobbled to it, in order that two representatives could 
      be allocated. The changes envisaged did not enhance the democratic 
      representation and was an unnecessary expense in these austere times. The 
      treatment proposed was demeaning and should be resisted.<P align="left"><B>VILLAGE FLOODING</B> </P>The Parish Council is continuing its discussions with statutory
bodies including Thames Water, Gloucestershire County Council,
Environment Agency and Cotswold District Council on how to
alleviate or even remedy the constant threat of flooding in times of
heavy rainfall. The Parish Council, with the help of local
individuals, constantly badgers the authorities for answers to
potential water flow problems.

      <P align="left"><B>PRECEPT MEETING</B> </P>Invitations have been sent out to all clubs and societies who may
have a cause to request a grant from the Precept. Applicants
intending to make a bid must attend the meeting to qualify. Please
remember that the public meeting will take place on <b>Wednesday
13th November at 8 pm</b> in the Village Hall.

      <P align="left"><B>R-WAY REPORT</B> </P>R-Way’s membership is flourishing under the guidance of Mrs
Emily Hallett, Jai Cunningham, Jasmin Tresadern and Chris
Wearing. Eleven young people will be attending a residential course
at Skern Lodge. The average attendance at local events was 10–15
from the senior group and at least 15 juniors. There are Halloween
and Christmas parties planned. Road safety issues for the older
group are regularly discussed. The juniors take part in bushcraft
sessions at Cotswold Forest School under the guidance of Johno
Kimberley.

      <P align="left"><B>NEW FACILITY AT THE MALLARDS</B> </P>Plans continue to evolve and members of the sub-committee meet
on a regular basis with the design architects. The foot print of the
building has now been decided and the planning of the interior
layout can proceed.

      <P align="left"><B>SUCCESS FOR CERNEY WICK'S APPLICATION FOR GRANTS TO EQUIP ITS PLAYING FIELD</B>
      </P>Jenny Pegler has been spectacularly successful in acquiring grants
for the re-equipping of the play area in Cerney Wick. The Parish
Council congratulated Jenny on her efforts which will be fully
explained at the Precept Meeting on Wednesday 13th November.
Jenny is a wonderful example of how the Parish Council and viable
schemes can cooperate to secure elusive funding for worthwhile
projects.
