    <font size="4"><b>ANNUAL PARISH MEETING<br>
    </b>The Annual Parish Meeting will be held in the village hall on Wednesday 21st May at 7.30pm. This is your chance to hear reports from and ask questions of the main bodies and organisations in your village. Speakers will include representatives of the police, Army, churches, school and Parish Council.</font>
    <p>
    <font size="4"><b>NEW HEDGE<br>
    </b>As part of the Cotswold Water Park biodiversity project Parish Council has re-planted the hedge between the cricket field and the pond area at Upper Up. This will not only give an attractive hedge but will also provide cover for numerous forms of wildlife. Financial assistance for this project came from the 106 Agreement relating to the Four Pillars hotel via the CDC.</font>.
    </p>
    <font size="4"><b>BLEDISLOE CUP<br>
    </b>Once again we are competing in the Bledisloe Cup Competition for the Best Kept Village in Gloucestershire. So far this century we have been extremely successful, having won the main prize twice, so let's go for the hat-trick! This will mean being extra vigilant in the picking up of litter and keeping the fronts of our properties as tidy as possible.</font>.
    <p>
    <font size="4"><b>DOG MESS<br>
    </b>Last month Councillor Clive Bennett of the CDC wrote in this magazine about the anti-social people who fail to clean up after their dogs. Very soon new legislation comes into force making it easier for the Council to prosecute offenders. Be very aware that the new Cotswold Community Wardens now employed will be taking steps to prosecute these very few inconsiderate people. The majority of owners do clean up after their dogs.</font>.
    </p>
    <font size="4"><b>NEW SEWER PIPELINE<br>
    </b>Reinstatement of the surface, especially at Upper Up playing fields, will be taking place in the near future. However it will be several months before the scar has healed and the security fencing can be removed.</font>.
