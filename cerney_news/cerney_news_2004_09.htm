    <font size="4">ZEBRA CROSSING</font><br>
    The Parish Council at its latest meeting held on 8 September at the Village 
    Hall decided, after a vote, to ask GCC Highways to consider the installation 
    of a zebra crossing in High Street. The Parish Council voted 8 in favour, 1 
    against and 1 abstention. The motion was therefore carried.<br>

    <font size="4">FLOODING</font><br>
    The Parish Council agreed to support residents throughout the village but 
    especially those a the ends prone to flooding in their quest to find a 
    solution. A recent application to build houses in Berkeley Close was 
    objected to for the following reasons. The Parish Council is profoundly 
    concerned that permission to build was being sought on this site. Thames 
    Water plc, the Environment Agency, Cotswold District Council and Fosseway 
    Housing should demonstrate that the original problems of sewerage and 
    surface water disposal had been addressed. The public open space on the plan 
    is not an effective replacement for the existing play area next to the scout 
    hut. The Parish Council agreed to request a Condition, if permission was 
    granted, that 40% of the dwellings should be allocated as affordable 
    housing. In reply to a series of questions to the above 4 agencies, of 
    particular concern was the admission by Thames Water plc that conclusions 
    from the study of the severe flooding in 2000–2001 are not yet available and 
    any solutions which may be proposed will need to be carefully considered. 
    The CDC should not consider any planning application in this area until the 
    report is complete. As Thames Water plc will not adopt the sewage 
    infrastructure presently managed by Fosseway the housing association should 
    be encouraged to upgrade its inadequate drainage system with some of the 
    proceeds from the sale of the land in Berkeley Close. The Parish Council 
    agreed to support Mr &amp; Mrs Chapman and the other residents of Berkeley Close 
    at every opportunity in their quest to find a solution. There was further 
    concern at the amount of new applications in the Parish which if granted 
    would add to the already overloaded system.</b></p>
