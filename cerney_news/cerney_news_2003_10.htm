    <p align="left">Under the terms of its insurance policy the Parish Council is responsible
    for inspecting the play equipment installed on the play areas on a weekly basis. At one of
    these inspections Cllr Stuart noticed that the cross member supporting the cradle seats of
    the Junior Swing was damaged. Further investigation revealed that the cross over pole was
    rotten and in danger of collapse. Parish Council Chairman Cllr Stuart along with Vice
    Chairman of the Parish Council Cllr Squire and Cllr Harris removed the pole which will be
    replaced in the near future.</p>
    <p align="left">The collection of litter left at the play areas is a continual battle and
    the Parish Council decided to contract a person to collect light rubbish throughout the
    village on the basis of one hour per day Monday to Friday. It would make his task so much
    easier if parents would ask their children to use the litter bins provided and not to
    spread it indiscriminately.</p>
    <p align="center"><u><big><strong>GRASS CUTTING</strong></big></u></p>
    <p align="left">Lee Ponting was appointed to carry out ground maintenance on the public
    areas throughout the village for the remainder of the season.</p>
    <p align="center"><big><u><strong>UPPER UP PARK</strong></u></big></p>
    <p align="left">The Parish Council is pleased to note that the cycle mounds erected at the
    far end of Upper Up play area have been in constant use.</p>
    <p align="center"><big><u><strong>BUDGET</strong></u></big></p>
    <p align="left">At its meeting in November the Parish Council will be discussing next
    year's spending plans for the village. If any resident has a constructive idea which might
    be considered in the plan, please contact any Parish Councillor.</td>
