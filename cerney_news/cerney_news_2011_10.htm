<p align="left"><b>R-WAY</b> </p>
The youth group came out in force to clean up the play equipment on Robert Franklin Way play area. The Parish Council on behalf of the community thanks them for their efforts. Well done!
</p>

<p align="left"><b>REGISTERING SEPTIC TANKS WITH ENVIRONMENT AGENCY</b> </p>

The notice in last month's Cerney News about registering septic tanks had been provided erroneously and should be disregarded.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>DOG WASTE BINS</b> </p>

A new dog waste bin will be installed at the western end of Riverway footpath. Also, the one in Clarks Hay which is very little used will be re-positioned at the end of the road section of Ham Lane.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>UPPER UP USERS</b> </p>

The Chairman of the Parish Council, Councillor Mike Stuart had a very productive meeting with representatives of the clubs which use the facilities provided at the Upper Up playing field. Various inter-related topics including the sharing of water charges, dog mess on the playing areas, the car park arrangements, its refurbishment and vandalism problems were discussed in a very congenial manner. The Parish Council favours such meetings as it believes it cements relationships with the local clubs which can encourage their development and participation in the community.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>OVERGROWN HEDGES</b> </p>
    Every year this perennial problem persists. The Parish Council does not wish 
    to be over zealous in its insistence that residents who let their hedges 
    inconvenience other members of the parish, including those in Cerney Wick, 
    should take responsibility and cut them back. It is a last resort in writing 
    to individuals who do not conform to show consideration in this property 
    husbandry. Consequently could all residents who have hedges overgrowing 
    public footpaths please make an effort and cut them back.
