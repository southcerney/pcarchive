<p align="left"><b>STANDARDS BOARD ENQUIRY INTO THE BEHAVIOUR OF CLLR JENKINS (WATER PARK WARD)	</b> </p>

Cllr Nicholas said at the Parish Council meeting that the whole Standards Board episode had been a disproportionate over-reaction. Cllr Stuart said it had brought Cotswold District Council into disrepute and ridicule. Cllr Webb suggested that the action was politically motivated, to cause Cllr Jenkins (CDC) harm and distress. He said the public had a right to know how much money the fiasco had cost the taxpayer, wasting money in these austere times and diverting funds from essential services.
    <p>Cllr Jenkins said that the bundle of documents was in the order of 1,500 pages, having taken over 200 hours just to read, and that the 92 pages of summary had taken a senior lawyer ten days to prepare. Cllr Nicholas said that CDC had spent a huge amount of energy on "shooting the messenger" instead of addressing the underlying issues. An absence of proper leadership had been shown by senior CDC officers, with no attempt having been made at mediation. Cllr Kimberley said it was wrong that no apology had been made to Cllr Jenkins, recognising the unnecessary distress to his wife and family.
    </p>
    <p>It had been proposed by Cllr Nicholas and seconded by Cllr Stuart that this Parish Council has complete faith in Cllr Jenkins, and that it should write to Mr Nuedegg and Cllr Stowe saying the action taken by Cotswold District Council against Cllr Jenkins had been disproportionate and excessive, and gave the appearance of an arrogant complacency over the real issues that concerned local residents. The Parish Council was unanimously in favour.

The Parish Council wishes to sincerely thank each and every person who had contributed to this worthy cause. At the Parish Council meeting £1,550 had been received and more was promised. Although the target for the purchase and installation had not been quite achieved the Parish Council voted to stand by its commitment and make up any shortfall in the cost. Arrangements were being processed to 
    install the kit.
