    <font size="4"><b>SARA MEETING<br>
    </b></font>The next SARA meeting will take place on January 15th at 7.30pm in the Village Hall, School Lane. If you are interested or concerned with the level of policing in the village, for example anti social behaviour, speeding traffic, inconsiderate parking on kerbs or whatever, now is your chance to make your views known to those responsible for upholding the law. At its meeting on 14th November the subject of speeding motorists on Cirencester Road was the problem which was causing most concern and the police should make a report on how it is intended to curb this behaviour.<p>

    <font size="4"><b>UPPER UP TREE PLANTING<br>
    </b></font>What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of significance in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a park seat installed on the Upper Up recreation field? For further information please contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812.<p>

    <font size="4"><b>SEASON'S GREETINGS<br>
    </b></font>The Chairman, Vice Chairman, Parish Councillors and Clerk wish the residents of South Cerney and Cerney Wick a very happy Christmas and best wishes for the New Year.
