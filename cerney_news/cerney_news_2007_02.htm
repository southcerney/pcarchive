    <font size="4"><b>REPORTING VANDALISM</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">Once again vandals have been disfiguring our bus shelter, outside the Limes at the junction of Clarks Hay, High Street and Station Road, by spraying paint on its walls. This mindless activity is expensive to clean up and is a burden on every Council Tax payer in the community. If any one is aware who is to blame it is their civic duty to inform the police accordingly. Useful telephone numbers to report any such incidents are as follows:<br>
Cirencester Police 0845 090 1234, Cotswold District Council 01285 623000,<br>
Gloucestershire Highways 0800 0 514 514<br>
or the Parish Clerk 01285 644864.
</p>
    <font size="4"><b>HIGH STREET CROSSING – GLOUCESTERSHIRE HIGHWAYS</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">The Parish Council has received a report from GCC stating that the case for the provision of a pedestrian crossing is not justified. This will become an agenda item at the next Council Meeting on Wednesday 14th March.</p>

    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>SEWERAGE WORKS</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">Confirmation that the upgrading of the sewerage system will not commence until 5th March at the earliest has been received from Thames Water. The work will be completed by mid-August.</p>

    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>CANDIDATES WANTED FOR OUR PARISH COUNCIL ELECTIONS IN MAY</b></font></p>
