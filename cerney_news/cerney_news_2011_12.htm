<p align="left"><b>PRECEPT MEETING</b> </p>
All residents are invited to attend a public meeting on <b>Wednesday 7th December at 7.30 pm</b> in the Village Hall. The meeting is to explain how the Parish Council makes its financial plans for the coming fiscal year starting April 2012. It will be explained how a grant from the Parish Council could help aspirations of local groups which have the best interests of the Parish of South Cerney with Cerney Wick in mind. Parish Councillors will gauge the feelings of villagers if there should there be a need to increase the amount collected in Council Tax which is currently £45.32 a year for a Band D dwelling.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>LAKE 31</b> </p>

At its recent meeting the Parish Council unanimously agreed to the following proposal: that the Parish Council deplores the decisions made by Cotswold District Council not to take enforcement action against the Watermark Group over the breach in planning regulations concerning the excessive infilling at Lake 31.

<p align="left"><b>UPPER-UP TREE PLANTING</b> </p>

What better way is there to commemorate someone or an event of significance in your life than by having a tree planted with a plaque or a park seat installed on the Upper Up recreation field? Over the past few years trees have been planted by the Parish Council on the Upper Up playing field paid for by those who wish to have a lasting memorial for a loved one or maybe to celebrate a special occasion such as the birth of a child. The Parish Council is committed to maintain these trees so that they can grow and become a feature of the landscape. If you would like to have a tree planted please contact <b>Cllr James Harris </b> on <b>01285 861812</b>
</p>

<p align="left"><b>OVERGROWING HEDGES</b> </p>

Every year this perennial problem persists. The Parish Council does not wish to be over zealous in its 
    insistence that residents who let their hedges inconvenience other members of the parish, including those in Cerney Wick, should take responsibility and cut them back. It is a last resort in writing to individuals who do not conform to show consideration in this property husbandry. Consequently could all residents who have hedges overgrowing public footpaths please make an effort and cut them back?
</p>


<p align="left"><b>CHANGES TO THE BUS SERVICE</b> </p>

A reduction to the bus service has recently been introduced. On Sundays Route 51A Cirencester to Swindon has been withdrawn. Route 861 which operated on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from Kempsford to Cirencester has ceased.
