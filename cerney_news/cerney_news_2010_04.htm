    <p align="left"><b>DOG MESS</b> </p>

    <p align="left">Complaints continue to be received about the amount of dog litter which is being left in public places by the anti-social people who fail to clean up after their pets. If caught, those guilty should be aware that the Cotswold Community Wardens will be taking steps to prosecute them. The problem is more acute in the vicinity of Beverstone Road and Gypsy Lane area. The majority of pet owners do clean up after their dogs.
