<p align="left"><b>REFRESHING AND REVIEWING THE VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>


Following the well attended meeting held in the Village Hall on 6th October to obtain the views of residents, their comments and opinions, the Parish Council and members of the community are currently reviewing the 2004 parish plan and refreshing the actions so that a new plan can be created that best reflects the needs of the parish now, in 2010. If you couldn't be there don't worry as there is still time to make a contribution!
If you want change to happen; if you want things to stay the same; if you want to see new facilities built, or old ones protected; if you have projects you would like to see take place, let us know by writing to the South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Clerk, 6 North Home Road, Cirencester GL7 1DP or emailing him at 
    <a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk">clerk@southcerney.org.uk</a>
Remember a parish plan is a community owned document. The reviewed and refreshed South Cerney with Cerney Wick parish plan will set out community activity in the parish for the next five years - so this is your chance to have your say.
