<p align="left"><b>DIAMOND JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS</b> </p>

Cllr Jay reported that the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee celebrations which had been sponsored by the Parish Council could be considered an outstanding success. In its precept the Parish Council had allocated £2,500 to the event. Cllr Jay and the group of which he was Finance Chairman and Coordinator had sold 46 tables at £10 each and 97 mugs at £5. Two tables had been provided for guests from the Duke of Gloucester Barracks. There was a refund of £3.42 for one broken mug. Altogether income amounted to £3,448.42. Expenses totalled £2,298.86 which provided a surplus of £1,149.56. The total cost of the precept therefore was £1,350.44 which was considered money well spent. Two hundred and forty four mugs were presented to the children of Ann Edwards Church of England Primary School and a further 6 were taken to India by Revd. David Bowers. Due to the inclement weather the tables were moved to the marquee and Cllr Jay estimated that there were about 450 people catered for there.
