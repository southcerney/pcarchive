    <font size="4"><b>Upgraded sewer system for village</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">At long last we can look forward to our antiquated sewer system being renewed. After too many broken pipes with the associated mess on our roads, Thames Water, in conjunction with Halcrow have now finalised the plans for a brand new rising main to take the sewage from Robert Franklin Way to Shorncote. Details of the scheme were exhibited at the Village Hall on the 13th December when excellent plans and aerial photographs made the scheme easy to understand.

</p>
    <p align="left">Thames Water and their Associates have liaised fully with the Parish Council and other interested parties over the planned route and have made several alterations to their original plans to accommodate various unexpected needs and overcome technical difficulties.

</p>
    <p align="left">The works planned to start early in the New Year will take an estimated 36 weeks to complete. The line of the new pumping main will mean the absolute minimum of disruption for most of the village. The pipe will go alongside Kingfisher Place continuing past Lake 16 to the industrial estate, adjacent to Gypsy Lane, into the field beyond the school, onto Upper Up playing fields, under the Ashton Keynes road into Shorncote/Thames 
    Water site to connect to the sewage works. A second smaller pipe will run 
    from Berkeley Close and join the main construction at the industrial estate. </p>
    <p align="left">Naturally there will be some disruption but to have a brand 
    new system will surely make it all worthwhile.</p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><b>How about a New Year Resolution??</b></font></p>
    <p align="left">In May 2007 the current 4 year term of the Parish Council ends and we invite applicants for the posts of Parish Councillors. If we get more than 11 applicants, which would be ideal, we would have an election. Several of the present council members are willing to stand again so there will be continuity of experience etc. Why not ring Mike Stuart 860439 or Maurice McKee 644864 to find out more about this way of helping your village?</p>
