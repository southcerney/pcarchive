<p align="left"><b>REFRESHING AND REVIEWING THE VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>


As our current Village Plan is in need of an update a meeting has been arranged for Wednesday 6th October at 7.30 pm in the Village Hall to discuss, with all interested parties or individuals, how they would like see the community develop in the next few years. This is an opportunity for you to influence the direction and future of village schemes and dreams.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>PRECEPT CONSIDERATIONS</b> </p>

<p align="left">The Parish Council will decide its spending options early in January 2011 for the next year, i.e. from April 2011 through until March 2012. If there is any group in the village which would like to put in a bid for finance, now is the time to contact a Parish Councillor and make a case for funding. The Parish Council cannot make grants to individuals.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>GET YOUR WAY</b> </p>

<p align="left">The Parish Council would like to thank everyone who did such fine work in making the day's fun such a success. As a consequence other spin off events have been organised including two parties, because of the demand, of youths who will visit the ski slope in Gloucester, Another exciting plan is to have a sleep over supervised by the Cotswold Forest School. If you have not already joined in. the fun please contact either Mary Mychaleckyj from the Gloucestershire Youth and Community Service or our own Youth Worker, Emily Hallet.
