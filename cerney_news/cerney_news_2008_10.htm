    <font size="4"><b>WOW, WHAT A SUCCESS<br>
    </b></font>Well done to children and parents alike. Wednesday 10th September saw the start of a new initiative to encourage children at Ann Edwards School to walk to school ...Walk On Wednesdays. Failing that, if they need to be driven to school because they live further away, they are encouraged to "Park and Stride". That is to say, to park further away from school and to walk from somewhere within the village. Unfortunately, children arriving by bus will not be able to participate as they have to be delivered to the school gates.<p align="left">This scheme was the idea of Parish Councillor Peter Jay, and at the end of the year the class with the greatest number of children who have "walked in on Wednesdays" will be going on an extra fun/educational trip subsidised by the Parish Council. Cyclists will be counted in too, but COW didn't sound so good!<p align="left">For the inaugural day there were six Parish Councillors to witness the response and I am glad to say there was a really big reduction in the number of cars in the parking areas. We were very pleased to see how well the children and their parents had responded to the challenge. Here's hoping that you can all keep it up right through the year come rain or shine. Very well done to you all.
    <p>
    <font size="4"><b>CYCLING ON FOOTPATHS<br>
    </b></font>Once again inconsiderate cyclists must be reminded that the public footpaths throughout the village are for the exclusive use of pedestrians. Cyclists should not ride their bikes on these paths particularly where signs prohibit the activity. 
    <u>It is dangerous to do so but more especially where a property's front door opens on to the pathway.</u> Residents are still reporting ignorant disregard of this request..
