      <P align="left"><B>R-WAY SUCCESS STORY</B> </P>After a recruitment drive at the Street Fair many more youngsters were encouraged and attended the meeting at Scout Headquarters in Berkeley Close. R-Way continues to go from strength to strength with two members of the team currently attending courses on the provision of youth participation activities in Gloucester. Jasmine Tresadern and Chris Wearing are nearing the end of their course and when they finish will be qualified Youth Leaders able to help out the existing Youth Leaders, Emily Hallett and Jai Cunningham in youth activities in the village. The Parish Council would sincerely like to thank Cotswold District Council for financially subsidising this exercise.
      <P></P>
      <P align="left"><B>STREET FAIR</B> </P>The Parish Council wishes to congratulate all those, especially the Street Fair organising committee, who did much sterling work in making the weekend such an outstanding success. Well done to all those involved.

      <P align="left"><B>OVERGROWING HEDGES</B>
      </P>It is that time of year again when the growth of shrubs and hedges flourish. Some residents allow such excess to interfere with users of public footpaths and every year we have to write to several residents to cut back their offending plants. To prevent this nuisance to all, can those with hedges please cut them back. Thank you in anticipation.
