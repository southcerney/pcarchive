    <b>DIGITAL TV RECEPTION - SWITCHOVER IN THE SOUTH CERNEY AREA</b><p align="left">

  Peter Watson from DIGITALUK gave a presentation to Parish Councillors prior to their monthly meeting, on the forthcoming switchover from analogue to digital television reception in our local area. Every TV you want to carry on watching will have to be connected with a digital box, or upgraded to a new TV with a digital box inside. This means also that if you want to watch one programme whilst recording another, you will need a digital TV recorder. Those households receiving their signal from the Mendip transmitter or any of its relay stations (that is those receiving BBC West local news), the switchover will be on 24 March 2010. Furthermore, the analogue signal will be switched off altogether on 7 April 2010, and the digital signal will be considerably boosted. On the other hand, those households receiving their signal from the Oxford or Ridge Hill transmitters will not be switching over until 2011. If you have any immediate questions, visit the website at www.digitaluk.co.uk. Alternatively, you can phone the Advice Line on 08456 50 50 50 (open 9am - 7pm Monday to Friday and 10 am - 4 pm on a Saturday). Peter Watson has kindly agreed to give a further presentation in the Village Hall during January. It is planned to take place from 2pm-6pm although the exact day has not yet been finalised. Keep a lookout for information on the notice boards and the next issue of Cerney News.

    <b>RED TELEPHONE BOXES</b>
    <p align="left">

At its recent meeting the Parish Council voted unanimously to reject the offer to adopt the red telephone boxes in South Cerney and Cerney Wick on the grounds that if they had agreed then BT would have removed the telephone apparatus thus depriving residents of the communications. It is understood that the kiosks will now remain in service.</td>
