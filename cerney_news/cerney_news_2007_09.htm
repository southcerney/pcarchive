    <font size="4"><b>LIGHTING CONSULTATION<br>
    </b></font>Gloucestershire County Council has a scheme to switch off alternate
street lights in villages across the county between midnight and 5.30am
(GMT), to save money on electricity, and also reduce CO2 emissions
and light pollution. The Parish Council is in favour of this, but before
progressing the scheme it would very much like to hear of any specific
concerns residents may have. A detailed plan showing precisely which
lights are to be affected will be available for inspection in the Village
Hall on Thursday, 4th October between 4pm and 6pm. A representative
from GCC Street Lighting department will also attend.</p>
    <font size="4"><b>CYCLING ON FOOTPATHS<br>
    </b></font>A complaint has been received about cyclists using the footpaths in the
village. Besides being dangerous and against the law, it shows the total
disregard by those guilty, for the rights of pedestrians using the
footpath. It is particularly hazardous for those residents exiting their
properties onto a footpath and being confronted by a cyclist.

    </b></font>Scottish and Southern Energy are planning to install a new high voltage
cable between Cricklade and the Spine Road along the route of the old
railway line. The company is aware that a certain amount of disruption
is unavoidable but will do its utmost to keep this to a minimum and
would be grateful for your understanding and co-operation whilst works
are ongoing. The work is scheduled to commence on or about 17th
September and the programme is expected to take approximately 12
weeks. Every effort will be made to adhere to this timetable although
site conditions may force adjustments. Further information can be
obtained from Richard Bishop on 07767 850216.
