      <P align="left"><B>FLOODING</B> </P>
      Further immediate action to relieve potential flooding to Box
	  Bush, Robert Franklin Way and The Lennards was decided
	  on by the Parish Council at its meeting on 12th February. The
	  flood relief works carried out in 2012/13 had kept the river
	  Churn below danger level but with the continuous rainfall
	  and close monitoring of the Environment Agency information
	  it was clear that another slipway had to be created if disaster
	  was to be averted. All the relevant agreements from the
	  agencies concerned were obtained and James Harris with a
	  group of volunteers completed the task on Thursday 13th
	  February. Thames Water has prepared a questionnaire for
	  those of you whose properties have been adversely affected
	  by the conditions. It is very important that these forms are
	  completed and returned as they will be used to determine
which parts of the village need to be protected in future.

      <P align="left"><B>WAR MEMORIAL</B></P>
      Work will start shortly on dismantling of the monument and
	  removal of the surrounding posts and chains of the War
	  Memorial at the junction of Broadway Lane and High Street.
	  The health and safety paperwork issues have been approved
	  and the company hope to start work on Monday 24th
	  February. Centreline Architectural Sculpture will refurbish
	  the memorial and store it until the highway alterations which
	  are scheduled to begin in early March have been completed
	  at the junction. It is anticipated that the work on the
carriageway will take approximately four weeks to complete.

      <P align="left"><B>WORLD WAR I COMMEMORATIONS</B> </P>
      The Parish Council appeals for the loan of any memorabilia
	  or photographs relating to the 1914–1918 World War. If you
	  are willing to lend them to the Parish Council for display
please contact Cllr Peter Jay on 860641.

      <P align="left"><B>A417 MISSING LINK</B></P>
      The Parish Council unanimously supports Gloucestershire
	  County Council in its campaign to secure funding to sort out
	  the A417 “missing link”. The link is a 5km stretch of single
	  carriageway on the A417 with the remaining route being a
	  dual carriageway between the M4 at Swindon and M5 at
	  Gloucester. The scheme, if it is added to the government’s
	  list, will stand a much greater chance of securing funding
	  when cash is allocated in spring 2015. The new road will be
	  made up of a short bypass of Nettleton Bottom, widening of
	  Birdlip Bypass, a new junction at Birdlip, a new junction
	  replacing the Air Balloon roundabout and construction of an
	  additional two lane carriageway down Crickley Hill. The
	  result will be an uninterrupted dual carriageway all the way
	  from the M5 at Gloucester to the M4 at Swindon. The Parish
	  Council encourages everyone to show your support by
	  signing up and pledge your backing on  <a href="http://www.a417missinglink.co.uk" target="_blank">

      <P align="left"><B>UPPER UP COMPOST SITE</B></P>
Reluctantly the Parish Council agreed that it must close its
composting site to any new deposits at Upper Up until the
present wet conditions relent. It has become impossible to
manage the material. As soon as conditions improve the site
will be opened up again to receive material for composting.
Thank you for your understanding in these difficult times.
