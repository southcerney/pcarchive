<p align="left"><b>FLOODING AND DRAINAGE EMERGENCY</b> </p>

Although South Cerney was far more fortunate than some other communities during the recent deluge, several people were badly affected by the high water levels and by the sewer pipes not being able to cope with the excess of storm water. The Parish Council, working closely with our elected representatives on 
    both Cotswold District and Gloucestershire County Councils, were able to prevent even worse flooding in the Robert Franklin Way and Box Bush areas by carrying out extensive excavation works to release the backed up flood waters behind the old railway line embankment. Several members of the Parish Council were actively involved in the digging following the unanimous vote by all members to proceed. Approval was obtained from GCC and the Environment Agency. Particular thanks must be given to Cllr James Harris who put our Rapid Reaction Flood Relief Plan into operation doing all the mechanical work and also supervising all the volunteers from the neighbourhood who helped. This was a marvellous example of community spirit.</p>
<p align="left">The reinstatement of the drainage spillway will have to be undertaken by higher agencies and negotiations are underway regarding responsibility for design, building and financing the works. Our MP, Mr Clifton-Brown, has inspected the site and has promised to ensure that we get the correct solution as soon as possible. He is planning a series of public meetings in the Village Hall where we can discuss the problems. These will probably commence in mid-March.</p>
<p allign="left">To re-open the footpath on the railway line, GCC erected a temporary footbridge which will stay until the main works are completed.</p>
<p allign="left">The drainage and sewerage problems are also subject to consideration. 
The Parish Council has carried out a survey of all dwellings affected by both flood risk and sewer problems to ascertain exactly what happened throughout the village. Thames Water says that it could not do anything during the height of the flooding but have implied that they will be carrying out detailed inspections of suspect pipelines in the near future.

<p align="left"><b>GCC FLOOD FUND</b> </p>

Anyone who was flooded may be able to apply to Gloucestershire County Council for financial assistance as the deadline previously set for such applications has been removed. However, there is a very limited budget and once that has been exhausted there will be no more. For details 01452 654834 or 654836 or by e-mail <a href="mailto:claire.waters@edf-energy.com">Claire Waters</a> or <a href="mailto:gail.mattocks@edf-energy.com">Gail Mattocks</a>.

<p align="left"><b>ALTERATION TO THE ROAD JUNCTION BY THE WAR MEMORIAL</b> </p>

The Parish Council voted unanimously to proceed with the next stage of having the War Memorial moved a very short distance to permit the alteration of the present triangle junction to a T-junction at the meeting of Broadway Lane and High Street. This will mean taking into account requests made by local people, including near neighbours, to ensure that the very best scheme will be prepared. Those plans will then be available for all to inspect.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>LORRIES</b> </p>

Recently, many people complained to the Parish Council about the movement of a group of heavy lorries hauling soil through the centre of the village. It was suggested that they were contravening the weight limit which covers the village and that an unacceptable amount of mud was being deposited on the highways. Advice was sought from the Gloucestershire Constabulary and the contractor was stopped from using the short cut and at the same time a road sweeping machine arrived to clean the roads.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>HAM LANE FOOTPATH</b> </p>

As this lane is not currently a Public Right of Way the Parish Council has agreed to apply to the County Council to have it adopted as one to protect its continued use. The Parish Council has used its best endeavours to establish if anyone actually owns the land over which it runs but it appears that no one does. It will take some time before the legal processes have been completed.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>COUNCIL TAX PRECEPT</b> </p>

For the Tax Year 2013-14 the Parish Council has lowered its precept while still being able to support several organisations and projects in the parish. For a Band D dwelling the annual total payable for Parish Council will be £45.18p, a reduction of 14p per annum. Full details of the budget can be seen on our web site www.southcerney.org.uk.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>TRAINING OUR FUTURE YOUTH WORKERS</b> </p>

As part of its commitment to maintain a Youth Service in our community, the Parish Council has obtained funding from the CDC to pay for two of our senior members of the R-Way youth team to train as qualified Youth Workers. Cllr Chris Wearing and his colleague Jasmine Tresadern are travelling to Gloucester every week to attend training sessions.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH</b> </p>

South Cerney has many roads taking part in the Neighbourhood Watch scheme and recently most dwellings had packs of information about the scheme delivered to them. However, it seems that many people did not appreciate that to be members it is necessary to contact our coordinators to register one's details. Your coordinator's details are shown on the first sheet on the pack headed "For Homes that are Safe as Houses". Please do register as this is an excellent scheme.
