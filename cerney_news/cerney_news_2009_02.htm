    <font size="4"><b> NEW PARISH COUNCILLOR<br>
    </b></font>From the six applicants the Parish Council decided on its first ballot to
!co-opt John-Charles Kimberley on to the council. The Parish Council
would like to sincerely thank the other five candidates for their interest
and sense of duty in wishing to become a councillor. Mr Kimberley
known as Johno, will continue as a councillor until the next election,
provisionally to be held in May 2011.

    <font size="4"><b>PRECEPT DECISION<br>
    </b></font>The Parish Council accepted the recommendations of its Precept Committee which had prepared a budget for the coming financial year, i.e. from April 2009 until March 2010. The budget can be viewed on the Parish Council's web site www.southcerney.org.uk. The total planned expenditure for the coming year is £1,020 less than this year's and could have been more if interest rates had not fallen so precipitously thereby reducing the return on invested capital. The increase on a band "D" property is a modest 19p per annum. Cllr Jay, Chairman of the Finance Committee stated that the commitment to Village Plan projects was secured although overall the budget could be classed as neutral. The Parish Council would like to reassure residents that none of its investments were affected by the recent collapse of any financial institution.<p>
