    At its meeting in November the Parish Council drew up a “wish list” of 
    projects it would like to proceed with over the next four years. In no 
    particular order of preference the list included: Speed activated warning 
    signs at the village gateways; one or more zebra crossing(s); a skateboard 
    ramp; a football kick back wall; youth shelters; a pop-in facility which 
    could include a cyber café; subsidised evening bus service to Cirencester; 
    raised flower beds on communal grass verges; street furniture of a uniform 
    design; rubbish bins alongside all public seating; additional staging for 
    the Village Hall; new seats for the Village Hall. The Finance Committee will 
    meet in early January to prioritise the list and decide on its 
    recommendations which will be decided at a meeting of the Parish Council on 
    14 January 2004.<br>

    <font size="4">PARKING</font><br>
    Once again some motorists are using communal grass verges in parts of the 
    village to park their cars. Besides being anti-social, damage is being 
    caused to the grass areas and the bulbs which have been planted there. These 
    motorists are urged to find alternative parking places preferably on the 
    highway and not to further damage a fragile village amenity.</strong></p>
