      <P align="left"><B>EMERGENCY PLAN</B> </P>Parish Council has several volunteers from the community
willing to help set up an Emergency Plan for the parish. Using
advice from County Council, District Council and from
Gloucestershire Rural Community Council, the group is
preparing a draft plan designed to deal with every type of
emergency, not only flooding, that could possibly affect us.
The aim is then to role out the scheme involving as many of
the organisations, clubs and individuals to ensure that everyone
is aware of what to do should any emergency hits us. </p>

      <P align="left"><B>FLOOD ALLEVIATION WORKS</B>
      </P>Cotswold District Council, working with Glos Highways, has
recently carried out essential improvements to a collapsed
drain on the outskirts of the village at Upper Up. During the
floods of last winter, and in previous years, water from the
roadside ditch was unable to access the main drain and flooded
the roadway. After initial exploratory works carried out by
local volunteers who found that the drain was blocked the
authorities have now renewed the pipes.

      <P align="left"><B>SEASON'S GREETINGS</B> </P>The Chairman, Vice Chairman, Parish Councillors and Clerk
wish the residents of South Cerney and Cerney Wick a very
happy Christmas and best wishes for the New Year.

      <P align="left"><B>BE PREPARED FOR FLOODING</B> </P>If you live anywhere that is likely to be flooded please ensure
that you have obtained your own supply of sand bags and have
taken all possible steps to protect your property and
possessions. Such supplies will not be available from Parish
Council.

      <P align="left"><B>VILLAGE PLAN</B></P>The new Village Plan has been formally adopted by Parish
Council which will use it as their mandate for the next few
years. To see the new Plan go to www.southcerney.org.uk. We
also intend to include the details of the Plan in the next edition
of the Cerney News.

      <P align="left"><B>CERNEY WICK PLAYGROUND</B> </P>After some excellent fund raising by the people of Cerney
Wick and obtaining some large grants from various sources the
playground is being totally renewed. Work should be finalised
by the beginning of February, depending on weather
conditions, but until then the facility has to be kept closed.

      <P align="left"><B>R-WAY YOUTH GROUP</B>
      </P>After completing their intensive training course in Youth
Leadership, financed by CDC, Jasmin Tresadern and Chris
Wearing are now assistant leaders for the R-Way Youth Group
here in Cerney. They recently received their certificates from
our District Councillors. The group meets on Monday
evenings at the Scout building in Berkeley Close with the
