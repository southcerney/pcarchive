    <p align="left"><b>PRECEPT DECISION</b> <br>
The Parish Council accepted the recommendation of its Finance Committee regarding the precept for the forthcoming financial year, i.e. from April 2010 until March 2011. The budget details can be viewed on the Parish Council's web site 
    <a href="http://www.southcerney.org.uk/" style="text-decoration: none">www.southcerney.org.uk</a>. The total planned expenditure for the coming year is £125 less than this current year's and could have been further reduced if interest rates had not fallen so precipitously thereby reducing the return on invested capital. However, due to the apparent decrease in dwellings paying Council Tax in our Parish, the actual annual payment on a band "D" property will in fact increase but only by a modest 5p per annum. </p>

<p align="left"><b>PUBLIC MEETING</b> <br>
The Public Meeting, which had been scheduled for March 5th to consider if the "The Cotswold Water Park Society is fit for purpose", has been postponed to a date and venue yet to be agreed. Due to the serious implications of this motion, it is considered to be essential that someone with a certain degree of authority should be in charge of the proceedings. A request has been made to our MP Mr Geoffrey Clifton-Brown that he should accept the role and his reply is awaited. For those so far not closely involved with the issues surrounding the Society it is perhaps worthwhile to explain why it is felt necessary to call such a public meeting. The Society plays a valued role in the Water Park and it is essential that it succeeds despite the financial problems that are currently besetting it. An explanation from those responsible for the Society on how they intend to correct the current issues so that this valued local institution can move forward is sought.</p>

    <p align="left"><b>ALLOTMENTS AT UPPER UP</b> <br>
The second meeting of the newly formed group of allotment holders at Upper Up was held on 12th February at the Village Hall. The group decided to call itself "The Digger Uppers Group". Volunteers have formed a committee and planning approval for change of use of the land is being applied for. Several of the members only want part of a full plot and are prepared to share. Consequently there could be some spare land available for those who may have an interest but have so far not been involved. Details of the scheme and a link to the Allotments Forum can be found on the Parish Council web site
