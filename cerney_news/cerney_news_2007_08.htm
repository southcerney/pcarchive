    <font size="4"><b>CONTENTS OF WHEELIE BINS<br>
    </b></font>Mike Harris, Waste Communications Officer at CDC has asked the Parish Council to remind residents not to put plastic bags in their green garden waste wheelie bins. There have been several recent instances of lorry loads being heavily ‘contaminated’ with plastic bin bags on delivery to the Agricultural Supply Company (ASC) at Sunhill where the material is turned into a soil improver for local farmers. If the contamination continues there is a real risk that entire loads will not be accepted by ASC and will therefore have to be sent to landfill sites instead. Garden waste should be put loose into the bins, not in bags.</p>
    <font size="4"><b>TEMPORARY ROAD CLOSURE<br>
    </b></font>The Parish Council has been notified of the temporary closure of road number 3/179 Ewen Road, South Cerney for work to construct a culvert across the carriageway outside Hills Minerals Quarry for a distance of 50 metres. The road will be closed from 6am on Thursday 6th September until midnight on Sunday 9th September or until the work is completed, whichever is earlier.

    <font size="4"><b>COMPLAINTS OF EXCESSIVE NOISE AT ROBERT FRANKLIN WAY PLAY AREA AFTER THE CURFEW PERIOD<br>
    </b></font>The Parish Council requests that users of the play area at Robert Franklin Way observe the very reasonable restriction that the space is vacated after 10pm in the evening. This petition is aimed especially at those parents whose off-spring inconsiderately use the facility after curfew time and disturb the peace of residents living nearby. Would all parents please ensure that their children take notice of the Parish Council’s appeal?

    <font size="4"><b>NEW RECYCLING FACILITY AT UPPER UP<br>
    </b></font>CDC has installed a facility for the collection of cardboard, to be recycled, on the Upper Up car park.
