<p align="left"><b>NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR'S COUNCIL TAX PRECEPT</b> </p>

    The Parish Council has accepted the recommendation of its Finance Committee regarding the precept for the forthcoming financial year, April 2011 to March 2012. The budget details can be viewed on the Parish Council's web site www.southcerney.org.uk. Despite the greatly reduced interest income received on our capital reserves, the total planned expenditure for the coming year will be £810 less than the current year's. Due to unforeseen problems with not having various projects completed, we have an under-spend in this year's budget with some £2,000 of that money carried over to next year. Also, aided by an increase in dwellings paying Council Tax in our Parish, the actual annual payment for a band "D" property will decrease by £1.37 per annum. Despite the recession, the Parish Council is able to budget for the decrease in their share of the Council Tax precept whilst at the same time supporting several community groups which come under the Village Plan Budget. The need to maintain the Youth Group, including the employment of a qualified Youth Leader, is supported by £8,000 while other groups which will benefit are: Scouts (improvements to building) £1,000; South Cerney Youth Football £500; Play Group £500; United Church (for their work with the elderly in the community) £300; South Cerney 
    Stragglers (the recently formed running club) £500. The District Tree Warden 
    scheme will receive £100 which will be taken from the Training Budget.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DOG MESS</b> </p>

There are still inconsiderate dog owners refusing to pick up their pets' mess on pavements and footpaths. It was especially evident after the last bout of snowy weather, particularly when the thaw arrived. There is just no excuse for this behaviour and the CDC Wardens are working in the village to take action against offenders. Already one anti social person has received a letter warning that they must clean up after their dog. Remember the maximum fine for such an offence is £1,000.

<p align="left"><b>NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE PANEL MEETING</b> </p>

The meeting held on 11th January was well attended by people from several villages including ours, who were informed of the way in which the police will be reorganised in the near future. PC Andy Burfoot will be spending more time in our village as his current beat has been greatly reduced. PCSO Michael Owen will remain in this patch but PCSO Vickie Beale is being moved to Cirencester. It was good to hear that the number of reported crime incidents is extremely low in our parish but the police did warn about a marked increase in burglaries throughout the county and recommended that we all take precautions such as ensuring that all windows and doors including sheds, are locked and ladders chained and padlocked. To help counter the risk of burglaries, the police have increased patrols around the area but do ask that we all report anything suspicious to them by ringing 0845 0901234 no matter how small it may seem. They do rely on our help.

<p align="left"><b>FOOTPATH LIGHTING</b> </p>

After many months since the poles were erected in the footpath between Station Road and Box Bush, without the lights being added, we have been informed that these will be installed in the first couple of weeks in April. The footpaths concerned will be closed for the duration of the work.
