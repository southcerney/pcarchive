<p align="left"><b>ALTERATION TO THE ROAD JUNCTION BY THE WAR MEMORIAL</b> </p>

Following consultation with neighbours, interested groups and organisations in the village, the Preliminary Plans showing the suggested repositioning of the War Memorial a small distance to permit changes to the road junction of Broadway Lane with High Street, have been returned to the designers. Now they will prepare definite plans taking into account the requests for modifications as requested by interested people. It is intended to display the revised plans so do keep watch for notices saying where these can be seen.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>DEFIBRILLATOR INSTRUCTION</b> </p>

Many people have asked how the new portable emergency defibrillator recently installed outside the Laurels Pharmacy works. In fact, the unit has a built in fail safe instruction system which makes it extremely easy for anyone to use. However, there is to be a training event in the Village Hall on Wednesday 6th March starting at 7.15 pm when everyone is invited to attend.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>REVISED VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>

As most of the objectives included in the last Village Plan carried out some six years ago have been achieved, the Parish Council working with Gloucestershire Rural Communities Council is preparing a draft for a new plan. It is intended that the framework for the new plan will be on display at the Street Fair where everyone will be asked to make comments and suggest additions as they think fit. If you have any suggestions prior to then, please send them to our Parish Clerk, Maurice McKee, 6 North Home Road, Cirencester GL7 1DP or email <a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk"> clerk@southcerney.org.uk</a>
</p>

<p align="left"><b>FLOOD RESILIENCE MEETING</b> </p>

Working towards achieving improvements to the flood defences and repairing any faults in the sewers of our village, our MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown is holding an Open Meeting in the Hall on Friday 14th March starting at 2 pm. He has invited officers from Thames Water, the Environment Agency, Bromford Housing and other agencies to be present to give reports on their plans to improve their services. Members of the public are invited to attend.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>MODIFICATIONS TO THE EMERGENCY FLOOD RELIEF CHANNEL</b> </p>

Gloucestershire Highways owns the old railway track through which the Parish Council dug a flood relief channel during the flood emergency last Christmas. As the risk of further flooding appears to have receded and as the Highways team need vehicular access to repair the large brick bridge at Bow Wow, it is about to place some large diameter pipes in the trench and back fill. It has yet to be decided if Gloucestershire Highways will reopen the trench after the bridge repair works are completed.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>A419 NAG (NOISE ACTION GROUP)</b> </p>

The organisers have created a new website for the campaign to reduce noise on the A419 at
    <a target="_blank" href="http://a419nag.co.uk/">http://a419nag.co.uk/</a> The next step for the group will be to ask people to complete the survey on the website so that it can be ascertained how many of you are impacted by the road noise. This information will be used to lobby the Highways Agency to take action. Please complete the survey, as your ongoing feedback will be very important to the group going forward.
</p>


<p align="left"><b>PUBLIC SEAT AT KINGFISHER PLACE</b> </p>

In a response to a request from a resident the Parish Council would like to find out from residents if there is general support for it to install a public seat in the vicinity of the bus shelter at Kingfisher Place.
Please send your opinion to our Parish Clerk, Maurice McKee, 6 North Home Road, Cirencester GL7 1DP or email <a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk"> clerk@southcerney.org.uk</a>
