    Lt Col S. English, Commanding Officer 29 Regt Duke of Gloucester Barracks 
    has agreed to attend a meeting of Parish Councillors prior to a Parish 
    Council meeting on 11 February. The Parish Council would welcome members of 
    the public to attend this meeting which will start at 7pm in the Committee 
    Room of the Village Hall in School Lane. The meeting is scheduled to last 30 
    minutes starting with a short presentation by Lt Col English followed by a 
    question and answer session from Parish Councillors and members of the 
    public.<br>

    <font size="4">INCONSIDERATE PARKING<br>
    THROUGHOUT SOUTH CERNEY</font><br>
    Complaints are being received with increasing regularity about vehicles 
    which are parked on pavements and inconsiderately throughout residential 
    areas in the village. Besides it being a nuisance to residents of the 
    streets affected there is a fear that such behaviour will hamper access to 
    emergency vehicles. Motorists who park their vehicles anywhere are reminded 
    to behave responsibly. It just might be that the fire engine or ambulance on 
    a critical mission could be delayed because of where you have parked.</b></p>
