      <P align="left"><B>ANTISOCIAL PARKING</B> </P>Those who park on pavements are causing a nuisance to pedestrians, especially
those in wheelchairs or with prams. All such incidents should be reported by
telephoning 101 quoting the vehicle registration, location and time of offence.
Likewise if anyone is seen illegally interfering with property of any kind or
suspected of such action, the person/s should be reported to the police
emergency 999 giving as much relevant detail as possible.
      <P></P>

      <P align="left"><B>PARISH PRECEPT</B> </P>A public meeting is being planned for November to explain how the Parish
Council makes its financial plans for the coming fiscal year starting April 2014.
It will be shown how a grant from the Parish Council could help the aspirations
of local groups which have the best interests of the Parish of South Cerney with
Cerney Wick in mind. Parish Councillors will gauge the feelings of villagers if
there should be a need to increase the amount collected in Council Tax which is
currently £45.18 a year for a Band D dwelling. If a club or recognised grouping
is intent on making a bid for a grant it is vitally important that a representative
is present at the meeting. Be advised that failure to attend the meeting may
exclude any bid for a grant..

      <P align="left"><B>ROAD CLOSURE</B>
      </P>Gloucestershire Highways has announced that the Ashton Keynes to Siddington
road will be closed from 23rd September–25th October 2013 for bridge repairs
to be carried out.

      <P align="left"><B>DRAFT PARISH PLAN</B> </P>The draft Parish Plan has been published on the web site and comments are
invited. The plan will be an agenda item for the 11th September meeting of the
Parish Council.

      <P align="left"><B>SOUTH CERNEY COMMUNITY COMPOSTING SCHEME</B> </P>This ever growing project is open to everyone in the village to bring their green
waste which will then be converted into useful compost. Financed by the Parish
Council and sponsored by Gloucestershire County Council (GCC) this scheme
has the potential to earn money which can be used for other projects in our
community.<br>
      There is no charge for bringing your green waste and the majority of the work
involved in making the compost comes from local volunteers and some
professional help. Anyone is welcome to come along and help, either as a one
off or on a regular basis. For more information as to how you can help, call
Mike Stuart on 860439.<br>
      When the material is fully composted we can claim money from GCC. We then
have the compost to dispose of. Those who have helped in the making of the
compost will get first call on having it for their gardens. Thereafter we will be
able to offer any remaining compost to others at a realistic price which will be
notified when the next batch is ready towards the end of the summer.<br>
      There is a limit as to what we can use in the composting procedure. Please do
respect our request and bring only stuff we can use as listed below. It will also
be appreciated if you can read the instructions at the Upper Up site and then
leave your green waste in the reception spaces as indicated.<br>
