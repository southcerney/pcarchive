Everyone can benefit from properly fitted and maintained smoke alarms. They can give you valuable seconds in which to escape from a fire at home. 
They can literally mean the difference between life and death. If you would like smoke alarms fitted in your home but you cannot do the work yourself, 
a free service exists which will install them for you. Please call 0800 180 41 40 to arrange your FREE Home Fire Safety Check. 
Our staff will also install FREE smoke alarms where necessary. If you don't think you require this service consider if you know anyone who would. 
Let them know about this important service particularly if they have anyone in their homes who are very young or elderly.<p align="left">
