<p align="left"><b>A PUBLIC MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PRECEPT</b> </p>
All residents are invited to attend a public meeting on <b>Wednesday 7th December at 7.30 pm</b> in the Village Hall. The meeting is to explain how the Parish Council makes its financial plans for the coming fiscal year starting April 2012. It will be explained how a grant from the Parish Council could help aspirations of local groups which have the best interests of the Parish of South Cerney with Cerney Wick in mind. Parish Councillors will gauge the feelings of villagers should there be a need to increase the amount collected in Council Tax which is currently £45.32 a year for a Band D dwelling.

<p align="left"><b>FISH IN DISTRESS</b> </p>

Could residents please report sightings of fish in distress on the Environment Agency (EA) incident hotline number<b> 0800 80 70 60</b> so that officers can investigate? These reports are important because it not only gives the EA a chance to save the fish but is evidence of the need to reduce the demand for water in the area. It may be the case that the EA judge there are insufficient numbers of fish to justify a rescue because of the manpower required but it will do its utmost to respond. The levels on the Churn fluctuate and it can prove to be difficult to assess whether a rescue is required. There often appears to be no logic as to why the river has no water on one day and is flowing the next without appreciable rainfall. In September the EA performed a fish rescue in South Cerney and Cerney Wick - approximately 2,000 fish were moved downstream to the river Thames. On Wednesday 12th October it rescued a further 400 fish from the river Churn along School Lane, South Cerney.
