    Cllr Stuart and Cllr Squire met with Martyn Midgley, Gloucestershire
Highways Area Programme Manager on Wednesday 10th May.
Outstanding issues including the zebra crossing, interactive speed
limits, signing of the reduced speed limits on Silver Street to Preston
Toll Bar, moving the 30mph to its new agreed position and other
problems were discussed. Mr Midgley will make a comprehensive
report to the Parish Council before its next meeting when he has
further assessed the situation.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Youth Participation</font></b><br>
    The Gloucestershire Youth Service (with apologies to its title which I
am assured is about to be renamed) will be showing off its new mobile
unit specially designed to interact with the younger residents of South
Cerney over the mid-term school holiday. Mrs Helen Jones who
organises the service welcomes young people in the age range 11+ to
18 to come and participate and challenge the new facility. She has
promised to bring a range of activities such as rounders, a laptop
computer, leaflets, games and much more. Helen wants to hear your
views whether they be of a critical nature or otherwise. The unit will
be sited on the Upper Up car park on <b>Thursday 1st June from 2pm
until 4pm</b> or longer if required. Also, watch out for the arrival of the
mobile skateboard park. A suitable site for its erection is being
researched and I have been assured that the problem will be overcome.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Annual Meeting of the Parish Council</font></b><br>
    This was held on Wednesday 10th May at the Village Hall. There was
no change to the structure of the Parish Council. All members were
willing to remain in their various posts. The composition of the Parish
Council is currently displayed on the notice board in Clarks Hay,
opposite the Post Office.</p>
