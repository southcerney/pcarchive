    <font size="4"><b>YOUTH PARISH COUNCIL RECRUITS<br>
    </b>The Youth Parish Council would like to encourage young persons in the age
range 11-18 to join it to promote ideas and schemes which will be of benefit
to them. Younger volunteers will be especially welcome. If enough show
interest and wish to carry on there may have to be an election. Work on the
Upper Up cycle mounds will start shortly after Easter and any serious ideas
and help will be welcomed. This is your chance to have a "hands on"
decision in the creation of your own play area. For further information
contact <a href="mailto:joelodge@hotmail.co.uk">joelodge@hotmail.co.uk</a></font><a href="mailto:joelodge@hotmail.co.uk">

    <font size="4"><b>FLOOD FAIR<br>
    </b>Following flooding in parts of the Cotswolds last July, and earlier this year,
the Environment Agency, the National Flood Forum and Cotswold District
Council have organised a Flood Protection Products Fair at the Bingham
Hall, Cirencester on Friday 28th March between 2.30pm-7pm.</font>.
    </p>
    <font size="4"><b>MOBILE LIBRARY ARRANGEMENTS<br>
    </b>Please check out the notice board for the new times and parts of the village
which the mobile library will visit.</font>
    <p>
    <font size="4"><b>DOG MESS<br>
    </b>Although the majority of dog owners responsibly clean up any mess left by
their pets there are still those about who antisocially ignore all requests to
do so. The District Council is considering which dog control orders it will
adopt under its new power that will include the issuing of Fixed Penalty
Notices for offences. You have been warned.</font>.
    </p>
    <font size="4"><b>STREET TRADING (MOBILE ICE CREAM SALES)<br>
    </b>Two applications for licences to permit the sale of ice cream from mobile
dispensers in South Cerney were rejected by the Parish Council at its last
meeting.</font>
    <p>
    <font size="4"><b>POLICE INCIDENT COMMUNICATIONS<br>
    </b>A survey of those attending the Parish Council meeting on how satisfied
they were with the response from the operators answering 0845 090 1234
was very positive. All incidents should be reported to this number if the
case is a non emergency event.</font>.
