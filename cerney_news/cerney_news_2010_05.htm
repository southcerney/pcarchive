    <p align="left"><b>ROBERT FRANKLIN WAY PLAY EQUIPMENT</b> </p>

    <p align="left">Parish Councillors would like to give a big thank you to all the children and staff in the Reception Team at Ann Edwards School for their time and creativity with suggestions of potential new playgroup equipment for the Robert Franklin Way play area. The response to the request for suggestions printed in both the Cerney News and the Standard also resulted in some very useful feed-back and thanks to all who replied. The Parish Council will choose a contractor after further research.

    <p align="left"><b>DIGGER UPPERS</b> </p>

    <p align="left">Cotswold District Council recently granted approval for the change of use, from playing field to allotments, of an area bordered by the tennis courts and cricket pitch. The occupants of the allotments, now known as the Digger Uppers, have already cultivated and planted most of their plots and the area is looking very tidy. Demand for allotments is high with people on the waiting list. There is a difference of opinion with the planning authority as to which type of fencing is most appropriate. Negotiations are continuing and the Digger Uppers are researching alternative types of fencing and how to obtain grant funding.

    <p align="left"><b>CYCLING ON FOOTPATHS</b>

    <p align="left">Once again inconsiderate cyclists must be reminded that the public footpaths throughout the village are for the exclusive use of pedestrians. Cyclists should not ride their bikes on these paths particularly where signs prohibit the activity. It is dangerous to do so but more especially where residents' front doors open on to the pathway. One elderly resident narrowly escaped serious injury when a cyclist passed by on the footpath just as the person left the property.</td>
