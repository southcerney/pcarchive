<p align="left"><b>PARISH COUNCIL CHAIRMAN, VICE CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEES</b> </p>

At last week’s Parish Council meeting elections took place to
appoint officers and committees for the coming year. All members
agreed to remain in the same roles as previously listed in the
Village Directory and on the Parish Council web site
www.southcerney.org.uk.

</p>

<p align="left"><b>NEW PUBLIC SEATS</b> </p>

The Parish Council will install a new public seat, opposite the War
Memorial, to replace the old wooden one which was vandalised
beyond repair. This seat had been erected in memory of Jesse
Price a well known figure in his time in the village. Another seat
to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth II will be placed opposite the bus stop on land adjacent
to Kingfisher Place.

</p>

<p align="left"><b>COMPOST SCHEME</b> </p>

This scheme is sponsored by Gloucestershire County Council as it
saves it the cost of hauling the green waste across the county for
processing. The Parish Council receives payments for every tonne
produced and have the finished compost for disposal as we wish.
If you can assist by bringing your green waste to the Upper Up
site or want some compost please contact Mike Stuart 01285
860439.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>BT TELEPHONE KIOSK</b> </p>

For the past few months vandals continue to break the glass panes
in the telephone kiosk in High Street. The Parish Council appeals
to those individuals responsible to stop this moronic behaviour
because if they are caught action will be certainly taken against
them.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>PARISH COUNCIL ANNUAL PARISH MEETING</b> </p>

On Wednesday 15th May the Parish Council held its Annual
Parish Meeting in the Reformed Church in Clarks Hay. About 40
people attended to hear reports from the various local
representatives including the Parish Council, Cotswold District
Council, Gloucestershire County Council, Ann Edwards C of E
School, Revd Canon D. Bowers, Revd James Taylor and finally
from the Village Hall Management Committee.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>OPEN DAYS AT 29 REGIMENT, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER BARRACKS</b> </p>

Dave Martin announced at the Annual Parish Meeting on
Wednesday 15th May that Open Days will be held on 10th and
11th July. This event is primarily aimed at schools and local
dignitaries, but there may be interest from others in the parish
who sometimes wonder what might be going on behind the wire.
It may be possible to include a selective group from the village as
long as it is coordinated through a central point. If you are
interested in joining a group please contact Maurice McKee on
01285 644864 or by email <a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk">clerk@southcerney.org.uk</a> and he will
liaise with Mr Martin in organising a visit.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>REFURBISHED ENTRANCE TO THE UPPER UP CAR PARK</b> </p>

The refurbishment of the Upper Up car park continues with the
completion of a new entrance which should prevent large vehicles
from entering and causing surface damage. The redesign of the
parking area with bays separated by wooden slats will help to stop
those irresponsible drivers from creating doughnuts in the gravel
surface. Plans are being discussed to provide a hard wearing
surface which will make the area more user friendly especially in
wet weather.
</p>



<p align="left"><b>HORIZONTAL SWING AT ROBERT FRANKLIN WAY PLAY AREA</b> </p>

After many months of inaction, partly through the activity of
vandals and wear of the links which made the contraption
hazardous, the swing is once again back in working order.
