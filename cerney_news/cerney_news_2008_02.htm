    <font size="4"><b>RESIDENTS TO HAVE SAY IN COTSWOLD WATER PARK’S FUTURE<br>
    </b>People living within the Cotswold Water Park are being invited to comment
on plans for its future during a six-week public consultation. Comments can
be made via the online consultation until 7th March 2008. As well as
residents, all those interested in having a say in the area’s future are being
asked to visit the Cotswold Water Park Society's website 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.waterpark.org/">www.waterpark.org</a> 
    where there is an on-line survey to capture residents’ opinions and 
    feedback. </font>
    <p align="left">

    <font size="4">Commissioned by the Cotswold Water Park Joint Committee, 
    which is made up of the five local authorities with responsibility for the 
    area, together with the Cotswold Water Park Society, the plans set out a 
    long-term strategic vision for the development of the area over the next 20 
    years. </font>
    <p align="left">

    <font size="4">&quot;This consultation is an exciting opportunity for residents 
    to shape the future of their neighbourhood,&quot; commented Dennis Grant, chief 
    executive of the Cotswold Water Park Society. &quot;I'd encourage anyone 
    interested in the future of this area to visit the website and give us their 
    views on our plans.&quot; </font>
    <p align="left">

    <font size="4">&quot;The vision for the future includes a number of exciting 
    proposals which we believe will significantly benefit both local residents 
    and visitors. However, we’re keen to ensure that local residents have the 
    opportunity to review and comment on our plans, which is why we have 
    launched this consultation.&quot;</font>

    <font size="4"><b>THE COTSWOLD WATER PARK<br>
    </b>Established in 1967, Cotswold Water Park (CWP) covers an area of 40 square
miles of lakes and gravel workings around the upper reaches of the river
Thames.

</font>
    </p>

    <p>
    <font size="4">The CWP is managed by a Joint Committee made up of the five local
authorities with responsibility for the area - Gloucestershire and Wiltshire
County Councils, Cotswold, Swindon and North Wilts District Councils
together with the Cotswold Water Park Society.

</font>
    </p>

    <p>
    <font size="4">In 2006 the Joint Committee commissioned a strategic review to guide the
future development of the Park based on a clear, robust and evidence based
framework for delivering an achievable vision. The plan currently available
for consultation is part of this strategic review.</font>.
