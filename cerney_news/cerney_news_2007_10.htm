    <font size="4"><b>STATION ROAD SEAT<br>
    </b></font>The seat which was positioned at the junction of the Lennards and Station Road had to be removed because of damage to its concrete structure which made it unsafe. We may be able to replace it with a bus shelter and the Parish Council would welcome comments from residents on this plan.</p>
    <font size="4"><b>RECYCLING CONTAINERS AT UPPER UP<br>
    </b></font>The Parish Council requests that users of the recycling bins at Upper Up do not leave other rubbish at the site. Please take bags, etc home with you. The cardboard collection scheme is proving a big success and arrangements have been made for the skip to be emptied once a week.
    <p>
    <font size="4"><b>SPEEDING MOTORISTS<br>
    </b></font>Recently Parish Council members and PCSOs have carried out checks with speed cameras. Too many drivers were recorded exceeding the speed limits and have been reported to the Police who will be contacting them in due course.
