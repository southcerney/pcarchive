    <b><font size="4">Annual Parish Meeting</font></b><br>
    All members of the community are invited to attend the Annual Parish
Meeting of the South Cerney with Cerney Wick Parish Council which will be
held at South Cerney Village Hall on Wednesday 17th May at 7.30pm. The
Parish Meeting may by law discuss all parish affairs and pass resolutions
about them. Village organisations, Police and elected representatives of
District and County councils will be presenting reports.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Dog Mess</font></b><br>
    Irresponsible dog owners who do not collect their animals’ excretions are
bringing those who do into disrepute. Cllr Clive Bennett (CDC) reported
recently that after a stroll along the river bank he counted a total of 42 piles
of dog mess. He noted that at the Village Hall end of the path is a bin
especially for owners to deposit the droppings of their animals which is
obviously ignored by some. The dogs cannot be blamed for the mess, the
fault lies with the owners who are too lazy to collect the defecation left by
their pets and put it in the receptacle provided. It is an offence to allow dogs
to foul paths.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Youth Parish Council</font></b><br>
    Under the guidance of Claire Dowan, CDC Youth Participation Officer, a
Youth Parish Council has been formed in South Cerney. Their elders on the
Parish Council congratulate the enthusiam of the eight young residents who
have volunteered as members and totally support the endeavour.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Highway Matters</font></b><br>
    The GCC has reorganised the structure of their highways organisation which
is now called Gloucestershire Highways. A freephone number 08000 514 514
will accept calls regarding highway matters. At a recent meeting Cllr Stuart
was assured that it was the intention of the new establishment to “get it right
first time”.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Senior Citizens Bus Passes</font></b><br>
    Those senior citizens in the community who opted to take advantage of the
free bus passes issued by the CDC and are confused by the rules which
govern its use need worry no longer. Cllr Peter Jay (860641) has acquired
informative leaflets which describe the use of these passes. He has also been
in consultation with CDC and is willing to advise residents on how and
where the passes may be used.</p>
