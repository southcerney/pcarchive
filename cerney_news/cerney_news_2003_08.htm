    <p align="center"><u><big><strong>PETITION</strong></big></u></p>
    <p align="left">The Parish Council wishes to thank all those residents who signed the
    petition in support of an application for grant funding to refurbish the play area at
    Robert Franklin Way playing field. In total there were 1,019 signatures. Thank you all for
    your support.</p>
    <p align="center"><u><big><strong>GRASS CUTTING</strong></big></u></p>
    <p align="left">The quality of grass cutting throughout the village this season has been
    noticeably of a lesser standard to that which residents have become accustomed. The
    contractors were regularly admonished and although it was continuously promised that the
    work would improve ­ in fact it did not. On Monday 11 August the Parish Council was
    informed that the contractors Jeremy Simmons Landscapes Ltd had gone into liquidation. The
    Parish Council is currently in negotiation with a local firm to take over the ground
    maintenance in the village for the remainder of the season.</p>
    <p align="center"><u><big>UPPER UP PARK</big></u></p>
    <p align="left">Before its July meeting a group of young men from the village led by
    André Genillard thanked the Parish Council for the new facilities it had created on the
    Upper Up playing fields. Cllr Harris reminded the Parish Council that the idea for the
    scheme had originally been conceived after a letter from André asking for some sort of
    activity area be provided for village youth</td>
