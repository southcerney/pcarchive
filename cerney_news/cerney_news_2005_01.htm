    <p align="left"><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">Wanton vandalism, 
    early on New Year's Day, to our War Memorial was committed by persons 
    unknown. Any information which might lead to the culprits' apprehension 
    should be given to the Gloucestershire Constabulary by telephoning 0845 090 
    1234. The disgust and revulsion in the community as a whole is palpable but 
    it brings home to all of us the type of individuals present in our society 
    who will stoop to such loutish behaviour. The pieces of the memorial have 
    been removed and estimates are awaited for its repair and cleaning. It will 
    be rebuilt.</p>

    <p>Upper Up Tree Planting</p>
    </b>
    <p>Cllr Harris reports that the tree planting scheme for Upper Up is gaining 
    in popularity and nearly all the oak trees have been allocated. Several 
    other varieties of trees are still available. You can contact Cllr Harris on 
    01285 861812.</p>

    <p>Berkeley Close, South Cerney</p>
    </b>
    <p>Residents should be aware of a proposal to put in place a Prevention of 
    Driving Order as part of the planning permission for new houses along 
    Berkeley Close. The proposal seeks to prohibit vehicles driving the full 
    length of the Close, as it is thought that there is good access from other 
    roads within the village.</font></td>
