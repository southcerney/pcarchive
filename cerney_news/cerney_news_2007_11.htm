    <font size="4"><b>Great Western Ambulance Service response times<br>
    </b></font>The Parish Council wishes to collate response times for local incidents including the good news as well as the not so good. Please inform the Clerk by email (<a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk">clerk@southcerney.org.uk</a>) or telephone (01285-644864). In common with all UK ambulance services Great Western Ambulance Service is required to achieve a set of response time targets. 
    <br>
    <u>Category A:</u> Reach 75% of immediately life threatening emergencies within 8 minutes. Presenting conditions which require a fully equipped ambulance to attend the incident must have an ambulance arrive within 19 minutes of the request for transport being made in 95% of cases. 
    <br>
    <u>Category B:</u> Reach 95% of non-life threatening emergencies within 19 minutes. 
    <br>
    <u>Category C:</u> Presenting conditions which are not immediately serious or life threatening. For these calls the response times standards are not set nationally but are locally determined. </p>
    <font size="4"><b>Bledisloe Cup for the Best Kept Village<br>
    </b></font>Although this year we were not included in the main awards we did gain a Highly Commended placing. The judges were very complimentary and their summing up remarks state “South Cerney is a mixed community that appears to “gel” very well. It is led by an active Parish Council that is evidently not content to sit on its hands. Routine work is attended to well and at the same time new projects are coming forward thick and fast. This is an excellent entry”. Their full report can be viewed on the web site

    <font size="4"><b>Resurfacing of Village Carriageways<br>

Planned dates are from 7th to 20th January. Work will be concentrated on Broadway Lane from the High Street to the industrial estates.
