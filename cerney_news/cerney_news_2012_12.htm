To date Parish Councillors have met with Col Bennett of the War Memorials Trust who was in favour of the plan to move it. Mike Napper (CDC Planning) who had discussed the proposal with the Conservation & Design Officer and both had no adverse comments regarding the scheme, subject to the satisfaction of the Highways Officer. Mark Power, Gloucestershire County Council Area Manager (Cheltenham, Cotswold, Tewkesbury) Highways Development Management had no objection to the move.
