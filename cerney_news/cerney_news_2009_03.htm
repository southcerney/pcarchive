    <font size="4"><b> TREE COMPETITION<br>
    </b></font>The Cotswold Tree Warden Group intends to create a record of note-worthy trees and tree projects in Cotswold District. It aims to do this through an inter-parish competition, which it hopes every parish will enter. The large number of classes means that no parish is disadvantaged.

    <p align="left">If photos are good enough and funding available, a more permanent record will be produced of the Cotswold treescape for the general public.

    <p align="left">It is hoped that this project will encourage parishioners to identify the many fine trees in the district which deserve to be better known. It will also help us to see how we can preserve and improve our inheritance.

    <p align="left">The competition runs from now until 21 November 2009. The same tree cannot be entered for more than one class. Trees must be within parish boundary. Entries should be supported by photo, measurements and description as appropriate. There will be prizes awarded. 1. Tree (single stem) with biggest circumference measured at 1.5m from ground. 2. Tree with widest spread of branches. 3. Most characterful 'ancient tree'. 4. Tree with most interesting history. 5. Most colourful free. 6. Tree with most impressive above-ground roots. 7. Tree with most interesting bark. 8. Record of largest number of trees planted as result of TW 
    initiative. 9. Record of successful seed sowing. 10. Record of most 
    significant school/young people involvement. 11. Most thriving millennium 
    yew. (photo &amp; dimensions). 12. Most oddly shaped tree. 13. Most 
    wildlife-hospitable tree (nests, bat roosts, identified invertebrates). 14. 
    Most photogenic tree. 15. Most typical tree of its species (photo). 16. Most 
    fruit-laden tree (photo). 17. Tree with biggest fruit (photo &amp; dimensions of 
    fruit). 18. Most interesting juxtaposition. 19. Rarest tree. 20. Tree 
    growing in most hostile environment. 21. Oldest tree (documentary evidence). 
    22. Multi-stemmed tree growing over widest area (Record or photo &amp; record). 
    23. Tree with other tree/plant growing in/on it. 24. A wonderful tree or 
    activity (say why) not covered by above classes.
