    &nbsp;<p align="left"><b>NEW ALLOTMENTS</b> <br>
Due to the exceptionally high level of need, your Parish Council is
considering setting up a group of small garden plots at Upper Up
playing fields. The land is situated behind the tennis courts and is rarely
used for any sports or leisure purposes. Some twenty plots of around 80
sq metres each could be provided but would need expenditure to make
the area secure etc. Before committing the community to such expense,
the Parish Council needs to be reassured that there are sufficient
numbers of people who will not only commit themselves to renting a
plot but will also become involved in being part of a self managing
group which will actually run the scheme. To gauge the level of
commitment we are asking all interested people to come to an informal
get together in the Committee Room of the Village Hall on Friday 5th
February at 7.30pm. If you cannot make that meeting please contact
Mike Stuart 860439 to confirm your interest. Please note that your
being on a “waiting list” for an allotment with Bruton Knowles agents
for the owners of the existing allotments will have no bearing on the
new allotments. This is an entirely different scheme. </p>

    <p align="left"><b>COMMUNITY AWARDS</b> <br>
Congratulations are in order for Marcus Mueller, Adam Richard, Ross
Sweetland and Shane Bumphrey all of whom have recently successfully
completed the Community Awards Programme ‘Project SC!’ with The
Prince’s Trust. The programme has been run with the support of
volunteers from the Cotswold Forest School. The team has been
involved in the renovation of the SC Football Club, the compost bins at
Upper Up, coppicing and planting willow in the community, building a
shelter for local children and constructing a compost loo in the woods!
The aim of ‘Project SC!’ has been to encourage them to develop their
skills in Goal Setting and Responsibilty, Team Work, Decision Making,
Problem Solving, Budgeting and Communication. We wish them all
well done and very much hope that they will continue in their
endeavours to support our local community projects in the future.</td>
