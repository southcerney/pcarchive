    <p><b><font size="4">South Cerney Drains</font></b><br>
    South Cerney has suffered enough with the effects of a faulty sewerage
system and at a recent meeting convened by our MP Mr Geoffrey
Clifton-Brown, many of us made our dissatisfaction known to
representatives of Thames Water.<p>There are three main sources of concern: fracturing of the main pipe
from Cerney to Shorncote; the state of the network of sewer pipes from
our dwellings to the pumping station with the associated risk of flooding
as happened some four years ago; and the totally unacceptable odour
that emits from the sewers especially in the area of Kingfisher Place and
its immediate surrounds.<p>Fortunately, the Thames Water engineer agreed that the pipes of the
pumping main are in need of renewal. These replacement works are
supposedly being completed by the end of 2007 with initial survey
works already started.<p>Regarding the pipes from dwellings to the pumping station, there have
been ongoing cctv surveys since the flooding but we were promised that
these will be completed by the end of April. A schedule of works will
then be prepared.<p>Thames Water was made aware of the problem of offensive odour and
promised further investigation. Apparently, it has a system to record
how critical a problem is and that is based on the number of telephone
complaints they receive relating to any particular situation. The more
complaints, the more likelihood there is of action! So we need YOUR
input. If and when you experience a problem with faulty drains or can
smell them, get on the phone to the Thames Water Help Desk 0845 9200
800 or email <a href="mailto:customer.feedback@thameswater.co.uk">customer.feedback@thameswater.co.uk</a> (if you use email
please copy your message to our MP at 
    <a href="mailto:cliftonbrowng@parliament.uk">cliftonbrowng@parliament.uk</a>).
We will monitor the situation and will take action as necessary.<p>A follow up meeting is to be held on Friday 29th September at 2pm in
the Village Hall.<p><b><font size="4">Upper Up Tree Planting</font></b><br>
    Cllr Harris has issued a final request to residents wishing to commemorate
an event of significance in their life by having a tree planted
with a plaque or a park seat installed on the playing field. For further
information please contact Cllr James Harris on 01285 861812.</td>
