    <p align="left"><strong>The Inspectors gave the following report:</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Our first impression as we arrived in the village was one of
    cleanliness with streets and pavements swept and no litter ... and then we could see why!
    Two gentlemen were engaged in litter collection, one using a long hook to extract from the
    roadside water course. We were assured that this was an ongoing, voluntary commitment not
    just for the Competition.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A real effort had been made. The bus shelter was in a pristine
    condition - we noted with interest how funds had been raised for this provision, paper
    salvage during the last war. The notice-board captured our attention immediately, about a
    dozen posters were equally spaced in two rows - we've never seen anything quite so
    eye-catching. One telephone kiosk was intact but another, we were told, had had several
    panes kicked in during a recent bout of vandalism. Nearby, a War Memorial was thankfully
    untouched but there was a profusion of plantains and dandelions growing between the
    stones.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Those in charge of the Churchyard had achieved a masterpiece,
    especially in view of its size and the many gravestones. Dominant in its secluded
    position, the thatched Village Hall was quite unique, proudly displaying last year's
    winning plaque - may there be many more! We were drawn to the sparkling stream opposite -
    it all looked so <em>wholesome</em>.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>A vast area has been secured for recreation, well tended, with we
    understand promising plans laid for the future. A number of sports are catered for, with
    pavilions - surely this is what village life is about? The older generation with time on
    hand keeping the environment presentable for the young ones to enjoy and, hopefully,
    emulate.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>In the large category of parishes there is often, inevitably, one
    not-so-good section but this must not detract from the achievement of the major portion.
    In South Cerney we understand there has been serious flooding with unwelcome ancillary
    problems, leading to some dwellings/garages having been condemned. An air of neglect has
    resulted not entirely, we suspect, the fault of the population because we came across
    bright flowers occasionally conveying a defiant message.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Business premises throughout had played their part in making
    attractive displays for local people and visitors to enjoy.</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Regretfully we have to report to you that one of the other
    competitors has gained a slight edge - and we stress <em>slight</em> - over South Cerney
    but we want you to know that throughout we sensed a determined community effort to
    succeed, and we sincerely acknowledge and applaud your diligent work.</strong></td>
