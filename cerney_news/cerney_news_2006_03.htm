    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Mud on Spine Road</font></b><br>
Numerous people have complained to the Parish Council about the totally
unacceptable, dangerous state of the Spine Road and other roads due to mud
and debris from various quarries and building sites in and around our parish.
Please be assured that your Parish Council has been active in their efforts to
have the mud cleaned away and to stop the contractors responsible from
continuing to deposit further debris. Unfortunately, we have no direct authority
in this situation and have to rely on our colleagues in the District and County
Councils to apply the necessary pressure to obtain results. We have continually
lodged complaints to every authority available but with only limited success.
A new joint initiative between the four main local authorities has instigated a
very limited number of times when the Spine Road will be cleaned during
the year. These works will be paid for out of your Council Tax.
We believe that the contractors responsible for leaving the mud on the roads
are the ones who should be paying, not us. Furthermore, as it is a criminal
offence to deposit mud on the highway, the offending drivers should be
prosecuted by the police but to our knowledge, no such actions have been
taken. We will continue our efforts to seek a solution but are disheartened by
the apparent lack of urgency in certain “higher authorities”.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">South Cerney smells!</font></b><br>
    In February we asked that anyone experiencing bad smells from the sewers
to email customer.feedback@thameswater.co.uk or ring the Thames Water
Help Line on 0845 9200 800 to notify them. They have this system to accept
complaints so please use it to let them know if you have a problem.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Faulty Street Lights</font></b><br>
    The free number to call if you spot a streetlight not working is 0800 542
1890. Please attempt to note the number painted on the lamp post before you
call as it helps to identify the location.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">South Cerney Youth Parish Council</font></b><br>
    Our latest and exciting project is the formation of Youth Parish Council.
Working in conjunction with the CDC, we have had two exploratory
meetings attended by several young Cerneyites and there will be a further
meeting at the Committee Room at the Village Hall on Tuesday 28th March
at 6.30pm. Any young person aged between 11 and 18 wishing to be part of
this scheme designed to give the youth of the village a say in their own
future, is welcome to attend. For more details ring Mike Stuart 860439.</p>
