    <p align="left"><b>"GET YOUR WAY"</b> </p>

    <p align="left">Several young people including members of our Youth Parish Council helped Mary Mychaleckyj from the Gloucestershire Youth and Community Service and our own Youth Worker, Emily Hallet to organise an extremely well attended "Get Your Way" event on the Upper Up playing fields on Friday 30th July. With live groups, five a side football, gladiator competition and street dance sessions a great time was had by well over one hundred young people most of whom started our new Village Plan by filling in a questionnaire about what they want in our village. The Parish Council would like to thank 
    everyone who did such fine work in making the day a roaring success.</p>

    <p align="left"><b>REFRESHING AND REVIEWING THE VILLAGE PLAN</b> </p>

    <p align="left">Our current Village Plan is now in need of updating so a meeting has been arranged for Wednesday 6th October at 7.30 pm in the Village Hall to discuss, with all interested parties, how they would like see the community develop in the next few years. This is an opportunity for you to influence the direction and future of village schemes and dreams.
    </p>
    <p align="left"><b>PRECEPT CONSIDERATIONS</b> </p>

    <p align="left">The Parish Council will decide its spending options early in January 2011 for the next year, i.e. from April 2011 through until March 2012. If there is any group in the village which would like to put in a bid for finance, now is the time to contact a Parish Councillor and make a case for funding. The Parish Council cannot make grants to individuals.

    <p align="left"><b>DIGGER UPPERS ALLOTMENT HOLDERS SUCCESSES</b>

    <p align="left">The new allotments at Upper Up are burgeoning despite not having started until Easter of this year. The Parish Council sponsored two classes at the Flower Show especially for these allotment holders. Six entered the "best collection of produce from my allotment" and every plot was inspected by a qualified RHS judge who awarded Miles King first prize. Everyone deserves congratulations for their efforts.
