    <font size="4"><b> ANNUAL PARISH MEETING<br>
    </b></font>The Annual Parish Meeting will be held in the village hall on
Wednesday 20th May at 7.30pm. This is your chance to hear reports
from and ask questions of the main bodies and organisations in your
village. Speakers will include representatives of the police, Army,
churches, school and Parish Council.

    <font size="4"><b> RECYCLING BINS AT UPPER UP<br>
    </b></font>The Parish Council is concerned with the amount of large items, not all
for recycling, which are being left in the vicinity of the recycling bins at
Upper Up. If the practice continues and the Cotswold District Council
does not improve its clear up schedule, then the Parish Council will
terminate the agreement and ask that the bins are removed.

	    <font size="4"><b> DOG MESS<br>
	    </b></font>Complaints continue to be received about the amount of dog litter
which is being left in public places by the anti-social people who fail to
clean up after their pets. Those guilty if caught should be very aware
that the Cotswold Community Wardens now employed will be taking
steps to prosecute them. The problem is more acute in the vicinity of
Gypsy Lane and the Beverstone Road area. The majority of owners do
clean up after their dogs.

    <b><font size="4">TRAFFIC ISSUES WORKING PARTY</font></b><br>
    The Parish Council would like to hear from interested parties, if they
would be interested in joining a working party to propose initiatives to
improve traffic movements in South Cerney. In the first instance please
direct your replies to the Parish Clerk
