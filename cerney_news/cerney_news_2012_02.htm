<p align="left"><b>NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR'S COUNCIL TAX PRECEPT</b> </p>

The Parish Council has accepted the recommendation of its Finance Committee regarding the precept for the forthcoming financial year, April 2012 to March 2013. The budget details can be viewed on the Parish Council's web site www.southcerney.org.uk. Underspent budgets, a transfer from reserves and an increase in the number of homes has enabled the Precept to remain neutral with no increase in the base Band "D" demand. The Parish Council will support several community groups through the Village Plan Budget. R-Way the youth group, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Cerney Wick play equipment, the Play Group, the United Church, Football Clubs, the Upper Up car park and the compost scheme will all benefit.

<p align="left"><b>WILLOW PAGEANT 2012 'CREATURES OF THE NIGHT'</b> </p>

The Willow Pageant this year will be held in South Cerney at the Upper Up playing field. In Our Element Arts team will be running willow lantern workshops throughout February in preparation for the big extravaganza! The pageant will take place on Friday 2nd March (subject to funding) commencing at 18.30 hrs. Please endeavour to leave your car at home as we have very limited parking. We'll be advertising in the local press, shops and on notice boards further details . . . keep an eye on the Bat!

<p align="left"><b>PUBLIC ACCESS DEFIBRILLATOR</b> </p>

The Parish Council has already received several kind pledges and donations of funds for the purchase of a community Public Access Defibrillator (cPAD) in South Cerney, but we are still £500 short of the target. The automated external defibrillator (AED) is designed for use by untrained members of the public, since it automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. The AED would be supplied in partnership with the Great Western Ambulance Service and placed in a coded box accessed in conjunction with a 999 call for an ambulance. Any further donations and pledges would be very welcome, so please contact the Clerk at <a href="mailto:clerk@southcerney.org.uk">clerk@southcerney.org.uk</a> or at 6 North Home Road, Cirencester GL7 1DP telephone (01285) 644864
