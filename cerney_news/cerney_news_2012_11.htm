<p align="left"><b>PRECEPT MEETING</b> </p>

All residents are invited to attend a public meeting on <b>Wednesday 7th November at 7.30 pm</b> in the Village Hall. The meeting is to explain how the Parish Council makes its financial plans for the coming fiscal year starting April 2013. It will be shown how a grant from the Parish Council could help the aspirations of local groups which have the best interests of the Parish of South Cerney in mind. Parish Councillors will gauge the feelings of villagers if there should be a need to increase the amount collected in Council Tax which is currently £45.32 a year for a Band D dwelling. If a club or recognised grouping are intending to make a bid for a grant it is vitally important that a representative is present at the meeting. Be advised that failure to attend the meeting may exclude any bid for a grant.

<p align="left"><b>OVERGROWING HEDGES</b> </p>

Every year this perennial problem persists. The Parish Council does not wish to be over zealous in its 
    insistence that residents who let their hedges inconvenience other members of the parish, including those in Cerney Wick, should take responsibility and cut them back. It is a last resort in writing to individuals who do not conform to show consideration for this proper husbandry. Consequently could all residents who have hedges overgrowing public footpaths please make an effort to cut them back?

<p align="left"><b>EARLY EVENINGS</b> </p>

As the seasons progress, the lighting up time becomes ever earlier. In the interests of safety 
    cyclists especially should suitably attire themselves with high visibility jackets and have their bikes adequately lit, primarily to be seen by other road users.
</p>

<p align="left"><b>VILLAGE HALL THATCH</b> </p>

If you have not already done so, residents should visit the Village Hall in School Lane to appreciate the skill of modern thatchers in an old fashioned art. The front facing roof has been transformed with a new layer of thatch to protect the structure from adverse weather and to insulate the building. The rear roof will need to have similar treatment but not for a few years yet.
