    <font size="4"><b>BLEDISLOE CUP SUCCESS<br>
    </b></font>South Cerney has been judged as Runner Up in the final round of the large village section of the Bledisloe Cup competition. A full report from the final inspector is on 
    <a target="_blank" href="bledisloe08.pdf">our web site.</a> Congratulations to all who continually strive to make this the best large village in Gloucestershire. Well done!

    <font size="4"><b>DREDGING OF THE RIVER CHURN<br>
    </b></font>Dave Ludford, Flood Risk Management Officer at the Environment Agency wishes to inform residents that a team will be removing excess gravel from the river Churn alongside School Lane and Bow Wow, and also at The Chapter Manor. The works are due to start on 3rd November and continue for two weeks. The site hours will be from 7am until 5pm. The nature of the works and width of the site dictate that Bow Wow will be blocked for long periods of the working day. However, the team will do its best to keep delays to a minimum. We would ask residents, pedestrians and drivers to be patient throughout this period of disruption and the team will make every effort to minimise the inconvenience.

    <font size="4"><b>BOW WOW SEAT<br>
    </b></font>Contractors working on the river bank in Bow Wow allegedly damaged the Millennium seat so badly that it has been decided to replace it, at their expense, with a type similar to the majority of public seats throughout the village.
    <p>

    <font size="4"><b>POLICE MEETING<br>
    </b></font>If you are interested or concerned with the level of policing in the village, for example anti-social behaviour, speeding traffic, inconsiderate parking on kerbs or whatever, now is your chance to make your views known to those responsible for upholding the law. A meeting of the Neighbourhood Panel has been arranged for Friday 14th November at 7.30pm in the Village Hall. Everyone is encouraged to attend.
