<p>Hi Laura</p>
<p>Not really a matter for a new Forum but you didn't leave an address so this 
is the only way we can contact you.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the Nostalgia Show is nothing to do with the Village of South 
Cerney. Someone must organise it but it takes place on the airfield which now 
belongs to the Army. If you would like to send an e-mail to me at
<a href="mailto:rfenton@southcerney.com">rfenton@southcerney.com</a> I will 
endeavour to find out some more details for you.</p>
